00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,660
<i>LOS ANGELES.CALIFORNIA</i>

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,500
they ran the projection
you asked for, general.

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,190
you're clear. Go ahead.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,760
<i>{\a6}CHICAGO,ILLINOIS</i>

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,980
There's been a complication.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,000
Burrows and scofield have
been transferred to...

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,080
I read the newspapers.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,230
You don't have to tell me
what's in the headlines.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,610
The exact penitentiary where
they're being held is undisclosed.

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,570
But you can guarantee it'll be federal.

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,640
Supermax.

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,330
No more updates.

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,060
Call me when they're dead.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,780
Welcome to los angeles.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,780
As it turns out, men
who have escaped not one,

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,110
but two penitentiaries, are
considered a bit of a flight risk.

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,470
So we need to know where you are
and what you're doing at all times.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,500
Theses are gps ankle monitors.

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,070
Now step up, take one and put it on.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,700
I ain't wearing that.

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,660
Let's make this clear: I'm your ally,
but more importantly, I'm your boss.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,140
Which means if this fails-- it's my ass on
the line as much, if not more, than yours,

23
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,930
so from this point on, if I ask
you to do something, you do it.

24
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,270
If I ask you to say
something, you say it.

25
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,360
And if I ask you to put on a
monitor-- you put on a monitor.

26
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,090
As far as the general
public is concerned,

27
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,940
you're being contained in a supermax
facility somewhere in the united states.

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,070
So to avoid any messy explanations
and stay off the company's radar--

29
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,200
you need to keep your heads
down and your ears open.

30
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,830
We've provided cell phones,
clothing, and toiletries--

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,430
all the basic necessities
to get you up and running.

32
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,250
Hey, uh, you-you patted these guys
down before you let them in, right?

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,630
'Cause I can't be getting
shanked or shivved.

34
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,460
Who's this?

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,800
This is roland glenn.

36
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,850
He'll be assisting you.

37
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,090
We've already got our team.

38
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,480
No, scofield, see, this is my team,

39
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,250
and roland's working off a
sentence just like the rest of you.

40
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,820
In fact, with the amount of security
that's gonna be around scylla,

41
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,950
roland's expertise will be a necessity.

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,250
So, if no more questions, let's
get to work on finding scylla.

43
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,540
What about that second step?

44
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,550
What about the break-in?

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,390
You let me worry about step two, okay?

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,990
You just worry about finding scylla.

47
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,760
I've got an idea where to start.

48
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,960
That's excellent, alexander.

49
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,270
See, there's a man who's thinking.

50
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,580
All right, let's let
these men get to work.

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,860
Good luck. To all of us.

52
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,450
Yeah, since I was here first I think I'll just go
ahead and grab that S.S. Bedroom, if that's cool.

53
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,690
- Sara...
- yeah?

54
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
You take the bunk.

55
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,000
You know, when this is, when this is all
done-- you and me, we're gonna settle up.

56
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,800
All right, obviously, there's
a lot of history in this room.

57
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,010
That's a given.

58
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,060
But it we're gonna pull this
off, it's gonna take all of us.

59
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,510
We got to work together.

60
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,200
So if anyone has a
problem, get it out now.

61
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,230
You want to clear the
air with someone...

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,720
now's the time.

63
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,290
All right. Let's get to work.

64
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,130
Whistler's assignment was to drop
off this, this, this data card--

65
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,280
th-this 'scylla' to
a company executive.

66
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,410
Someone he referred
to as "the cardholder."

67
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,700
And his job was to-to protect it.

68
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,410
To... keep it safe.

69
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,030
Now, I didn't see who he was,
but I got a look at his driver.

70
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,300
His driver?

71
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,990
You want to sketch this guy's face and match
it up to 10 million people in los angeles?

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,270
Well, that's just great.

73
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,700
I saw more than just the guy's face.

74
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,350
All the drivers were hanging around, talking
shop, but this guy, he was standing by himself.

75
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,210
Legs apart, hands behind his back,
at rest-- he's former military.

76
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,150
His car rides a little
lower than the rest of 'em.

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,780
Probably signifies private security.

78
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,800
Weighed down by bulletproof siding.

79
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,240
His suit,
his suit--

80
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,960
you don't buy a suit like that on a cop's
salary or pulling weekend gigs as a driver.

81
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,930
That means he's full-time.
He's highly paid.

82
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,180
You ask our friend mr.
Self to run tax records

83
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,020
on the 45- to 55-year-old white males in
los angeles drawing a military pension,

84
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,620
and taking six figures from
a private security company,

85
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,870
and you narrow your field
from 10 million till about 50.

86
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,080
And then I can pick
the guy out from there.

87
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,330
Find the driver, you
find the cardholder.

88
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,240
<i>MEXICAN DESERT 60...........</i>

89
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,150
We haven't ate or
drank anything for days.

90
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,360
Oh, I don't want to die out here.

91
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,440
We ain't gonna die, sancho.

92
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,750
- we ain't gonna die.
- Okay.

93
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,600
We just gotta find what's
called a compass cactus.

94
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,000
Due to the fact it always
leans toward the south.

95
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,480
Inside there's delicious fruit
which'll fill our bellies.

96
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,720
Plus, we find out which way is south, we're
gonna find out which way is north. ¿Comprende?

97
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,870
tell you what. Why don't we,
uh, rest here for a while, huh?

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,430
Travel at night when it's cooler.

99
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,870
That sounds good.

100
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,810
What are we gonna do when we get there?

101
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,690
To san diego.

102
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,910
You mean after michael pays for
the vile he's transgressed upon me?

103
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm still trying to figure that out.

104
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,790
Nice to work with homeland.

105
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,480
The fbi would take days
to gather this intel.

106
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,970
Well, the fbi should'a hired me 'cause I could've
gotten whatever info you wanted in 25 minutes tops.

107
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,960
You some kind of hacker?

108
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,420
I design silicon lithography
for personal gain.

109
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,020
He's an identity thief.

110
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,200
He's a douche.

111
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,690
Hey, why don't you sit in the corner
and we'll get you when we need you.

112
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,530
This is him. That's the driver.

113
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:29,960
Now what?

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,190
Well, he takes us to the cardholder,
and the cardholder takes us to scylla.

115
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,360
You could have left me there, in jail.

116
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,410
Could have or should have?

117
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,650
Maybe both.

118
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,710
- Are you thanking me, alex?
- I don't know.

119
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,940
Don't bother. You're here because we
needed you. Not because we wanted you.

120
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,240
That's him. That's the guy.

121
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,720
What's that, private security?

122
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,130
It's like a fortress.

123
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,180
Slow down. Slow down.

124
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,050
This thing we gotta get, it's in there?

125
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,230
Motion sensors, alarm
systems, armed guards.

126
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,660
In and out of that place
without anybody knowing.

127
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,240
You better have one
hell of a plan, michael.

128
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,510
So, basically, there's no freaking
way to break in to the place.

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,640
Not quickly. Not without being seen.

130
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:48,460
What about the neighbors, uh, somewhere we
can be staged from, you know, go under and up?

131
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,680
Closest neighbor is
here, across the street.

132
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,040
And even that would take weeks.

133
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,110
The government's story about us being
held in a supermax will only last so long.

134
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,190
What does that mean?

135
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,630
I mean, then what if
somebody finds out we're not.

136
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,280
What if we don't have
to be in the house?

137
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,050
If the card-- this scylla-- is so important
maybe the guy is carrying it on him.

138
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,340
Well, according to public records, the
owner of the estate's name is stuart tuxhorn,

139
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,660
and he's a ceo of a
company called spectroleum.

140
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,320
Heavy hitter like that's
gonna have security 24-7.

141
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,560
And we gotta get this thing without
anyone knowing it's gone, right?

142
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,030
So even if he's got it on
him, how do we get it off him?

143
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,820
You don't steal the card. You copy it.

144
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,110
Oh, now you're interested
in what I gotta say, right?

145
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,560
Copying it will make it harder.

146
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,630
Not only do you have to steal
it, you have to return it, genius.

147
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,410
Only if you don't got me, hombre.

148
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,730
What's that?

149
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,210
This is the reason I got busted.

150
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,790
Oh, you stole the cell phone?

151
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,150
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I'm lookin' at federal
time 'cause I stole a cell phone-- seriously?

152
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,120
I invented this so that
I don't have to steal.

153
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,530
It looks like a cell phone but it's
really like a digital black hole.

154
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,230
Wireless hard drive that swallows up any
electronic data within ten feet of it.

155
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,110
Like what?

156
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,390
Like the account info of anyone at
starbucks with a latte and a laptop.

157
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,340
Like the pin number of any
credit card used at a gas pump.

158
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,990
I can walk out of here and get the identities and
financial statements of ten people in ten minutes,

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,020
on a slow day, with one hand on my junk.

160
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,420
And the information embedded in scylla?

161
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,150
If we can get close enough...

162
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,390
it's ours.

163
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,970
<font color="#ffff00">Prison
Break Season04 Episode02</font>

164
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,060
is this number... acceptable to you?

165
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,030
10,000 people?

166
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,420
- Yes.
- Good.

167
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,980
Now that you're on board, we
can issue the op-order today.

168
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,530
He's on his way.

169
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,920
all right, hold on.

170
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,910
Sara, it's me.

171
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,000
Everybody's on.

172
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,290
Now, while I'm monitoring the device,

173
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,670
I'm not gonna be able to see
exactly what data's being copied.

174
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,350
But, like downloading quality
porn from the internet,

175
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,020
progress bar's gonna tell me
when it's time to rock and roll.

176
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,130
How long do they need to stay in range?

177
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,130
Encrypted data like this is
gonna take at least two minutes.

178
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,550
Here he comes. Sucre, you're on.

179
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,040
good luck.

180
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,470
easy.

181
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,600
Sir, would you mind stepping
away from the vehicle?

182
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,490
Talk to me, roland.

183
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,880
I got nothing, man.

184
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,760
Last time I had this little action, I was
dry humping my way through fifth grade.

185
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,410
Calm down.

186
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,750
sir... sir...

187
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,980
step away from the vehicle!

188
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,470
Okay, bro, just relax-- we
don't have to get all excited.

189
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,080
You speak english now.

190
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,650
Only a little, but, uh...

191
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,600
- how about now?
- Nada.

192
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,110
Try to get closer to them.

193
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,450
If he was any closer,
he'd be in the car.

194
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,960
I get your little act, pedro.

195
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,270
Hit the brakes, let the rich guy pay
for damage you don't intend to fix.

196
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,840
Just give the man some
money so we can leave.

197
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,680
congratulations.

198
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,530
He was there-- I think tuxhorn was
in the car. So did we get it or not?

199
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,430
Nope. Nothing.

200
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,290
Can I help you?

201
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,740
So how did you find me?

202
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,310
I never lost you.

203
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,650
The, uh, the new nose
threw me a bit, but...

204
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,840
what do you want, don?

205
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,980
I got customers.

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Look, back in the days, when
you worked with the company...

207
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,290
well, for the company.

208
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,420
I did economic forecasts
of their operations.

209
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,610
- I mean, I wasn't one of the guys...
- but you had access.

210
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,390
Come on-- the last
time I helped you,

211
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,090
the only thing I got out of it was
plastic surgery and a $100,000 pay cut.

212
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,580
You know, so either you buy one
of these exceptional family cars,

213
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,970
with above average gas mileage,
or you leave me the hell alone.

214
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,770
I know about scylla.

215
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,100
And I'm going after it.

216
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,950
You know, I knew you were crazy.

217
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,370
I didn't know you were stupid, too.

218
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,100
Well, let's just say I was
able to get my hands on it.

219
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,880
It's my understanding that scylla could only
be used if it's plugged into a decoder box

220
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,500
that's hidden in one of the
company facilities. Am I right?

221
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,010
You know, I wish I
could help, but I can'T.

222
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,870
No, you are helping, jasper.

223
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,220
Just a matter of whether you do it before or
after I shame you in front of your coworkers here.

224
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,100
Tell me where the company
keeps the box, jasper.

225
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,210
Could be anywhere; I don't know.

226
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,610
Somebody does. Right?

227
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,610
Somebody that you might have access to.

228
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,100
You know, if you go down this road,
your government job won't protect you.

229
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,850
Then I better not get caught, right?

230
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,400
If I don't find something to eat
soon, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

231
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,420
We're not gonna make it.

232
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,720
No, we got to, we got to
just keep talking, sancho.

233
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,580
Keep our brains focused on something other
than our empty bellies and our dry mouths, okay?

234
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:59,680
Come on. Let's start with,
uh, your-your favorite color.

235
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,180
hell you doing?

236
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,900
I'm hungry, teddy.

237
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,830
Why should the both of us die out here when
one of us could help the other one survive?

238
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,480
You don't want to do this.
Please. I'll make it quick.

239
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,610
I promise!

240
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,870
Sancho.

241
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,370
Sancho!

242
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,570
Why'd you have to go
and do something so...

243
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,650
So tuxhorn doesn't keep the card on him.

244
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,110
It must be in there.

245
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,800
look, there's no way we're getting
in that house without being seen.

246
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,930
I know.

247
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,980
Well, if the card's in
there, how we gonna copy it?

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,700
We're not.

249
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,930
She's gonna do it for us.

250
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,520
What you reading?

251
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,590
"There is no fighting her.

252
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,600
"No power can fight her.
All that avails is flight."

253
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,140
That's homer.

254
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,340
That's from the odyssey.

255
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,800
Is this from my father's folder?

256
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,350
Yeah. And it explains why
scylla sounded so familiar.

257
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,700
If I'm not mistaken, it's
from that chapter in the book

258
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,320
where odysseus is told he has to
confront a monster known as scylla.

259
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,390
Wonder why he wrote this down.

260
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,290
I could be wrong, but I believe odysseus is
told that in order to continue on his path,

261
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,880
to pass scylla, it'll require
the sacrifice of six of his men.

262
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,440
His only other alternative
is to abandon his path.

263
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,880
And he chooses to make the sacrifice.

264
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,430
Well, that's a hell of a choice.

265
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,730
One I'm not sure I'm comfortable making.

266
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,960
Sara, um, about tomorrow--
the plan, the housekeeper...

267
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,470
if you're not up to it...

268
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,750
no, no, I am.

269
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,650
<i>CHICAGO,ILLINOIS</i>

270
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:06,950
Tell me, is claudia
mauricio a good roommate?

271
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,740
A good person?

272
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,310
I hope she feels the same about you.

273
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,620
oh, shelby, you wouldn't
believe the traffic on the...

274
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,470
you'll want to be quiet now, claudia.

275
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,630
There are levels of clearance at the department
of corrections that are simply not available,

276
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,160
even for friends as connected as mine.

277
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:51,770
So, listen carefully, if you even
remotely value your friend's life.

278
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,250
You're going to use your security code to
access the records for prisoner transfers

279
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,380
and tell me where they sent michael
scofield and lincoln burrows.

280
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,100
Can I take that for you?

281
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,160
- Thanks.
- Sure.

282
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,020
That's a great bag. Can I
ask you where you got it?

283
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,240
It was a gift from my boss,
so I don't really know; sorry.

284
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,410
Sure.

285
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,270
- Thanks.
- There you go.

286
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,200
I, uh... I can never find a good bag.

287
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,380
I'm a teacher, and I have books
and grading materials and...

288
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,780
I should probably go ahead and just
invest in a wagon one of these days.

289
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,130
Yeah, that's why I love this
bag. It has so many pockets.

290
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,530
Do you mind if I take a look?

291
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,160
- Oh, no.
- Thanks.

292
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,440
ah, thank god, thank god.

293
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,270
You all right, mister?

294
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,610
Yeah, my damn truck blew
a gasket a few miles back.

295
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,750
I've been, uh, hoofing it ever since.

296
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,530
Where you headed?

297
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,050
San diego.

298
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,980
Hell, we can give you
a ride, if you'd like.

299
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,560
Hey, what's wrong, man?
Eat some bad mexican?

300
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,940
Something like that.

301
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,180
Same as yesterday, right on schedule.

302
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,650
I hope to hell she's still
got that thing in her purse.

303
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,950
tuxhorn residence.

304
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,480
Hello, I'm from the alarm company.

305
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,680
We've been receiving some, uh,
strange signals from your property.

306
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,100
We'd like you to check
the windows, please.

307
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,970
Make sure all the
contacts are still active.

308
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,460
All the windows?

309
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,000
Yes, ma'am. Every room in the house.

310
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,330
Okay, hold on.

311
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,370
Does she still have the bag?

312
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,230
Yeah.

313
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,440
she's got it.

314
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,580
I'm picking up all kinds
of gak from the house,man.

315
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,470
Small stuff,maybe a digital
camera,an mp3 player.

316
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,650
Nothing of the size of what
we're looking for,though.

317
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,560
Keep her moving.

318
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,750
So far,so good,ma'am.

319
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,860
Uh,please move on to the next room.

320
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,620
How we doing?

321
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,330
Still don't got it.

322
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,530
If the card's in there,it'd
be in some kind of...

323
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,510
a safe.

324
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,540
Office.

325
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,450
Ma'am,our system is
showing that thealfunction

326
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,800
is coming from a room that's
designated as,uh,an office or a den.

327
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,130
You mean the library?

328
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,820
Mister doesn't like me going in there.

329
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,600
Well,I think he'd like it
even less if you went home

330
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,620
without properly setting the
alarm first,don't you think?

331
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,340
All right,I'll check.

332
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,930
We got something.

333
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,240
The card?

334
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,300
Oh,yeah.File's so big it
can't be anything else.

335
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,140
Now you just gotta keep her there for
two minutes while it finishes the burn.

336
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,580
Stall her,we need two minutes.

337
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,340
Ma'am,I think we found
the source of our problem--

338
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,080
if you could just stay
at that particular window

339
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,940
and hold it closed while we reset
the system,that should do it.

340
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,650
Talk to me,roland.

341
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,140
It's almost there,almost,almost.

342
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,920
Come on,come on,come on,come on.Come on.

343
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,080
Come on,come on,come on,come on.Come on.

344
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,970
Come on.

345
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,270
- Got it.
- Got it

346
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,680
All right,ma'am,thank
you so much for your help.

347
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,970
All we need to do now,man,is just...

348
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,050
whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,she's
heading back inside.

349
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,830
What for?

350
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,140
I don't know.

351
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,450
Oh,no.

352
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,020
No,we're good.

353
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,890
She's out.

354
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,840
Hey,stop it!

355
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,270
Wait here.

356
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,390
I actually had to slow
down not to catch you.

357
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,360
I think I pulled a groin.

358
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,730
It's not in the bag.

359
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,500
It's not here.

360
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,210
How could it not be in here?

361
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,480
The device,it's not
here-- give me it.

362
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,620
son of a bitch.

363
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,470
Twenty-six...

364
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,940
Twenty-seven...

365
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,710
Go ahead.

366
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,130
Before burrows and scofield were
allegedlly transferred to arlington,

367
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,460
someone posted their bail.

368
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,920
I need to know who.

369
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:22,190
I'm showing a bruce bennett,former
aid to governor frank tancredi.

370
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,020
You think it fell out?

371
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,610
We looked everywhere.

372
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,030
You think we got the thing copied?

373
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,660
Like I said,I can't read the content
without downloading the device,but...

374
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,940
unless this tuxhorn's got,like,a
50,000-hour tivo,then,yeah,I think we got it.

375
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,610
Doesn't matter if we got
it if we can't find it.

376
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,170
Where the hell is it?

377
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,290
It's still inside the house.

378
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,720
That's why the maid went back inside.

379
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,220
She must have found it,assumed it belonged
to her boss,and then she left it behind.

380
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,060
Well,then guess
what,fellas,it's game over.

381
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,490
You know how many months it took
me to make that thing,michael?

382
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,710
What,you just think I can whip
up another e in a couple seconds?

383
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,230
Losing it is not the problem.

384
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,130
If they find it,that's the problem.

385
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,640
If they find out someone was
after that card,we're done.

386
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,850
What do you mean,done?What
does that mean?

387
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,050
Does that mean we're
gonna go back to prison?

388
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,140
Are they gonna kill us?

389
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,050
- What the hell does that mean?
- Shut up!

390
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,550
It means we're going in to get it.

391
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,910
Maybe if we had a few days,we could
figure out a way to pull this off,

392
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,930
but I gather we don't
have that kind of time.

393
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,120
Yeah,you gather right.

394
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,060
Look,if you want us to get that device
out of there,you gotta throw us a bone,

395
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,400
give us some extra help.

396
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,080
What you're asking for requires
involving additional people,

397
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,920
which,given the covert nature
of this operation,I cannot do.

398
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,210
Then you're asking for the impossible.

399
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,370
No,what I'm asking
for is competence,okay?

400
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,530
I'm not the one who put the entire
mission in the hands of a damn maid.

401
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,460
Look,if the company finds that
copy of scylla before we do,

402
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,920
that's it,michael,that's ball game.

403
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,040
They're gonna find out who was behind
it,and they're going to ghost us.

404
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,110
All of us.

405
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,380
Are you okay?

406
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,210
yeah.

407
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,070
I'm fine.

408
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,310
Look,I didn't choose you to do
this because I had you in custody.

409
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,470
I chose you to do this because
I believed you could pull it off.

410
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,670
Yeah,well,a lot of people have believed
in me in the last few months,agent self.

411
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,510
Not all of them are alive today.

412
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,600
Can you get me back the device or not?

413
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,170
All right,this is what we got.

414
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,920
The housekeeper saw the device
as she was leaving the house.

415
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,720
Then she disappears back
inside for 15 seconds.

416
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,920
So,we know,wherever it is,it's
somewhere close to the door.

417
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,330
So,15 seconds,that's all
we have to buy ourselves.

418
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,920
Listen,I'm not sure how close
we're gonna get to this house,

419
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,750
let alone inside of it,but
let's say that we do.

420
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,170
The alarm they got installed in
this house is triggered 1.2 seconds

421
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,430
after broken contact
in any door or window.

422
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,440
Which would immediately send
the private security guards

423
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,830
with their 47 guns
rushing into the property.

424
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,010
And after 30 seconds,the alarm company
will dispatch vehicles to the property.

425
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,180
Three to four,depending on availability.

426
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,800
After confirmation of a break-in,

427
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,560
they'll dispatch additional vehicles to
seal off any and all exits from the property.

428
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,750
I don't know about this,michael.

429
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,870
It's getting pretty clear why they
hired a bunch of cons to do this job.

430
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,740
It's not because they
wanted it off the books.

431
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,270
It's because we're expdable.

432
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,490
Who's gonna care if a bunch
of crooks wind up dead?

433
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,720
It's suicide.

434
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,930
I'm gonna keep looking
and see what I can find.

435
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,930
Thuote from the odyssey.

436
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,490
What about it?

437
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,480
I can't shake that line.

438
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,760
"All that avails is flight."

439
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,520
What if flight is our
onlyly option,linc?

440
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,020
What if our father-- after everything
he discovered about the company-- what...

441
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,880
what if that's what he finally realized?

442
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,930
You know,uh,the one thing I remember
most about dad was the back of his head.

443
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,090
Always walking out the front door.

444
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,410
Always running from something.

445
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,320
Mom,us,himself.

446
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,410
But the one thing he never ran away from

447
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,640
was his belief that the
company needed to be taken down.

448
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,450
And we got an opportunity to do that.

449
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,270
Then this is our fight,not theirs.

450
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,150
Man,this...

451
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,440
this ain't fox river.

452
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,830
These guys chose to be here.

453
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,090
Remember that.

454
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,550
They got a choice.

455
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,700
Almost.

456
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,630
Ready?

457
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,920
Go.

458
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,210
Go.come on.

459
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,970
let's go.

460
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,910
Where's it coming from?

461
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,640
It's across the street.

462
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,200
Come on.

463
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,970
go.

464
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,390
Just something across the street.

465
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,250
We got a team checking it out now.

466
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,450
You can go back inside,sir.

467
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,040
must be out of town.

468
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,000
Daddy,is everything okay?

469
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,330
Alex...

470
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,780
thanks,jim.

471
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,220
Alex!

472
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,970
Let's go.

473
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,370
go!

474
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,300
Don't turn around,

475
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,900
unless you'd like to experience a great deal
of pain over an even greater length of time.

476
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,200
You-you know, just-just
take whatever you want here.

477
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,000
The only thing I want from you, bruce,

478
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,900
is the answer to a simple question:

479
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,500
Where are michael scofield and lincoln burrows?

480
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
I only know what-what I read in the papers and...

481
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,623
three days ago, there were 105 inmates

482
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:28,473
in the supermax wing of
the U.S. Penitentiary in livingston, texas,

483
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,400
where the brothers were allegedly sent.

484
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,500
There are still 105 inmates there,

485
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,700
and no one has been released during that time.

486
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,500
Someone is playing a shell game, bruce.

487
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,400
I'm just trying to find out who.

488
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,500
I have no criminal jurisdiction over...

489
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,700
I know you bailed them out.

490
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,700
I know you've been in contact with sara tancredi.

491
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,900
I swear to you, I-I have no idea where they are.

492
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,400
I guess we'll see about that.

493
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,900
good luck, teddy.

494
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Who needs luck when you got
friends like you fellas, huh?

495
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,700
hey, you mind if I take this
old newspaper of yours with me?

496
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,400
No problem. Sorry to hear about your friend, dude.

497
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,400
it's all right.

498
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,300
He had a full life.

499
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,800
Later, teddy.

500
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,700
SanDiego.PC Line.B12.36-24-36

501
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,800
Pacific Coach Lines

502
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,400
There you go.

503
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Thirty-six, twenty-four, thirty-six.

504
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,400
Gate Corporation

505
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,500
LA

506
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,300
Did you get it?

507
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,100
Let's make sure we got what we wanted.

508
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,200
- Linc.
- Yeah.

509
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,400
- Don't let that thing out of your sight.
- All right.

510
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,600
We're halfway there.

511
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,800
All we got to do is that little b and e,
and- we're out of here.

512
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,000
Reminds me, I need to get ahold of self,
see when we can get started.

513
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,700
So what are you gonna do when all this is over?

514
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,900
That's a good question.

515
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,400
Brother, whatever this scylla thing is,
it is a monster of a code.

516
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,700
sara,

517
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,400
I was gonna come down here and ask if you wanted
to talk some more about what happened in panama,

518
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,500
but, um, I think I already
know what you're gonna say.

519
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,400
How's that?

520
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Because you're a little like me.

521
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,500
Because you're gonna say you're fine,
that you can handle it.

522
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,200
So, um, I'll just leave it at this.

523
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,200
I'm here.

524
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,300
Whenever you want to talk, I'm here.

525
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,600
Thank you.

526
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,296
You know that the only thing that

527
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:32,138
kept me alive when I was being held
was the thought of being with you.

528
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,400
But I also knew that if anything happened
to me, you were gonna blame yourself,

529
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,200
and you would spend the rest of your life
puniing yourself for it, and...

530
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,800
I can't bear the thought of that.

531
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,700
So can we make a deal right now that we're even,
and just wipe the slate clean

532
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,800
and no guilt and no responsibility?

533
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,800
If we're gonna be together, I don't want
it to be out of a sense of obligation.

534
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:07,800
Or-or even that we should be,
because of what we've been through. I-I...

535
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,800
I just want to start over.

536
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,400
Start over.

537
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:20,100
Okay. But, uh, does that mean
I have to divorce my wife?

538
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,000
because you're still married
to a russian stripper.

539
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:30,000
Well, "a": I've been a little busy,
and "b": I'm pretty sure she was czech.

540
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,400
Hey, michael.

541
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,300
What's wrong?

542
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,300
- Whatever it is, it ain't it.
- I don't understand.

543
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,600
- I thought you said we copied the card.
- No, we did.

544
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,400
But according to the encryption code...
okay, how do I make this clear?

545
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,900
If-if scylla was like a pizza,
all we got's a slice.

546
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,300
- So where's the rest of the data?
- I don't know.

547
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
I don't know. I mean...

548
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,800
I mean, I don't know how we didn't see this coming.
I mean, it-it makes perfect sensE.

549
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,300
It's like the nuclear launch codes.

550
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,900
You don't give all that information
to just one person.

551
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,100
How many do you give it to?

552
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Okay, that quote your father held onto-

553
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,196
in the odyssey, scylla is a six-headed monster

554
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:09,211
that requires a sacrifice of
six soldiers in order to pass.

555
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,700
So scylla isn't one card,

556
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,300
it's six.

557
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,100
What does that mean?
How we gonna find five more of these things?

558
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,500
Michael! Michael!

559
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,500
I'm busy.

560
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,500
I don't care what she looks like.

561
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,700
Three tablespoons of water, one of honey.
Nothing more.

562
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,900
If she knows something about anything
that's going on, I'm going to find it.

563
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,900
Rise and shine, bitch.

564
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Breakfast.

565
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,000
Michael?

566
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,900
You all right?

567
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

568
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,100
All this security makes you wonder
what the company's hiding.

569
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,700
Only way to know for sure is to
find those five other cards, see for ourselves.

570
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,500
- Think we'll have enough time?
- Yeah.

571
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,600
We'll, uh... we'll be fine.

572
