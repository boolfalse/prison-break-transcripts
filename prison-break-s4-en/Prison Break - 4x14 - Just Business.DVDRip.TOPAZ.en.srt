1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,911
<i>Previously on Prison Break...</i>

2
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:07,714
You have a hypothalamus hamartoma.
And the doctor feels that you need surgery.

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:08,947
You could die.

4
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:12,684
- You're not following direct orders.
- Oh, I'm following direct orders, sir.

5
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:15,058
Just not from you anymore.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,856
I would have died on this table
if it weren't for you, doc.

7
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:21,558
- What?
- Time to come home now.

8
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:24,364
- You're gonna help me find a buyer.
- Hi name is Vikan.

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,063
He's not a buyer. He's a conduit.

10
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:28,709
Let's go. And Bagwell's staying here.

11
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:30,468
I warned you not to screw me over.

12
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:34,308
- It's been a long time, Gretchen. Who's he?
- I'm the guy that's holding Scylla.

13
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:35,642
It's incomplete.

14
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:37,546
There's a piece missing, slick.

15
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:42,613
Hello, Don.

16
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,452
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

17
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:46,651
Come and get it.

18
00:00:56,738 --> 00:00:59,502
Just so it's fresh in your mind,
this isn't a magic elixir.

19
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:01,635
You still need a hospital.

20
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:04,004
You need real equipment.

21
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,344
You could use a doctor who's still got
a license to practice medicine.

22
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:12,748
Well, first, we get Scylla,
then I'll go to the hospital.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,324
- You finished?
- Just about.

24
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:04,729
- I take it you're ready to talk now?
- Actually, I'm ready to meet.

25
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:06,567
I got a better idea.

26
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:16,042
Everyone, out.

27
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:30,228
You're surrounded. Come out
with your piece of Scylla, Michael.

28
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:32,059
You first.

29
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:35,065
Come out or I'm gonna gas you out.

30
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:39,730
If it's the latter,
I have a full magazine with 30 rounds.

31
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:41,670
Wanna bet one of them can outrun you?

32
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:44,107
What makes you think
I'd keep the piece on me?

33
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:47,008
Oh, I know you. You're not letting that
out of your sight.

34
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:48,944
I stand by my original offer.

35
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:51,278
- Come and get it.
- Okay.

36
00:02:54,956 --> 00:02:57,390
Stay low. Let the gas rise to the ceilings.

37
00:02:57,558 --> 00:03:01,050
This is a big space but it won't take
many of those before we asphyxiate.

38
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:03,060
Where is Lincoln?

39
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:07,367
Here we go, Michael.

40
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:52,411
Now we take a ride,
and we pick up Scylla.

41
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,674
- Or I put a bullet in your head.
- It ain't gonna happen.

42
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,147
Try me.

43
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,522
Good morning.

44
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:08,053
Okay.

45
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:11,790
All right, now that we all have guns
pointed at us, let's talk, okay?

46
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,194
Fine.

47
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:16,666
You can start by telling me
who I'm talking to, Don.

48
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:20,968
You're talking to a guy who spent 17 years
in service of his government.

49
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:24,805
<i>You know what the sum total of it was?
Nothing, nada.</i>

50
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:26,310
Well, we're very similar.

51
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:29,882
And fundamentally, we want the same thing
and I have a way to get it.

52
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:32,110
- How's that?
- I got a buyer for Scylla.

53
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:34,914
A guy who wants to destroy the Company
as much as you do.

54
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,114
He's willing to pay a lot of money for it.

55
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,485
How much?

56
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,785
Nine figures.

57
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:41,826
In an offshore account of your choosing.

58
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:47,333
So there it is.
Or you could stand by your principals.

59
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:49,793
I'll pass.

60
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:53,031
Look, I burned you, right?
And I'd apologize, but what's the point?

61
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:55,368
We're all out in the cold now.

62
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:58,341
We're not gonna be able
to hide from the Company on a budget.

63
00:04:58,513 --> 00:05:01,209
- Who's the buyer?
- An ex-Company guy with a bone to pick.

64
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:02,742
Just like your father.

65
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:05,876
Michael?

66
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:08,311
I need to meet him first.

67
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:09,649
That could be arranged.

68
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:12,418
And just so you know,
this wasn't personal.

69
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:13,685
This was just business.

70
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:15,252
We'll be in touch.

71
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:36,211
We stick to the plan, all right?
We're gonna get Scylla.

72
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:40,184
We wait for Alex
to come through on his end, all right?

73
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:50,389
Hang on a second.

74
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:00,899
Hello, Alex.

75
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,938
You came.

76
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:05,271
I always do.

77
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:07,710
To the detriment of my pay grade.

78
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:12,918
These last few weeks, I've been part
of an operation...

79
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:15,612
...under the hand of Homeland Security.

80
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:18,157
Felicia, the people I'm working with...

81
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:21,386
...we're this close to the one thing
that can destroy the Company:

82
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:25,095
Their little black book. We can get it.
The names, numbers, operators.

83
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:28,429
I don't wanna get caught up
in some inter-agency politics.

84
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:31,294
- Lf this is Homeland...
- Homeland buried the operation.

85
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:32,837
We can't come back in.

86
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:36,433
We can still take the Company down.
So my question to you is:

87
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:39,136
Who do you know in the bureau
you can trust?

88
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:40,846
It used to be you, Alex.

89
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:48,181
I've lost a lot of things these last few
months, not the least of which is your trust.

90
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:50,153
But I don't come to you hat in hand.

91
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:52,349
Scylla is real.

92
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:56,792
Now, if you don't want anything to do
with it, that's all right. I can walk away.

93
00:07:01,535 --> 00:07:05,164
Yeah, there is someone
who might be able to help.

94
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:12,676
Sir, there are over 10 million faces
in Los Angeles.

95
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:17,249
Even with NSA and CIA satellite linkups,
we're gonna be sifting through millions...

96
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:18,817
...of gigabytes of image data.

97
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:22,387
The chances of finding Don Self
and Scofield and Burrows, it's not good.

98
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:23,989
Well, let's improve the odds.

99
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:26,353
Self and the brothers
may have stolen Scylla...

100
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:29,724
...but none of them have the connections
to offload it.

101
00:07:29,897 --> 00:07:32,388
Add Gretchen's face to the search.

102
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:37,333
She won't be welcome in Scofield's camp
so connect her image with Self's.

103
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:41,566
We find those two within five feet
of each other anywhere in Los Angeles...

104
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:43,334
...and we've found Scylla.

105
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,580
Are you friends
with my Auntie Gretchen?

106
00:07:58,092 --> 00:08:00,322
Go play in your room.
Mommy will be in soon.

107
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:10,029
Where's her daddy?

108
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,567
Gretchen doesn't talk about him.

109
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:18,803
So Emily doesn't know that you ain't?
That Gretchen's her momma?

110
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:21,675
No. And I'd like to keep it that way.

111
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:31,381
Cute girl.

112
00:08:35,162 --> 00:08:36,390
Don't hurt my little girl.

113
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:40,093
If you have to do something, do it to me.

114
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,728
What do you think I am, a monster?

115
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:49,535
You're holding us prisoner
in our own home.

116
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:53,345
I'm just as much as a prisoner as you.

117
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:58,782
Eggshell white.

118
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:00,716
Bold lettering. Double embossed.

119
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:02,480
I was Cole Pfeiffer.

120
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:03,987
Respected businessman.

121
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:06,126
Top salesman in the northeast region.

122
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:13,156
And now I'm back being prisoner
of my own identity.

123
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,330
Theodore Bagwell.

124
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:17,232
Convict.

125
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:22,175
To hell with it.

126
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:24,235
We are who we are, right?

127
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:29,108
What were you selling?

128
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:31,251
Never you mind.

129
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:33,780
You just pray your sister comes through.

130
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:39,085
The Company gets destroyed
and we get paid. Great deal.

131
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,956
This guy is just another General Krantz
waiting to happen.

132
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:44,097
Let's say we sell it
and the Company burns.

133
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:45,323
You know what happens?

134
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:48,957
Another company
is built right on top of that one.

135
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:51,428
We're not selling.

136
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:05,182
Sucre pulled it off.

137
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,477
Great.

138
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:26,997
Is this gonna work?

139
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:30,200
It's like an ultrasound.
It can see through everything.

140
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,556
You're building up a tolerance.

141
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:49,696
Then we'll up the dosage.

142
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:52,196
Yeah, I have, and at this point,
a higher dosage...

143
00:10:52,366 --> 00:10:54,493
...would have more side effects
than the tumor.

144
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:57,000
Then I'll manage without it.

145
00:10:57,705 --> 00:11:00,196
Sit this one out.
Let me and Sucre handle it.

146
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:01,932
I'm going.

147
00:11:10,217 --> 00:11:12,378
Why can't he understand
I need to finish this?

148
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:16,350
Everything that happened,
it all started with the Company.

149
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:18,457
Maybe not for Lincoln.

150
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:23,159
Maybe for him, this all started with his
little brother breaking him out of prison.

151
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,059
Michael, you saved his life.

152
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:29,396
If anything happens to you, he spends
the rest of his life feeling guilty for that.

153
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:33,931
Tell me something, at what point
does a noble deed become fanaticism?

154
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:36,941
Fanaticism is the only way to beat them.

155
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:38,476
Even if it kills you?

156
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:54,889
Hey, pop the trunk.

157
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:37,627
Michael?

158
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:42,608
Sucre just sent a text.
He's found Gretchen and Self.

159
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:44,505
Good. Good.

160
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:47,773
- You all right?
- Yeah, for now.

161
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:49,506
All right.

162
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:51,810
- Linc?
- Yeah?

163
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,348
After your trial,
the day I came to see you at Fox River.

164
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:58,354
What about it?

165
00:12:58,659 --> 00:12:59,785
I thought you did it.

166
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:04,124
I thought you killed Terrence Steadman.

167
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:06,562
Along with everyone else.

168
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:09,061
But by the time I left...

169
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,999
...I knew you were innocent.

170
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:14,901
And I had to get you out of that place.

171
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:17,805
So however this plays out...

172
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:20,705
...I have no regrets.

173
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:10,453
Scofield's hiding something
in the washroom.

174
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:13,259
I think we just found our piece of Scylla.
Call Vikan.

175
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:15,061
I wanna talk to my daughter first.

176
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:17,533
Just call him, okay. They're fine.

177
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:19,433
I have a history with Vikan.

178
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:22,541
No money exchanges hands
unless I tell him you're legit.

179
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,643
I wanna talk to my daughter now.

180
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:38,387
- Yeah?
- Put the daughter on the phone.

181
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:41,326
- Is there a problem?
- Just put her on the phone.

182
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:47,628
- Hello?
- Emily, baby, it's your Auntie Gretchen.

183
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:48,995
<i>Where are you?</i>

184
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:51,069
I'm not far. Are you okay?

185
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:54,497
There's this mean man here.

186
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:02,404
Emily, do you remember the mean man
that used to live with your Mommy Rita?

187
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,778
<i>- The one that used to yell at you?
- Roy?</i>

188
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:07,216
<i>That's the one.
And what happened to Roy?</i>

189
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:11,756
He went to the store one day
and never came back.

190
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:13,358
<i>That's right.</i>

191
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:16,724
And I think
that if you don't like this mean man...

192
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:21,766
...then very soon, he's gonna leave
and he's never coming back.

193
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:23,664
You think so?

194
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:26,271
- Baby, I know so.
- All right. That's enough.

195
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,840
Emily, baby, put the mean man
back on the phone.

196
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:36,647
Listen to me. I'm gonna call you in two
hours with the location of the exchange.

197
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:38,876
If you don't hear from me, kill them both.

198
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:55,701
You expecting somebody?

199
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:57,336
No.

200
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:07,176
Look lively.

201
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:10,481
Buttercup, why don't you go play
with your dolls or something?

202
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:12,744
It's okay, honey. Go to your playroom.

203
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:21,785
Hi there. My name is Ralph Becker.

204
00:16:21,962 --> 00:16:25,329
And I'm selling Bibles to raise money
for the Church of the Holy Trinity.

205
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:29,629
I wonder if I could spend five minutes
of your time and talk about the Gospel.

206
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:33,004
We're a bit indisposed at the moment,
Ralph.

207
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:34,435
Can you come back tomorrow?

208
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:37,577
Well, actually, today is the last day
of the fundraiser.

209
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:39,177
I said we're busy.

210
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:41,109
Well, never too busy for God.

211
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:45,209
And what's a few minutes of your afternoon
for a place in his kingdom?

212
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:49,222
You're a big pushy for a Bible salesman,
ain't you, friend?

213
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:51,348
I'm on a mission.

214
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:55,386
Yeah, I'll bet you're on a mission, right.

215
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:59,498
- What are you doing?
- Close the door.

216
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,758
This guy is Company.

217
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:02,458
- What's Company?
- Get me rope.

218
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:05,434
- This guy is a Bible salesman.
- Give me the rope now.

219
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:38,437
Good choice for a meeting spot, Alex.

220
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:41,096
Crowded place, a few exits.

221
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:43,971
A corner table
with a full view of the room.

222
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:47,204
Looks like you're getting acclimated
to life on the run.

223
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:51,610
I hear you got promoted.

224
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:53,817
Your own field office.

225
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,316
That's impressive.

226
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,618
When you're neither a disgrace
to the bureau nor a drug addict...

227
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:00,817
...good things happen.

228
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:02,757
- He's clean, Mark.
- Thank you, Felicia.

229
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:04,760
Oh, look, I know you, Mark.

230
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:06,523
You're a good agent. Ambitious.

231
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,601
Let me appeal to the side
that likes to see your name in print.

232
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,671
You wanna be on a shortlist
for deputy director, huh?

233
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,208
Right. Lang filled me in.

234
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,707
You've got solid gold intel.

235
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:20,938
But I don't know if I'm more skeptical
of a burned out ex-fed...

236
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:23,878
...or the mythical cabal
known as the Company.

237
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:27,149
You came all the way here for a myth?

238
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:31,485
What do you want, Alex?

239
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:34,627
Felicia tells me you have
the attorney general's ear.

240
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,319
That's right.

241
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:39,656
The bureau is compromised.

242
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,165
Homeland Security is compromised.

243
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:43,598
I need someone I can trust.

244
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,998
Can I trust you?

245
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:55,979
You get me credible intelligence
against the Company...

246
00:18:57,017 --> 00:19:00,612
...l'll walk you into
the attorney general's office myself.

247
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,680
You'll get it.

248
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:20,670
Alex, talk to me.

249
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:23,002
I found someone in government
we can trust.

250
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:26,441
- How close are you to getting Scylla?
- Very.

251
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:29,844
Michael, we're in escrow here.
You gotta come through with the house.

252
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:32,876
Don't worry. We're getting Scylla.

253
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:35,520
All right.

254
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:38,357
Look what I found.

255
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,818
But we have no way to shoot them.

256
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:49,291
Yeah, we do.

257
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:52,597
But I need you to buy some hairspray
and a lighter.

258
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:10,485
What's this?

259
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:12,156
My resignation.

260
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:19,155
Lisa, I tried to shield you from everything
I didn't think you could handle.

261
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:22,927
The only thing you shielded me from
was knowing who you really are.

262
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:25,968
Now I know.

263
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:29,901
I wanted a son.

264
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:33,303
Sir...

265
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:36,680
...taken less than an hour ago.

266
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,910
You were right. Gretchen's with Self.

267
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:47,520
Your mission
is the safe retrieval of Scylla.

268
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:50,925
- What are the rules of engagement?
- There are none. Shoot on sight.

269
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:53,497
Fauntleroy Hotel. Downtown.

270
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:07,808
Who sent you?

271
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:09,448
The Church of the Holy Trinity.

272
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:10,810
Liar.

273
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:14,147
Are you out of your mind?
You're beating up a Bible salesman.

274
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:15,345
I ain't Scofield.

275
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:17,990
I ain't Burrows. This ain't my lot.
Leave me alone.

276
00:21:18,158 --> 00:21:20,285
I'm not a part of this Company.

277
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,793
- I don't know anything, I swear.
- Look at him. Please, just look at him.

278
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:26,831
Does he look like some kind
of an undercover agent to you?

279
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,161
They blend in. That's how they get you.

280
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:31,065
Look at this, okay? His wallet, okay?

281
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:33,365
He's got a driver's license. Ralph Becker.

282
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,701
He's got a library card and a prayer card.

283
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:38,037
- That is pretty convincing.
- Look at this.

284
00:21:38,211 --> 00:21:41,840
Freedom, honor, country. Southeastern
Military Academy. Class of '98.

285
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:45,644
How many Bible salesman you know
graduate from a military academy?

286
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,548
No, I didn't go to Southeastern.

287
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:49,712
It's my kid brother's ring.

288
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,188
He died in Baghdad last year.

289
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,418
It was a car bomb.

290
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:57,085
I swear.

291
00:21:57,264 --> 00:21:58,925
Listen to me.

292
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:01,891
- Please.
- That made sense.

293
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:03,594
Can we?

294
00:22:03,904 --> 00:22:07,362
- That made sense.
- Please.

295
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:14,774
We're not going nowhere!

296
00:22:15,215 --> 00:22:16,842
Not till I get a phone call.

297
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:29,027
It's 25 for the hour.

298
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:32,765
- We don't need a room.
- I'm looking for my sister.

299
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:35,493
Her name is Gretchen Morgan.
Tell me what room she's in.

300
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:38,035
You want information, call 411.

301
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,639
How about now?

302
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:49,840
No Gretchen Morgan.

303
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:51,614
No refund.

304
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:55,383
She's about 5'7.
She's got black hair and blue eyes.

305
00:22:55,555 --> 00:22:58,649
I imagine she'd stand out
in a fine establishment like this one.

306
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:09,724
- Room 308.
- Thank you so much.

307
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:15,807
No urinating in the stairwell.

308
00:23:15,976 --> 00:23:17,409
That's the golden rule.

309
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:23,842
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they're on the third floor...

310
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:26,850
...front of the hotel,
just to the left of center.

311
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:29,618
<i>- Got it. Thanks.
- Yeah.</i>

312
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:31,689
Third floor up, just left of the balcony.

313
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:37,959
Why don't you set up
on that rooftop over there?

314
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:45,631
Scylla's almost complete.
Is everything ready?

315
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:48,501
- Let me talk to Gretchen.
- No, no. You're talking to me.

316
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:51,100
The buyer has touched down.

317
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:53,108
This isn't the person you keep waiting.

318
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,042
Likewise.
Make sure he has the money.

319
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:56,443
Listen to me, you mook.

320
00:23:56,616 --> 00:24:00,211
You're in the deep end of the pool now.
At least act like you can swim.

321
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:03,185
- Next time I call I wanna talk to Gretchen.
- Listen to me.

322
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:06,257
The next time you call,
tell me that the money's ready.

323
00:24:06,426 --> 00:24:08,087
You understand?

324
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:13,631
- Hello?
- I thought you should know...

325
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,291
...a man and a woman came in
looking for you.

326
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:17,527
Scofield found us.

327
00:24:17,704 --> 00:24:19,137
- How?
- Who cares? Get ready.

328
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:21,637
- How long ago?
- A couple of minutes.

329
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:31,014
I don't want no trouble in my place.

330
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:22,998
I'm gonna recon the hallway.
Anything goes down...

331
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:25,797
...get Scylla, get out. I will find you.
- Okay.

332
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:35,894
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

333
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:28,377
Like I said before, this is just business.

334
00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:33,148
Don't move!

335
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:35,621
Get in.

336
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,804
Help me get him in the back of the van.

337
00:29:03,189 --> 00:29:04,486
Michael!

338
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:22,465
What is that?

339
00:29:22,642 --> 00:29:24,701
It's the warehouse.

340
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:27,204
The chip.

341
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:37,854
- You sure it's here?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

342
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:41,221
From the schematic,
it can only be in one place.

343
00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:08,677
Look, don't be stupid, okay, Gretchen?

344
00:30:08,855 --> 00:30:11,915
You're gonna get your daughter back
and your money.

345
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:15,152
I'll see you in the car.

346
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,273
He was brought in like this.

347
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:33,707
Who's there?

348
00:30:35,615 --> 00:30:39,244
I'm giving him 10 cc's of clonazepam
and taking him downstairs.

349
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,011
We'll know more soon.

350
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,251
Try and relax.

351
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:18,284
Don't worry.
We're gonna get Michael back.

352
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:21,427
How? Self took the piece.
We got nothing to trade for Michael.

353
00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:23,061
He's sick, Lincoln.

354
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:25,663
If they haven't killed him already.

355
00:31:25,832 --> 00:31:27,891
We'll get him back I promise.

356
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:33,363
Hello?

357
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,839
Hold on.

358
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:37,475
It's Alex.

359
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:41,338
- Yeah.
- Did you get it yet?

360
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:44,846
No. Self's got it. All of it.

361
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,315
- What?
- Just forget about Scylla.

362
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:50,786
The Company's taken Michael.

363
00:31:51,424 --> 00:31:54,416
<i>Your friend in government,
can he do anything for him?</i>

364
00:31:54,994 --> 00:31:56,018
No, I don't think so.

365
00:31:58,664 --> 00:32:01,258
There's no reason for you
to come back, Alex.

366
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:03,492
I'm sorry.

367
00:32:05,171 --> 00:32:06,968
Yeah, me too.

368
00:32:18,151 --> 00:32:19,175
I should have known.

369
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,414
Vikan's meeting us here?

370
00:33:26,586 --> 00:33:29,453
We'll be off
of the Company's radar here.

371
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:35,251
- Yeah?
- We've got a problem.

372
00:33:35,428 --> 00:33:37,521
It can wait.
We're in the homestretch here.

373
00:33:37,697 --> 00:33:41,258
Grab the sister and the girl.
I'm gonna call you back with the location.

374
00:33:41,434 --> 00:33:46,599
I'd love to but a third party
has been introduced into the mix.

375
00:33:46,772 --> 00:33:48,034
<i>Who?</i>

376
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:49,401
I'm not sure yet.

377
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:53,067
- He might be a Company operative.
- So kill him.

378
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:55,809
He could also be a Bible salesman.

379
00:33:55,982 --> 00:33:59,679
Then he should have no problem
getting past Saint Peter. Kill him.

380
00:34:05,358 --> 00:34:07,121
Go in the playroom with your daughter.

381
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:09,158
- What are you gonna do?
- Go, now!

382
00:34:18,137 --> 00:34:20,230
Please, please, please don't kill me.

383
00:34:20,973 --> 00:34:22,031
Please don't kill me.

384
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,800
Please. Look, I won't tell anyone.

385
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:27,309
I won't tell anyone. I promise.
Please don't kill me.

386
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,744
I swear I won't tell anyone.

387
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:35,113
- Don't do this.
- I told you to go back yonder. Okay?

388
00:34:35,288 --> 00:34:36,983
You don't wanna see this.

389
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:40,849
Cole Pfeiffer wouldn't do this.

390
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:43,253
Cole Pfeiffer ain't here no more.

391
00:34:43,729 --> 00:34:45,287
Just old T-Bag.

392
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:48,763
Our Father, who art in heaven.

393
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:50,333
Hallowed be thy name.

394
00:34:50,503 --> 00:34:52,437
You wanna be free?

395
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:55,766
Start now. Right this minute.

396
00:34:56,942 --> 00:35:00,275
If you pull that trigger,
Cole Pfeiffer's gone forever.

397
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:03,648
Don't do this.

398
00:35:07,486 --> 00:35:09,249
Don't do it.

399
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:19,028
You know my daddy
was a religious man too, Ralph.

400
00:35:19,198 --> 00:35:20,358
Just like you.

401
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,194
We used to pray together
in my room at night.

402
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:29,707
And I used to lie on the floor crying
just like you now.

403
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:34,642
When I couldn't take it no more...

404
00:35:34,814 --> 00:35:39,410
...my daddy would recite a particular piece
of scripture that he was fond of.

405
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:44,287
Weeping may endure through the night.

406
00:35:44,457 --> 00:35:47,449
Or joy cometh in the morning.

407
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:49,856
Psalms 35.

408
00:36:24,263 --> 00:36:26,197
- Rita.
- Yeah?

409
00:36:26,365 --> 00:36:28,356
Have you got a car?

410
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:31,435
My car is in the... It's in the garage.

411
00:36:31,604 --> 00:36:36,200
You get in that car right now and you drive
far, far away from here, right now, okay?

412
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:37,933
Here.

413
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,873
Take this.

414
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:44,072
Rita?

415
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:47,543
Thank you.

416
00:36:52,425 --> 00:36:54,120
What are you gonna do to me?

417
00:37:01,434 --> 00:37:03,095
I want you to go.

418
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:05,396
I want you to be free.

419
00:37:07,506 --> 00:37:08,734
Be as free as me.

420
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:11,572
Thank you.

421
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:14,510
Thank you so much.

422
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:31,655
Yeah, I got one.

423
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:33,162
Not Gretchen.

424
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:34,822
It's Bagwell.

425
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:36,798
I'm bringing him in.

426
00:37:41,507 --> 00:37:42,735
The growth is malignant.

427
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:46,605
It's pushing up against his temporal lobe.
It will kill him if it's not removed.

428
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:49,111
Have you seen anything like this before?

429
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:50,339
This advanced?

430
00:37:51,116 --> 00:37:52,447
Once.

431
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:54,676
Sir.

432
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:57,682
You'll never guess
who just came through the door.

433
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:07,325
I wanna see my brother.

434
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,178
Thank you, gentlemen.

435
00:38:20,379 --> 00:38:22,244
Mr. Burrows won't be a problem.

436
00:38:22,414 --> 00:38:23,745
Will you?

437
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,353
It started with me and ends with me.
Let Michael go.

438
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,415
I think you made the right decision.

439
00:38:34,193 --> 00:38:36,718
Let's go downstairs and see your brother.

440
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:01,043
Gretchen.

441
00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:03,448
Don.

442
00:39:03,622 --> 00:39:06,386
- This better be the real thing this time.
- It's all here.

443
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:09,960
Yeah, well, no offense,
but I'll check it myself.

444
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:16,798
So the buyer's on the way?

445
00:39:18,637 --> 00:39:21,037
He will be here shortly.

446
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:23,333
And he's bringing the money?

447
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:26,643
Yes, Don. He is bringing the money.

448
00:39:33,152 --> 00:39:35,586
Scylla is complete.

449
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:37,085
Gretchen...

450
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:38,746
...you did it.

451
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:44,487
What I wouldn't give to see the look
on the General's face.

452
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:48,398
What the hell are you doing?

453
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:51,559
- We need him alive to sell this thing.
- You heard what he said.

454
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:53,398
Buyer's already on the way.

455
00:39:53,572 --> 00:39:57,531
You think I'm gonna give this clown
30 percent for just making introductions?

456
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:05,182
Come on. How could you miss?
It's a glass door.

457
00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:07,012
Okay, right. I hear you.

458
00:40:07,186 --> 00:40:09,086
We'll be right out.

459
00:40:34,947 --> 00:40:36,539
Well?

460
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:41,347
The attorney general's willing
to hear you out.

461
00:40:44,323 --> 00:40:46,917
You know, from where I'm sitting,
it looked like...

462
00:40:47,092 --> 00:40:50,152
Your flight to Dallas leaves
in 45 minutes.

463
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:01,537
Can I trust this guy?

464
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,941
We better go.

465
00:41:25,364 --> 00:41:28,231
Come on, Alex.
It's a short trip to the airport.

466
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:32,162
The attorney general's waiting.

467
00:41:44,116 --> 00:41:47,210
There is no meeting
with the attorney general, is there?

468
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:06,598
Thank you, Felicia,
for everything you've done.

469
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:08,464
Everything.

470
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:23,586
- What did you do to my brother?
- Michael needs an operation...

471
00:42:23,756 --> 00:42:25,747
...to remove a tumor
from his temporal lobe.

472
00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:27,414
And he needs it now.

473
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:32,121
The Company can provide
such an operation at a cost.

474
00:42:32,464 --> 00:42:33,624
What do you want from us?

475
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:36,666
Not us, Lincoln, you.

476
00:42:37,136 --> 00:42:39,969
The price of the operation
is the safe return of Scylla.

477
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:42,937
If you bring back to me what you stole...

478
00:42:43,108 --> 00:42:47,272
...then I will make sure Michael
gets the finest medical care in the world.

479
00:42:47,446 --> 00:42:49,971
The Company
has science and technology...

480
00:42:50,149 --> 00:42:52,947
...that's years ahead of anything
available to the public.

481
00:42:53,118 --> 00:42:55,609
And it's all right here. In this facility.

482
00:42:56,255 --> 00:43:02,125
Now, I would imagine that working for me
will be difficult for you to accept.

483
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:05,153
What's this?

484
00:43:05,697 --> 00:43:07,824
Added incentive.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
