00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,512
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:03,818 --> 00:00:05,683
- The Company's moving Scylla.
- When?

3
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:07,343
- Tomorrow.
- I messed up.

4
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:09,456
- What do you mean?
- I mentioned Whistler.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,587
Hello? Hello?

6
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:16,221
So you're Feng?

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,826
- Susan?
- That's right.

8
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:23,060
The wall itself is fortified with steal fiber.

9
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:27,037
The bad news is that there are both weight
and microphonic sensors...

10
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:30,837
...that will alert Company security
to the presence of any human being...

11
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:32,604
...that weighs more than 2 pounds.

12
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:34,205
Michael.

13
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:36,145
You have a hypothalamus hamartoma.

14
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:38,285
And the doctor feels
that you need surgery.

15
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:40,444
- Two days.
- No. Tomorrow.

16
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:43,647
Otherwise, you could die,
and there's no alternative.

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,587
Just a little bit more. Go slow.

18
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:11,541
You know, there's no way
he deserves any of this.

19
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:13,907
- Sing it, sister.
- After what he put me through.

20
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:15,673
I can hardly believe it myself.

21
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,184
Look, what we must do is make sure
that cosmic justice rains down upon him.

22
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:22,515
But once we obtain
the good general's card...

23
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,525
...there ain't hardly nothing standing in
between us and Mr. Feng's $ 125 million.

24
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:34,891
I was born on a mountainside.

25
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:36,932
Just keep both hands on the camera.

26
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,097
Let's go.

27
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:49,482
Oh, yeah.

28
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:56,018
That's great. Okay.
Thank you so much, Dr. Malden.

29
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,886
- Yeah. He can see you today at 3.
- No.

30
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,223
- You're going.
- We need to finish what we started.

31
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,124
- We can do this.
- I need one more day.

32
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:10,264
Michael, Dr. Malden can see you today.

33
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:12,702
He's given us his word
he won't alert authorities.

34
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:16,866
If you put this off and you collapse,
you're gonna be treated by another doctor.

35
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:20,912
Do you wanna roll the dice
that they're not gonna call the cops?

36
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:23,414
There's still so much to do.

37
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:35,719
All right.

38
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:38,491
Three o'clock?

39
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:45,068
Last time I drill a hole in the wall...

40
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:48,933
...was with an egg beater
back in Fox River with Michael.

41
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,477
I just can't believe
it's all coming to an end.

42
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:54,510
And he's not here.

43
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:56,282
He'll be all right.

44
00:03:57,418 --> 00:03:59,113
How do you know?

45
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:01,821
I don't.

46
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:04,557
I'm just trying to keep us focused.

47
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:06,793
Hey...

48
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:08,426
...he's sick.

49
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:11,292
But I guarantee you,
one thing that'll make him worse...

50
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:13,524
...going back to jail.

51
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:18,768
Yeah, if we don't get in there...

52
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:21,666
...that's where we're all going.

53
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:17,526
He's gonna be okay.

54
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,528
I'm scared too. But a hospital's
the best place for him right now.

55
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,866
He won't go without a plan
to complete the job.

56
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:27,998
Well...

57
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:32,173
...Alex and Fernando should be back soon
with the video, right?

58
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:33,370
Should be, yeah.

59
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:36,879
So then all we need is the sixth card.

60
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:39,076
Gretchen's working on that.

61
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:42,620
- You really think we can trust her?
- With the card?

62
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:44,422
Absolutely.

63
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:46,059
Anything else?

64
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:47,524
Nope.

65
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:57,133
Eight guards will accompany Scylla
from the bunker up to the garage...

66
00:05:57,304 --> 00:05:58,828
...where a truck will be waiting.

67
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:01,406
One truck is not going to be
enough security.

68
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:05,238
That is why I have a full Secret Service
escort to March Air Force Base.

69
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:07,313
There, it will be brought aboard a C-130.

70
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:09,574
We need air support
all the way to River Rock.

71
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,241
Colonel Rififi is lending us
three of his F-18's.

72
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:15,614
It may be hard for you to believe,
but I do have this under control.

73
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,054
There's nothing for you to worry about.

74
00:06:20,227 --> 00:06:23,663
When the plane lands,
the same precautions will be taken.

75
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:27,289
Armored truck to guards to final location.

76
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,663
That's fine.

77
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:38,611
- Are you going somewhere?
- I have an appointment.

78
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:40,173
Today?

79
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:42,872
You told me
there was nothing to worry about.

80
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:46,319
Just tell me it's not Gretchen.

81
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:50,416
- This is ridiculous.
- It's personal. I'm not going to discuss it.

82
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:53,025
- I don't trust her.
- That's nothing new.

83
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,989
I'll be back in an hour.

84
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:04,938
What'd you find out?

85
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:06,766
You'll be awake the whole time.

86
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:09,739
The only anesthetic you're gonna need
is minor injections...

87
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,107
...local, two in your forehead
and two in the back of your head.

88
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,976
- And that's for the brace?
- The frame, yeah.

89
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,642
And attaching that
is gonna be the most uncomfortable part.

90
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,618
They're gonna have to secure four pins
into your skull...

91
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,224
...and they're gonna need a small drill
to do it.

92
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:28,357
- Do we have to listen to this?
- I wanna hear this, Linc.

93
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:30,190
And then what?

94
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:33,595
Another CT scan. The doctor will use
the three-dimensional imagery...

95
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,997
...to pinpoint the exact location
of the growth.

96
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:37,295
And once you have that?

97
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:40,802
Then it's the gamma knife unit.
They'll fit you with a helmet.

98
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:44,035
They'll calibrate it
so that each of the 201 holes...

99
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:47,874
...are aimed directly for the tumor,
and at that point, it's just a matter of...

100
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:51,711
I got two more boxes in the car
that you guys gotta bring in yourself.

101
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:56,020
All right.

102
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,384
You okay?

103
00:07:57,558 --> 00:08:01,153
- Because the last time I saw you...
- I'm fine. I was just a little dehydrated.

104
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:04,229
All right, good.
This is the stuff you requested.

105
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:05,797
Sure this is gonna get you in?

106
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:09,163
Let us worry about getting in.
You worry about how we're getting out.

107
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:11,099
I got someone on Gretchen and Bagwell.

108
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:13,570
If they try anything,
they're getting taken out.

109
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:16,437
Nothing's gonna get between us
and Scylla.

110
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,608
You sure you're all right?

111
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:25,509
Yeah. It's just, you know, we're breaking
into Company headquarters...

112
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,088
...and you'll understand
why we're on edge.

113
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:30,080
Understood.

114
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:32,521
When your father approached me
about doing this...

115
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:35,719
...I felt like I was chasing a ghost
or something...

116
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:39,559
...but because of the work
you guys have done, today's the day.

117
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:42,201
We're gonna take these bastards down.

118
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,480
You got it?

119
00:08:57,651 --> 00:08:59,312
Got it.

120
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:03,447
We got four hours.

121
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:06,149
- How come?
- I'm going in for treatment.

122
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,057
There we go.

123
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:16,694
Scylla.

124
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:18,871
Obviously, we've got a lot to figure out.

125
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,597
- CONCRETE WALL -GLASS WALL
- WEIGHT SENSORS -DETECTORS

126
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:24,741
We have to break through two walls,
one concrete and one glass...

127
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:27,308
...and do it without making a sound.

128
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:31,315
Hypersensitive parabolic microphones
pointed in all directions.

129
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:37,117
Floor sensors can detect an added
surface load of just 2 pounds, so...

130
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:42,359
...we have to traverse the distance between
the walls without touching the floor.

131
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:46,795
We need to do all that without generating
any kind of body heat whatsoever.

132
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:50,926
Of course, they have the latest
in heat-sensing technology.

133
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:54,132
We make one wrong move...

134
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:57,501
...the camera goes on,
and General Krantz knows we're inside.

135
00:09:57,678 --> 00:10:01,978
It's amazing. All this security, and only
one man has access to video surveillance.

136
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:04,777
The Company doesn't want any record
of what's going on.

137
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:08,012
- Can we access that elevator?
- It's in the middle of the building.

138
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:11,715
There are 10 layers of security.
We have to go where they're not expecting.

139
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:15,191
Now, starting with the concrete wall,
you were drilling there, right?

140
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:17,557
Yes. Fortified with steal fibers,
like you said.

141
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,460
In order to get through that...

142
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:23,501
...we have to generate
an electromagnetic field.

143
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:30,510
We have to generate
an electromagnetic field.

144
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:38,242
To have an electromagnetic field
with the force that we want...

145
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:41,980
...we're gonna need at least a couple
of car batteries. Can you get that?

146
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:43,953
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,723
We can do this.

148
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:54,730
What time are we expecting Gretchen
to get that sixth card?

149
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:07,445
What took you so long?

150
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,508
You know how I get when I'm hungry.

151
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:13,382
It wasn't easy
getting away from the office.

152
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:18,355
I could have come to you,
like old times.

153
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:22,460
I almost wish
there was a mahogany desk in here.

154
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,732
You're tense.

155
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,100
Take off this jacket. Let me get in there.

156
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:43,146
I didn't bring it with me.

157
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:47,384
My card.
That is what you're looking for, right?

158
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:50,415
- What are you talking about, you're card?
- You forget...

159
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,151
...l'm the one that taught you how to lie.

160
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:58,120
I never thought that at the age of 63...

161
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:00,266
...I could still have my heart broken.

162
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:03,726
Why'd you feel you needed
to steal my card?

163
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:08,341
Don't you know that if you'd waited a little
bit longer, you'd have had one of your own?

164
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:09,737
I'm sorry. I'm...

165
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:13,273
- Who are you selling it to?
- That's not why...

166
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:14,846
Who?

167
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:18,480
I'm the mother of your child.

168
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:21,646
Please, for Emily's sake.

169
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,958
Please, Jonathan. Please.

170
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:27,920
I love you.

171
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:39,637
If I ever see you again...

172
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,370
...l'll shoot you on sight.

173
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:00,454
Is everything all right, Cole?

174
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:02,686
I got something important
you need to know.

175
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:06,023
We're gonna be rich.

176
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:10,263
So here's the question:

177
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:14,533
How much is it gonna cost me
to get that jacket off of you?

178
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,768
- Excuse me?
- Last day I'm ever gonna see you.

179
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:19,572
You're all covered up.

180
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:22,146
I cannot abide. One hundred dollars.

181
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:24,477
You wanna pay me
to take my clothes off?

182
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:27,142
Not all of them, just the jacket.
Two hundred?

183
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:30,179
- I'm not gonna strip for you.
- Pity an old man.

184
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:34,224
- You're disgusting.
- And lecherous and vile.

185
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:36,385
And soon to be wealthy
beyond belief.

186
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:37,860
One thousand dollars.

187
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,157
Why so modest all of a sudden?

188
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:44,793
Cole, I need to see you in my office,
now.

189
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:52,103
Thank you for calling Gate.
How can I help you?

190
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,448
It was Mr. White in his office
with the lead stapler.

191
00:13:57,618 --> 00:14:03,352
Cole, yesterday with that Idaho group,
you made this company $35,000.

192
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:08,423
And I would like to return the favor.

193
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:12,562
It's our annual cruise.

194
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:15,827
Seven days and six nights
of nonstop pitching.

195
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:18,631
I personally clear $50,000 on most trips.

196
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:22,400
But for everything you've done...

197
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,442
...it's all yours. The least I could do.

198
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,106
It leaves today.

199
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:30,982
Go home and pack.
I'll see you in a week.

200
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:38,390
Unfortunately, I have some business
I need to take care of right here.

201
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:50,662
Okay. So this is how it works.

202
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:54,534
As soon as the sensors pick up any kind
of a heat source, 90 degrees or more...

203
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,575
...system goes into standby.
A yellow light comes on.

204
00:14:57,744 --> 00:15:01,111
After five seconds, if the heat source
isn't gone, we have an alarm.

205
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:05,007
We got six seconds to make it across
the hallway and through the glass wall?

206
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:08,086
- Basically.
- Lf we get our hands on liquid nitrogen...

207
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:10,280
...we could regulate the temperature.

208
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:11,856
Yeah.

209
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:14,360
Kill two birds with one stone.

210
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:16,655
See if you can get some of that.

211
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:30,575
Hey.

212
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:32,901
Hey.

213
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:37,682
I'm not gonna ask you how you feel.

214
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:39,985
Good.

215
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:43,279
About four years
after I joined the bureau...

216
00:15:43,991 --> 00:15:47,688
...my first special agent in charge,
he was diagnosed with liver cancer.

217
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:52,324
But for him, the hardest part
wasn't the treatment. The hardest part...

218
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:55,468
...was leaving the office,
because we had this big RICO case...

219
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:57,660
...that was about to go to trial.

220
00:15:57,838 --> 00:16:02,468
And we're talking thousands of man-hours
and five years of research...

221
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:05,770
...and the guy was gonna be in chemo.

222
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,214
And he was scared.

223
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:11,976
He was scared
we were gonna lose the case...

224
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:14,017
...and a lot of bad men were gonna walk.

225
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:18,920
Let me guess. He had a ragtag band
of criminals ready to pick up the slack.

226
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:24,490
Yeah, something like that.

227
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:32,304
We're not gonna let you down, Michael.

228
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:38,841
What happened to your boss?

229
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,078
Oh, he was there to see us win.

230
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:53,951
You sure she's a fed?

231
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:57,563
Wouldn't take off her jacket for $ 1000.
She's got a gun under there.

232
00:16:57,731 --> 00:16:58,959
It's a complication.

233
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:00,861
Well, that's a nice way to put it.

234
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:04,470
Like you not getting the sixth card.
What are we calling that, a setback?

235
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:06,037
Relax.

236
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,608
You have any idea
what I've giving up here?

237
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:11,141
I was guaranteed 50 grand.

238
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:13,472
You're crying over $50,000?
Are you serious?

239
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:17,481
I have a job. I make money.
I get mail. People call me "sir."

240
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:20,051
Working 12-hour days
and eating leftover lo mein.

241
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,155
Something tells me Bagwell
wouldn't last long in this situation.

242
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:25,450
Yeah, maybe.

243
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:28,219
But Cole Pfeiffer would.

244
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:32,058
You wanna pout? You do it tomorrow.
We have work to do.

245
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:38,631
- Is it really worth $ 125 million?
- It's worth twice as much.

246
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:43,504
- What if they refuse to hand it over?
- Either we pay for Scylla or we kill for it.

247
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,481
- Susan.
- Feng.

248
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:00,353
We need to talk.

249
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:10,328
Hey, give me a second here, guys.
Just a second.

250
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:14,935
We can't make any noise
above 10 decibels.

251
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:18,043
- You got two of those?
- Absolutely.

252
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:20,645
This is gonna work, right?

253
00:18:20,814 --> 00:18:24,272
- It should.
- No, not just that.

254
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:25,918
The whole thing.

255
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:28,611
I mean, do we even have a chance?

256
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:31,348
Just make sure the hole
is in the right place.

257
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,365
So where are we?

258
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:44,029
Gretchen didn't get us the sixth card.

259
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:47,500
- We need that sixth card, Don.
- I know.

260
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:49,969
We don't get the card,
we never crack Scylla.

261
00:18:50,143 --> 00:18:51,167
I know it.

262
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:55,243
So, what else do we know?
What else do we know?

263
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:57,243
We know they're moving Scylla today.

264
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:00,215
We can't waltz into the general's office
and steal that card.

265
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:02,116
So where does that leave us?

266
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:05,588
- There has to be a way.
- Not without losing another man.

267
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:08,627
I spent the week
trying to figure out how to get that.

268
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:12,424
Every scenario ends with a gun
to someone's head. That is not acceptable.

269
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:20,395
You know, Gretchen did pass
on this one piece of information for you.

270
00:19:20,574 --> 00:19:22,405
This could be helpful.

271
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:31,878
Hello?

272
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:36,211
The buyer just showed up.

273
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:38,687
<i>All right, well,
find out what they're up to.</i>

274
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,052
Mr. Feng, so glad you could come
and see us.

275
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:47,856
I was expecting the next time the three
of us would be in the same room together...

276
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:50,400
...that you'd have something for me.

277
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:54,706
That was our expectation as well,
but we've hit a few bumps in the road.

278
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,776
Now, to ensure
the item's safe recovery...

279
00:19:58,945 --> 00:19:59,969
...we need your help.

280
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:22,262
It's time to go.

281
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:29,030
All that avails is flight.

282
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,807
Maybe my father was on to something.

283
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,548
If they all die because we tried
to take down the Company...

284
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:37,580
...and I survive...

285
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:40,475
...because I called in sick...

286
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:44,422
...how am I gonna live with myself?

287
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:57,493
- You're gonna get through this.
- I'm not going to the hospital.

288
00:20:58,305 --> 00:20:59,329
What?

289
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:03,302
Linc, just get in the car.

290
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:05,535
I'm going with you.

291
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,032
If I still had a medical license,
I'd lose it over this.

292
00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:36,503
This is usually given to epileptics.

293
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:40,635
It will suppress the rapid firing of neurons
for the next three hours...

294
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:43,783
...making it unlikely
that you'll have a seizure in that time.

295
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,181
But, Michael,
any added mental or physical stress...

296
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:49,646
- I get it.
- I mean it.

297
00:21:49,823 --> 00:21:52,348
I don't want you to move
unless you absolutely have to.

298
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:55,759
And as soon as this is over,
I'm taking you to the hospital.

299
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,532
Hey.

300
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:11,305
You all right?

301
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:16,010
This is gonna go exactly as planned.

302
00:22:16,182 --> 00:22:17,615
I promise.

303
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:21,252
I'm not praying for me.

304
00:22:24,357 --> 00:22:25,881
Let's go.

305
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:29,161
You wanted to see me.

306
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:31,126
It's the second Tuesday of the month.

307
00:22:31,297 --> 00:22:33,663
Don't you have
your Eagles and Angels luncheon?

308
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,391
I figured I'd skip it today.

309
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,065
You called me in here
to confirm my lunch plans?

310
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:42,572
You were right.

311
00:22:43,243 --> 00:22:46,007
If it weren't for you,
this would be in the wind.

312
00:22:49,282 --> 00:22:50,306
Is she dead?

313
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:53,782
Let's just say she won't bother
either of us anymore.

314
00:22:54,354 --> 00:22:56,822
But I do want Scylla moved right now.

315
00:22:57,824 --> 00:23:00,292
Mechanics are on the tarmac
inspecting the C-130.

316
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,621
When they sign off,
we'll be ready to move.

317
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:05,128
Call the other cardholders.
Get them in here.

318
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:18,236
Did Self call you regarding the little snafu
with the general?

319
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,007
Get out of my way.

320
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:26,085
Just for clarification's sake, the sixth card
is part of the to-do list, right, gentlemen?

321
00:23:50,543 --> 00:23:51,840
The game's afoot.

322
00:23:52,145 --> 00:23:53,976
<i>Does Michael have a way
to get the card?</i>

323
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:58,917
I've worked with Michael before,
both with him and against him.

324
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:02,316
There's no way he's going down there
without a plan to finish the job.

325
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:04,923
I got a call from a friend.
Heard Scylla was in play.

326
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:07,525
He wants to know if he can get in on it.

327
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:13,159
<i>- A bidding war?
- He's prepared to offer 200.</i>

328
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:16,267
- Is he for real?
- I don't know.

329
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:19,337
I've set up a safe house where we can
hear him out. Have a pen?

330
00:24:19,506 --> 00:24:20,666
Just a minute.

331
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,375
<i>1917 Piermont.</i>

332
00:24:25,745 --> 00:24:30,205
1-9-1-7 Piermont.
Got it. I'm on my way.

333
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:35,713
Good afternoon.
Thank you for calling GATE.

334
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:39,825
I got some last-minute negotiations
with the buyer to speak about.

335
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:42,689
- I'll be back lickety-split.
- Okay. See you later.

336
00:24:42,862 --> 00:24:44,693
Can you hold, please?

337
00:25:18,164 --> 00:25:19,290
All right.

338
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,131
This is it.

339
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:27,603
Now, does anyone have any questions
about what they're supposed to do?

340
00:25:31,044 --> 00:25:33,808
The hole you drilled in the wall
this morning...

341
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,915
...once we get over there,
if we make too much noise...

342
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:41,613
...the sound waves will travel and get
picked up by the sensors on the other side.

343
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:45,246
So from this point on,
we need absolute silence.

344
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:51,659
Alex, good luck.

345
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:55,194
You too.

346
00:26:14,153 --> 00:26:15,711
You all ready?

347
00:26:18,424 --> 00:26:20,051
All right.

348
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,760
We have to break through two walls,
one concrete and one glass...

349
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:08,202
...and do it without making a sound.

350
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,687
In order to get through that, we have
to generate an electromagnetic field.

351
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:33,856
To have an electromagnetic field
with the force that we want...

352
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:37,002
...we're gonna need at least a couple
of car batteries.

353
00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:49,706
<i>Starting with the concrete wall,
you were drilling there, right?</i>

354
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:52,510
Yes. Fortified with steal fibers,
just like you said.

355
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:56,168
You sure this is it?

356
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:59,607
- 1917 Piermont Avenue.
- Okay.

357
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:01,845
When was the last time
you swept a room?

358
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:04,549
The academy.

359
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:09,183
Just follow my lead, because Gretchen
and Bagwell have no respect for human life.

360
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:11,619
- Okay? They go for a weapon, you shoot.
- Okay.

361
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,155
They try to run, you shoot.

362
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:15,589
They do anything than
kneel down, hands behind...

363
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:17,695
- I shoot.
- Don't miss.

364
00:35:57,903 --> 00:35:59,336
Agent Self.

365
00:36:01,674 --> 00:36:03,574
We've been waiting.

366
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:16,348
That's Feng. He's got them.

367
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:20,117
When Scofield and Burrows walk through,
give them an opportunity to surrender.

368
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:23,728
If we can avoid confrontation,
that's the best-case scenario.

369
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:26,659
There's no way they're gonna hand it over
without a fight.

370
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:28,925
If they take that position, we'll respond.

371
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:31,069
A hundred and twenty-five
million dollars.

372
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,971
Only cherry
that could top this sunny day.

373
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:40,010
You can keep your Burrows
and your Mahone and your Sucre.

374
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,840
Just leave Scofield for me.

375
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:53,320
We got a green light on the C-130.

376
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:55,458
It's time.

377
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,396
Okay, thank you.

378
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:25,635
Oren, Tuxhorn and Edison
are standing by.

379
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:27,237
Scuderi was in Las Vegas.

380
00:40:27,406 --> 00:40:30,842
You think we could get the state of Nevada
to outlaw gambling?

381
00:40:31,009 --> 00:40:33,136
I somehow doubt that.

382
00:40:33,312 --> 00:40:35,212
His plane will touch down
within an hour.

383
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,747
- Then you can make your lunch.
- I would rather stay.

384
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:42,819
Now, more than ever,
we need the support of law enforcement.

385
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:45,388
I will call you
when we're ready to move.

386
00:40:45,557 --> 00:40:48,117
- General, I...
- There's nothing more to worry about.

387
00:40:52,264 --> 00:40:53,822
Lisa?

388
00:40:56,134 --> 00:40:57,863
Very good work.

389
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:06,921
I need a team downstairs. Now.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
