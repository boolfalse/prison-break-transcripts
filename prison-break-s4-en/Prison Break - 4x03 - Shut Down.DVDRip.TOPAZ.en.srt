1
00:00:02,219 --> 00:00:03,550
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,689
I'm giving you an opportunity
to avoid 15 years in jail.

3
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:08,620
- In exchange for?
- Scylla.

4
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:11,654
These are GPS ankle monitors.
I'm your boss.

5
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:14,956
And if I ask you to put on a monitor,
you put on the monitor.

6
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:18,293
Whistler's assignment was
to drop off Scylla to a Company executive.

7
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:20,299
And his job was to protect it.

8
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,698
When this is all done, you and me,
we're gonna settle up.

9
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,099
I'm looking for Alex.

10
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,141
- Mom.
- We're done talking.

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,709
Hey, hey. You don't wanna go in there.
You don't wanna go in there.

12
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,221
Where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows?

13
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:46,487
I swear to you,
I have no idea where they are.

14
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:49,331
- What's wrong?
- Whatever it is, it ain't it.

15
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:53,458
If Scylla was like a pizza,
all we got is a slice.

16
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,504
So Scylla isn't one card. It's six.

17
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:15,085
- Hey. What did you pull us into?
- Excuse me?

18
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:20,059
You figured you'd get us on the hook so we
could find out how screwed this thing was.

19
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,028
- What the hell are you talking about?
- The card, Agent Self.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,603
- I'm talking about the card. It's useless.
- Wait, hold on. You already got the card?

21
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:30,331
Yes, but without the other five cards,
it means nothing.

22
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,441
And I can only assume you knew that.

23
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:34,204
What other five?

24
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:37,278
Don't.

25
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,572
What other five?

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,577
Roland downloaded the card.
There's no Company data on the card.

27
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:46,187
So without the other five cards,
it's unreadable.

28
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,290
It's like one-sixth of the puzzle.

29
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,449
That's not my problem
because we had a deal.

30
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:53,289
- And we gave you what you asked for.
- No, you didn't.

31
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:56,193
We had a deal for you to get me Scylla
and you haven't.

32
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,834
- You gave me your word.
- I'm giving you my word again.

33
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:02,733
You will go back to prison
if you can't get me those other five cards.

34
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:09,038
But if you can't get this done, just
let me know and we'll get your cell ready.

35
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,908
- You understand?
- I'll get it done.

36
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:14,107
There's one more thing.

37
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,818
- What did he say?
- We gotta find the other cards.

38
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,323
Screw that, man. We got the card.
Let's do the break-in and end this.

39
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:26,257
- Doesn't work that way.
- It's not fair, we did what he said.

40
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:29,557
Then call Agent Self,
tell him you wanna go back to Fox River.

41
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:33,762
Hell, we're all gonna go to prison
if we can't find the other cards.

42
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:38,335
When the government gets scared,
they tend to cut the cord.

43
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:40,476
Did Self talk about shutting us down?

44
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:43,943
Let's just concentrate on finding Scylla,
all right?

45
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,014
Alex.

46
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:53,452
- Where is he going?
- Who cares?

47
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:56,820
How we gonna find Scylla?
We don't even know where to start.

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,094
- Where's the rest of the stuff you found?
- Still printing it up.

49
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,965
When my device was in Tuxhorn's house,
it must've been next to his PDA.

50
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,399
Sucked up data from it.
I got e-mails and photos.

51
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,630
- You see anything we can use?
- No, and let me be crystal clear.

52
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:13,605
I point and click.
Other than that, I'm off the clock.

53
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,677
- Shut up.
- Wait. Where's his calendar?

54
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:17,278
Dr. Feelgood's got it.

55
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:20,574
Here, take a look at this.

56
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,275
This is today's date.
There's nothing on it but a star.

57
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,446
Every other date has details for his
meetings, who he's with, when and where.

58
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,355
- This is the only thing with nothing.
- Must be a reason he's keeping that secret.

59
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:34,463
Why are we letting Self call the shots?
We should play hardball.

60
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,963
From now on, either help out or get out.

61
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,534
If you open your mouth,
I expect you to offer up a solution.

62
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:43,399
I'm not gonna say it again.

63
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:02,853
<i>- Hello?
- Do you know who this is?</i>

64
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:09,693
- Yeah. Where are you being held?
- I'm not in prison.

65
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,857
<i>- Where are you?
- I can't say.</i>

66
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,402
I need you to get something to me in L.A.

67
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:20,509
<i>- Alex.
- It's nothing dangerous. Please, I... I...</i>

68
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,204
I don't know how much more time
I have here.

69
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:27,640
Look, don't ask me to do something...

70
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:32,845
You just need to reach out
to the residential agency in Durango.

71
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:35,583
Alex, no.

72
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:38,185
Do you know what they did?

73
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,193
They killed my son.

74
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,897
They killed my boy.

75
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:55,911
- I don't know what to say.
- Just say that you'll help me.

76
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:58,409
Please? I just need your help.

77
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,608
I need to find out who did it.

78
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,475
Please.

79
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,048
Hey.

80
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,648
Hey.

81
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,316
I know in Fox River
you had to keep secrets from me.

82
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:14,327
You don't now. What's going on?

83
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:21,430
Self said we have until the end of the day
to find the next cardholder...

84
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:23,295
...or we all go back to prison.

85
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:06,114
I know that you bailed out
Scofield and Burrows.

86
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,547
And I know they aren't in a supermax
in Texas.

87
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:12,950
But you know where they are,
don't you, Bruce?

88
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,285
You don't want any more trouble
than you're already in.

89
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,459
I'm not the one in trouble.

90
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,299
Let me help you relax.

91
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:43,250
It's a beautiful day. The sun is shining.

92
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,018
Do you feel that gentle breeze?

93
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:55,494
It's a great day for a family picnic.

94
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:59,061
Don't you think so, Bruce?

95
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:04,664
Six cards?
That's not what you sold me, Don.

96
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,174
- I realize it's more than we anticipated.
- More than you anticipated.

97
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:12,007
I already have people questioning me
about the supermax line we're selling.

98
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,275
- This whole thing was a mistake.
- No, no, this wasn't a mistake.

99
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:19,012
Scofield got us a card within 24 hours
of being dropped in Los Angeles.

100
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,416
He knows what he's doing.

101
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,055
Look, I'm willing to take the risk and do my
job here. I don't understand why you aren't.

102
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,788
I've been in Homeland Security
before it had a name.

103
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:30,592
Since before you
even had a short and curly, so don't...

104
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:33,361
Then you should know
what's at stake here, director.

105
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,937
But we could stop it,
but not if you end this now.

106
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:41,907
I'm calling Senator Dallow now.
I will see if he wants this thing killed or not.

107
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,878
But he follows my recommendations,
Don.

108
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:55,687
"Sir, changed your late London arrival.
Now 7-16 at 4 p.m."

109
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:58,986
Today's the 16th, but there's nothing
about London in his calendar.

110
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:00,322
Not that we've seen, no.

111
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:04,159
- Nothing about travel to or from the U. K?
- No, nothing.

112
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:06,928
Why would he get an e-mail
about an arrival in London...

113
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:09,469
...when he has no business
scheduled there?

114
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,268
Probably because the e-mail is a code.

115
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:19,172
Alex, I'm so glad you joined us.

116
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:25,310
S-C-Y-L-L-A, Scylla.
The meeting today at 4 is about Scylla.

117
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:28,048
Tuxhorn did not schedule a meeting
with himself...

118
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:30,852
...so that is where
we're gonna find our next cardholder.

119
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:33,587
Okay, so 4 p.m. Is our when.
We need a where.

120
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,324
If you were having a secret meeting,
you wouldn't send the information together.

121
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,628
You'd send the where and the when
separately as a precaution.

122
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:46,201
Were there other e-mails sent to Tuxhorn
around the same time as the London e-mail?

123
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:49,868
Within a few seconds of the London mail,
two more followed from the same IP.

124
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:53,538
My device ran out of space. It picked up
the IP address but not the content.

125
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:56,844
Trace the IP address.
Find out who sent the e-mails.

126
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,717
E-mails get bounced to routers all over
the world before they end in your Inbox.

127
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,154
Wherever the mail's been,
it leaves a shadow file.

128
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:07,194
Based on the geography, I'm guessing these
e-mails squatted at the Anaheim server...

129
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:11,493
...a nanosecond before reaching Tuxhorn.
That's where you're gonna find your file.

130
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:12,999
So get it.

131
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,660
Not every geek with a Commodore 64
can hack into NASA.

132
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:18,534
These servers have more firewalls
than the devil's bedroom.

133
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,235
You want those e-mails?
I'm sorry, it's on a main server in Anaheim.

134
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:24,846
It is possible to find those e-mails
at that server?

135
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,346
- Technologically possible.
- We're going to Anaheim.

136
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,508
I want you two
to go to Tuxhorn's workplace.

137
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:32,416
Stake it out.
If you see him, tail him and call us.

138
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,887
You're just gonna walk up to a main server?
There's gonna be security.

139
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:38,926
We don't have a choice.
We have to find that e-mail message.

140
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:42,394
We find out where the meeting is,
we find our next cardholder. Got it?

141
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:44,931
- And we stay out of jail.
- Yeah, good luck, man.

142
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,661
- Actually, you're coming with us.
- Guess again.

143
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,829
Self told me to sit here
and make with the... on the keyboard.

144
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,539
I'm not going nowhere.

145
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,843
Oh, yeah, you are.

146
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:14,095
Hello?

147
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:21,866
"Instahomes welcomes you home...

148
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:26,798
...to your furnished apartment."

149
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:47,024
Why must you go after this man?

150
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:50,324
Where I come from,
there's something called a blood feud.

151
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,731
You coming back?

152
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,936
Michael Scofield left me for dead
one too many times.

153
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:11,484
Good news, Bruce,
your favorite aunt made it to the picnic.

154
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:13,918
She brought lemonade.

155
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,416
The little cousins are swimming
in the pond.

156
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:22,192
Brothers and sisters are playing catch...

157
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:26,199
...in a lush green field.

158
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,495
Everyone is here.

159
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,105
Well, almost everyone.

160
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:39,979
Two very important people are missing.

161
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,052
Where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows?

162
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,182
I don't know.

163
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,555
That's okay, Bruce.

164
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:55,728
I'm sure you'll remember soon.

165
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,292
Just enjoy the picnic.

166
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:08,874
Hi, my name is Stephanie Reed. I'm here
for a job interview with Human Resources.

167
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,013
Okay, then.

168
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,979
Sorry, your name's not in the system.

169
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:21,981
- Would you look again under, R-E-E-D.
- Sure.

170
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:26,325
She should drop a few buttons on that shirt,
the guard will give her the e-mails.

171
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,827
Great.

172
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:32,591
- Yes?
- You're in Anaheim, Michael?

173
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:35,328
This is a strange time
to be taking a trip to Disney.

174
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:39,372
- Listen to me, if you're trying to run...
- I'm trying to get you another card.

175
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:42,773
- From where, Tomorrowland?
- From an e-mail on a main router.

176
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,209
There's a Scylla meeting
this afternoon at 4:00.

177
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:48,578
- Where?
- That information will be on the e-mail.

178
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:52,517
- Michael, we're running out of time.
- Then stop wasting mine.

179
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,282
I gotta go. I gotta go.

180
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,183
Did you talk to Senator Dallow?

181
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,091
Yes, I did. Now I need to talk to you.

182
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:03,357
I'm shutting it down.

183
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,467
I'm sorry, ma'am. I don't have you down
for any meeting today.

184
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay.

185
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,739
Yeah, the temp agency
said that they had set the interview.

186
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,638
Again, I'm sorry.

187
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:17,073
Okay.

188
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,982
It was really hard to get a sitter today.

189
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:25,476
Would you call Human Resources
and see if they'll see me since I'm here?

190
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:27,350
Sure.

191
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,652
Hey, it's Tom at the front desk.

192
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:37,925
Yeah, I've got a Stephanie Reed here.
She said she had a job interview.

193
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:42,971
Stephanie Reed. R-E-E-D.

194
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:47,174
She just passed it off to Michael.

195
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:54,274
The server room could be anywhere.

196
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,648
Network and wiring specifications
require a server that's on the first floor...

197
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:01,847
...centrally located, like right there.

198
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:04,458
What are you, an engineer or something?

199
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,697
- You know how to drive this thing?
- It's gonna take a while.

200
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,337
- I don't wanna get busted.
- Relax. Find those e-mails.

201
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:19,736
When I steal, I do it from home,
in my boxers, eating Krispity Krunch.

202
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:22,343
No chance of being seen,
no chance of getting caught.

203
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:24,342
- Just get it done.
- Okay.

204
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:27,209
Okay. All right.

205
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,484
Come on. Come on. Come on.

206
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,051
Hey, lady. Did you get what I need?

207
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,158
Yeah, I got it.

208
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,695
Thank you.

209
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:48,995
I know what you're planning, Alex.

210
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:54,271
Listen, if you do track him down, call me.
Don't do something that could get you hurt.

211
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:55,467
I won't.

212
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,512
So the material will be where you asked
by 5 p.m.

213
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:04,244
And, Alex, I'm so sorry.

214
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:09,254
Goodbye, Lang.

215
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:15,996
Sorry, they can't see you today.
There's nothing more I can do.

216
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,690
Okay. Thank you for your help.
I appreciate it.

217
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,599
Hey.

218
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:28,270
What was the name of the temp agency
that sent you?

219
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:32,376
Maybe we can call them together
and figure this all out?

220
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:35,108
- I have it in my car.
- Where is my security badge?

221
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:37,752
It ain't at my station.
It was when you showed up.

222
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,252
Take your hands off me.
I don't have your badge.

223
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:41,583
We'll see about that.

224
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,388
Sara's in trouble.

225
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:47,855
- What's going on?
- She's been made.

226
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,365
<i>- Sara's been made.
- Is she all right?</i>

227
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,764
The guard has her.
You gotta get out of there.

228
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:56,567
- Roland, I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

229
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,536
Just keep working.

230
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:04,705
Like I said, I don't have your badge.
Excuse me, I need to leave.

231
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,872
You can tell your story to the cops,
sister.

232
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,919
Don't move.

233
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:20,552
Hey!

234
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:22,887
Hey!

235
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:26,093
Where are you? Where are you?
Come on. Come on.

236
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:27,394
Come on. Come on.

237
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,008
- What the hell?
- Roland, talk to me.

238
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:36,303
- We're almost there. Almost there.
- We gotta go.

239
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,275
- We gotta go now.
- Got it.

240
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,010
What's going on?
Why won't the door open?

241
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,548
What the hell is that?

242
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:53,423
It's a fail-safe device.
Activated when the alarm gets pulled.

243
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:58,124
- To protect the server from fire damage.
- Then why the hell did you pull it?

244
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:01,794
This is an old building.
It shouldn't have such an advanced system.

245
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:03,996
Okay, well, clearly it does. What's it do?

246
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,004
To kill the fire,
it sucks all the oxygen out of this room.

247
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:26,517
Michael, where are you?
It's getting crowded out here.

248
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:28,560
We're trapped. We're in the server room.

249
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,164
<i>- What?
- It's sealed.</i>

250
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:34,325
It's sucking all the oxygen out. We got two,
maybe three, minutes of air left.

251
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:37,336
Linc? Linc!

252
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:58,520
I can't breathe. I can't... I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

253
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:14,274
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

254
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:16,536
- Just calm down.
- I can't...

255
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,772
Calm down.
When you panic it gets worse.

256
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:27,680
Come on. Let's go!

257
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:40,398
- You think we're spinning our wheels?
- We got no choice.

258
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:43,595
- Better see if he shows.
- I'm not talking about finding Tuxhorn.

259
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,969
I'm talking about finding the cards.
About finding six cards.

260
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:51,909
About whether we have a snowball's
chance in Haiti of actually doing this deed.

261
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,708
Better than no chance.

262
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,249
I'm just saying,
we're a couple hours from Mexico...

263
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:01,014
...I wouldn't mind having someone with me
who could speak the native tongue.

264
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,384
Just do your job, Brad.

265
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:14,432
You feeling good, Bruce?

266
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,168
You look great.

267
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:23,637
Your father, Josh, is so happy
you made it to the family reunion picnic.

268
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:26,405
He's missed you very much.

269
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:28,740
My father's dead.

270
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,253
That's right.

271
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:37,983
He is.

272
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,292
You see that, Bruce?

273
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:45,032
You just told me the truth
in response to something I said.

274
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:51,098
Because lying is so hard right now.

275
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:56,310
But telling the truth is so easy.

276
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:59,447
So tell me the truth.

277
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:03,279
Tell me what everyone at the picnic
wants to know.

278
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:08,151
Tell me where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows?

279
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:10,451
I don't... I don't know. I...

280
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:31,311
Bruce, a bad storm is coming.

281
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:39,420
A real bad storm.

282
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:44,150
Don Self.

283
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,090
Good.
So the senator did get my message?

284
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,255
No, no, I'm sorry,
tomorrow's too late. Okay?

285
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:52,423
I need to speak to him now.

286
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:56,527
Thank you. Thank you.

287
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:59,834
Agent Self, it's time to go.

288
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:15,447
<i>Papa Paul's Pizza Palace.</i>

289
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:18,593
I'd like a large with extra pepperoni
and extra cheese.

290
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:22,922
<i>The Nobbit.</i>

291
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:26,027
<i>Add Mama to the Train.</i>

292
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,136
<i>Amateur Screen Test Number Nine.</i>

293
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:31,033
And we have a winner.

294
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,725
<i>Thank you for calling GA TE,
how may I help you?</i>

295
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,601
The first e-mail's an ad for Discretia.

296
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:12,443
An e-mail for pecker pills?

297
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:15,840
- You want the number?
- That's great.

298
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:18,350
Definitely worth almost losing my life for.

299
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,956
Second e-mail's an invitation
to join some kind of Stargazers Club.

300
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:25,821
You know, constellations can be used
to track points on Earth.

301
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:29,259
There's a website that lets you enter
the coordinates of star patterns.

302
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:33,458
And depending on the date,
it'll pick a corresponding location on Earth.

303
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:36,498
And you know this because?

304
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,203
Because my son...

305
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:44,139
...and my ex and I used to go on this site.

306
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:48,215
He would look up at the sky
and know where I was.

307
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:51,117
That's not it.
That constellation's over Antarctica.

308
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,551
He's not gonna get there today,
by 4 p.m., not from L.A.

309
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:57,658
So I almost died for nothing.
That's good to know.

310
00:22:57,826 --> 00:23:00,590
- A lot of people have died.
- That's their problem, boss.

311
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:03,993
Because anyone who gives up their life
for this crap is a sucker...

312
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,964
...because you guys can't win.

313
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:09,499
Say it.

314
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:12,204
Say it about the people who died.

315
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:14,706
- Say it. Say it.
- Alex.

316
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:16,504
Alex.

317
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:19,140
Alex.

318
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,679
Get up. Get back to your nerd box
and do your job.

319
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:34,860
We could get a little place
by the water.

320
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,760
You'd be better off
not being on the run by yourself.

321
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:42,267
I vouched for you, Bellick. I told Michael,
"Brad helped me get to Chicago.

322
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:44,701
He's a good guy, trust him."

323
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:48,832
Are you crazy? Now you just wanna run
when we have a chance to clear our names?

324
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,535
Odds of that don't look so good.

325
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:54,671
Tanks full, gas pedal's on the right. I say
we get the hell out of dodge right now.

326
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,081
We can worry about the ankle bracelets
once we get over the border.

327
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,788
There's only one thing I'm thinking about.

328
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:03,652
She weighed 7 pounds,
has her mother's eyes...

329
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:06,453
...and my heart
in the palm of her tiny hand.

330
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:10,689
So if I gotta find one card, or six cards,
or 6 million cards...

331
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,458
...l'm gonna do whatever it takes.

332
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:15,068
Because I only got to hold my baby
for 10 seconds...

333
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:17,797
...and that wasn't nearly long enough.

334
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,398
What are you doing?

335
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:23,704
- This guy ain't showing up.
- Get your hands where I can see them!

336
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,347
- Get your hands up!
- Oh, my God, this ain't good.

337
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:28,415
- Put your hands up.
- I got them up.

338
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:32,145
Put your hands up, Sucre. Come on.
Who you calling? They're gonna shoot.

339
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:35,085
- Come on, put your hands up.
- Okay. Okay. Don't shoot.

340
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:37,282
- Don't shoot.
- Get your hands up.

341
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:40,222
Computer's frozen.

342
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:44,388
- What do you mean, it's frozen?
- I don't know. It's not responding to me.

343
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,296
- I've rebooted twice. Still not letting me on.
- Try again.

344
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:51,565
I've tried even a back-door entry. You were
in prison, you're familiar with that.

345
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,833
- You wanna stop breathing?
- What happened?

346
00:24:56,712 --> 00:25:01,342
They locked me out.
I'm telling you, they're shutting us down.

347
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:05,518
- We gotta go. They're coming after us.
- Where you?

348
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:08,417
- Let's go. Come on.
- Wait a minute. We run, they shoot us.

349
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,914
Then stay.

350
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,116
- Sara?
- Yeah.

351
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:13,090
Let's get out of here.

352
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:35,315
You said
we'd have until the end of today.

353
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:38,647
No, this goes way over my head.
This project's been terminated.

354
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,482
- Now pull over and end this.
- But we can finish the job.

355
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:44,820
There is no more job, okay?
If you make this takedown public...

356
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:48,258
...going back to prison
is gonna be the least of your worries.

357
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,125
Lose him.

358
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:25,833
Stay on them. Stay on them.

359
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:05,930
- Come on. Let's get out!
- Go!

360
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:09,299
Let's go. Let's go.

361
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,248
Go! Go! Go!

362
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:25,819
<i>Thank you for calling GA TE,
how may I help you?</i>

363
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:30,021
Yes, hi. My name is Cole Pfeiffer.
I'm calling about my commencement bonus.

364
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:34,259
- I haven't received it yet, and...
- Oh, of course. Mr. Pfeiffer.

365
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:35,994
Mr. White is out right now...

366
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:38,731
<i>... but he's gonna be so upset
he missed your call.</i>

367
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,240
- Here, let me try to track him down.
- No, no. Don't bother.

368
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,402
Maybe you just could forward
the check to me.

369
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,744
Mr. White has to sign off on any checks.
I know that he really wants to talk to you...

370
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,978
...so can I have him reach you
on the number that came up on my ID?

371
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:55,214
Looking forward to it.

372
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:05,294
This way. Come on.

373
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:16,811
Why did you tell Self
that we could get a cardholder by today?

374
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:19,003
He set the terms. I didn't have a choice.

375
00:28:19,181 --> 00:28:22,150
Now none of us have a choice.
And I am not going back to prison.

376
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:25,718
- And I still have things that I need to...
- Then go ahead! Go ahead, run!

377
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:27,184
Guys! Cut it out.

378
00:28:27,355 --> 00:28:30,813
We ain't running anywhere
with these things on our ankles, all right.

379
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:36,990
It's over here. It's this way.

380
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,731
Wait a minute. Wait a second.

381
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:43,830
The signal is gone.

382
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,531
Where are they?
Okay, we gotta go get the signal.

383
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:49,404
Let's get the signal.

384
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:57,976
We cannot stay here forever.
They will eventually figure this out.

385
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,417
I don't care if this place
blocks the signal.

386
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:03,080
What are you doing, man?
We don't have time for this.

387
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:06,318
The answers are here.
If I can find them, we might have a chance.

388
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,258
It's an ad. The words don't make sense.
It's gibberish.

389
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:11,899
Exactly, that's what makes them ideal
for hiding data.

390
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:15,833
Forget about the damn cardholder.
Self's pulled the plug on us.

391
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:22,501
Are you okay?

392
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:26,246
Yeah. Yeah.

393
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:28,947
We're gonna figure this out.

394
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:31,848
We're getting good
at pulling off the impossible.

395
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,250
Hell, I came back from the dead, right?
What is it?

396
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:42,029
What do you see?

397
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:50,102
They go over each other.

398
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:20,664
"Power, plant, new, beach."

399
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:24,901
There's a power plant in Newport Beach.
That's your meeting.

400
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,565
We ain't got a long until 4:00.
How the hell are we gonna get out of here?

401
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,938
How fast can you run?

402
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:37,175
- Got a signal?
- Yeah.

403
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:40,014
They're heading west, four blocks.

404
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:42,045
Go!

405
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,658
- Out of the cab.
- What? What?

406
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:50,093
- Get out of the cab.
- What do you think you doing?

407
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,200
- Move it!
- Hey!

408
00:30:53,702 --> 00:30:55,363
Hey!

409
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:03,368
Hello?

410
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:06,180
Cole Pfeiffer. Gregory White here.

411
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:10,717
Oh, sorry to disturb you sir.
I was just calling about the bonus stipend.

412
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:12,648
Bother me? What are you talking about?

413
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:15,722
I'm thrilled to finally be able
to put a voice to the e-mails.

414
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,859
And better yet, I'm gonna be able
to put a face to the voice.

415
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:24,291
- Right, because, we haven't met yet.
- Yes, and that is a crime, my friend.

416
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:28,732
There are a lot of people over here at GATE
who are very excited about meeting you.

417
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:31,394
<i>I'm going on to San Francisco tomorrow
with my wife...</i>

418
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:35,475
...and I'd love to see you before I go.
So come to GATE first thing in the morning.

419
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,305
<i>We can all learn something
from the number one salesman...</i>

420
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,345
<i>... in the entire Northeast region.</i>

421
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:44,581
Well, it's what GATE teaches.

422
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:49,287
"You can unshackle others
with the keys of knowledge."

423
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:53,757
It's what I'm here to share. It's what
I know. It's what I wanna give back.

424
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:58,723
That's why I started this company so that
people can avoid the captivity of negativity.

425
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,425
<i>- Amen to that. Amen.
- I gotta go. I've got a lunch.</i>

426
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:03,264
But I'll see you at GATE tomorrow.

427
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:06,168
We'll set your office up.
Get you in the payroll system.

428
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,003
And I will personally hand you
your bonus check.

429
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,543
Well, I'll see you at GATE tomorrow then.

430
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:17,946
Grab a bat, Cole Pfeiffer,
coach just put you in the game.

431
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:41,436
Strange place for a meeting.
A little cloak and dagger, don't you think?

432
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:44,134
Belts and suspenders, Stuart.
Belts and suspenders.

433
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:45,404
Why Laos?

434
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,175
A doctor doesn't perform his first dissection
on a human cadaver.

435
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,753
First he learns on a frog, then a pig.
Then one day a human.

436
00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:58,950
Laos is our frog,
perhaps Denmark or Chad will be our pig.

437
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:03,496
After that,
anything we want could be our cadaver.

438
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:11,696
Let's check on the other side
of the complex.

439
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:13,966
They could be meeting there.

440
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:30,248
- Don't you move!
- Stay down! Stay down!

441
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,620
- Don't move! Do not move!
- Stay down! Stay down!

442
00:33:32,794 --> 00:33:35,194
- Agent Mahone! Stop!
- Go!

443
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:38,332
- You sure about this?
- Yeah. Go.

444
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,805
Freeze. Don't move. Hands up.
Keep you hands where I can see them.

445
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:49,776
Come on.

446
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,271
Freeze!

447
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,641
Stop! Hold it!

448
00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:57,808
- Hands up!
- Hold it! Don't move.

449
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:01,214
Get him cuffed.

450
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,354
Scofield ran.
It won't take long to find him.

451
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:10,061
- You're delaying the inevitable.
- It wasn't, it's a meeting with Scylla.

452
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:11,562
Shut up. Get him in the car.

453
00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:14,964
They got a meeting
on the other side of that building.

454
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,297
- It's over! It's over Lincoln!
- It's not over!

455
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,134
I know you wanted this to work out
but it's beyond me now.

456
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,641
- Okay? It's done. I have orders. It's over!
- It's not.

457
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,971
It's finished!

458
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:47,058
So when exactly does
the oporder commence, general?

459
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:48,259
It already has.

460
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:50,631
No, I mean,
when do we see ramifications?

461
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:55,208
I'll tell you what Stuart, you worry about
the gigahertz and the offshore drilling...

462
00:34:55,376 --> 00:34:57,207
...and let me worry about the oporders.

463
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:14,758
There they come.

464
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,776
What about her?

465
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:39,777
Let her go.

466
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:44,282
Real group of winners you hooked me
up with. Thanks. I appreciate it.

467
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:49,061
We both have worn the badge in our day,
I can't survive anymore time in lockup.

468
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,563
- Can we please work something out?
- You can work your ass into this van.

469
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:56,135
- Congratulations, the Company wins.
- Go on. Get in.

470
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:58,298
What? Get in.

471
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:13,314
You gotta be kidding me.

472
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:17,915
It's Michael.

473
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,787
Easy.

474
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:25,622
I gave you a good enough head start.
You should have took advantage of it.

475
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:30,003
Yeah, but then I wouldn't be able
to give you this. Press the video function.

476
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:34,401
It wasn't a meeting between
two Scylla cardholders, Agent Self.

477
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:36,941
It was a meeting
between all six cardholders.

478
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,477
So now we know
who has the other five cards.

479
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:41,114
And that should mean something.

480
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,546
Even to someone
who's word means nothing.

481
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:51,188
I'm gonna call Senator Dallow now.
He follows my recommendations, Don.

482
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,600
The next time you run from me, I'm not
gonna be chasing you down in a car.

483
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,364
It's gonna be with a bullet in your back.

484
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,605
Let them go.

485
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:12,241
- All of them.
- Agent, come on.

486
00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:16,508
Let them go.
Put them in the warehouse.

487
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:18,276
All of them.

488
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,478
Bring them out.

489
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:30,324
Yeah, it's Don Self.
I need to talk to him, right now.

490
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:32,763
Right now.

491
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:46,746
Some day soon...

492
00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:51,112
...we're gonna drop that little boat of yours
in the water and disappear forever.

493
00:37:51,285 --> 00:37:52,377
I promise.

494
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:26,079
Hey, where's Mr. Personality going?
They check his bracelet, he's bust...

495
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,951
Let him be.

496
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,651
Insubordination's tiring, huh?

497
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:10,854
Where do you get off
calling Senator Dallow directly?

498
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:14,229
You don't move into my city,
my regional office, and go over my head.

499
00:39:14,402 --> 00:39:17,963
What do you want from me?
You know how it works, Herb.

500
00:39:18,406 --> 00:39:20,966
You think when the Company's
breathing down your neck...

501
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:23,269
...Senator Dallow's
gonna bring in the cavalry?

502
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:25,779
He'll pretend
he's never even heard of you.

503
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,546
You're on your own from now on.
You're an Island.

504
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:31,651
If I'm an island,
what are you doing in here?

505
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:34,720
Just get out of my office
and let me finish what I started.

506
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:39,455
When you do get buried...

507
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:42,159
...l'll be the first one there with a shovel.

508
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,127
Great. I'll see you then.

509
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:59,971
Sara Tancredi's somewhere safe,
isn't she, Bruce?

510
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,378
You would have made sure of that,
wouldn't you?

511
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:12,389
So tell me where is Sara?

512
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,190
Help me get your family to Sara,
where it's safe.

513
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:18,593
Safe.

514
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,073
Los Angeles?

515
00:40:28,776 --> 00:40:30,038
Where in Los Angeles?

516
00:40:31,812 --> 00:40:33,837
I don't know.

517
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,108
I don't know.

518
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:41,354
I believe you.

519
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:52,029
Good job.

520
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:57,461
Picnic's over, Bruce.

521
00:41:17,925 --> 00:41:20,223
What's up with Mahone?

522
00:41:20,995 --> 00:41:22,656
They murdered his son.

523
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:28,224
The Company killed his son
like they tried to kill L.J.

524
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,210
Alex, I...

525
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,287
I know what happened.

526
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:50,518
I'm sorry.

527
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,390
They did this...

528
00:41:57,898 --> 00:41:59,957
...to get to me.

529
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,969
To flush me out.

530
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:10,842
And then they'll let my ex-wife stay alive.

531
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:16,581
Just so she could tell me
that she was next...

532
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,685
...if I didn't turn myself in.

533
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:20,916
But now she's in protective custody...

534
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:26,082
...and I'm living in a warehouse trying
to find the son of a bitch who killed my kid.

535
00:42:28,362 --> 00:42:30,762
We're all here for somebody.

536
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,767
All of us are here for someone.

537
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,334
You need to stay focused
until this is done.

538
00:42:39,073 --> 00:42:41,268
I can do my job.

539
00:42:41,575 --> 00:42:43,475
I promise.

540
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:50,049
I promise I'll do whatever it takes to help
you find the person that killed your son.

541
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:52,310
And the people behind the hit.

542
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,081
We're gonna get these guys, Alex.

543
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,348
I'm gonna help you.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
