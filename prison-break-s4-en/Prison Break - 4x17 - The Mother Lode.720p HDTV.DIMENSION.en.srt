1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,400
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,790
Your mother works

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,330
for us.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,630
Your mother is alive.

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,690
You know, I'm thinking more and more that this

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,990
- is an inside job.  - Why?

7
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,460
The hardware he brought to the meet.

8
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,260
He could read Scylla right on the spot.

9
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,130
Hands on your head.

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,790
Michael, we've got to get out of here!

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,260
Get in!

12
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,400
Sorry, but right now I want my life back

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,400
more than I want your money.

14
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,500
Where's Scylla?

15
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,160
Let's talk about that, okay?

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,230
Where is he?

17
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,160
I can get him.

18
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,060
No, he can't.

19
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,200
He's stalling, Linc.

20
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,400
- He's gone.  - You're right.

21
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,430
- You have no idea who this guy's working for?  - No.

22
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,500
No clue.

23
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,930
Your boy's dead.

24
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,960
And now

25
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,430
I'm coming after you.

26
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,060
Who was that?

27
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,890
It was my son.

28
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,630
Lincoln.

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,560
What is this?

30
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,960
I don't know...

31
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,460
Just found them on the doorstep.

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,500
Son of a...

33
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,130
They lay one hand on my mama, I swear on my life...

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,260
She's in a state home.

35
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,130
I thought we were working with these people.

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,460
So did I.

37
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,890
I'm gonna make a call.

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,060
Find out what's going on.

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,600
Mr. Burrows.

40
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,930
We had a deal.

41
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,430
Our deal is contingent upon the retrieval of Scylla.

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,960
Based on the mediocrity of your performance

43
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,560
on that front thus far,

44
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,360
I thought it best to make sure you're all properly motivated.

45
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,890
Just tell me how your team is progressing.

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,330
I swear to God, man, when I,

47
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,630
when I get a hold of you...

48
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,730
If I were you,

49
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,330
I'd be doing everything in my power

50
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,630
to demonstrate my competence right now.

51
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,760
We killed the guy who came to Miami.

52
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,960
We found some keys on him.

53
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,400
We're looking into them.

54
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,730
Are we done?

55
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,890
Not quite.

56
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,300
A new competitor

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,860
has joined the search.

58
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,200
We're the ones getting Scylla.

59
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,530
Well, that's good to hear,

60
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,890
because the competing party, is your brother Michael.

61
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,300
Michael's with you.

62
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Michael's getting treatment with you.

63
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,030
Apparently Michael's

64
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,730
a little more headstrong than either of us imagined.

65
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,060
But don't worry.

66
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,200
We have a lead on him somewhere in central Arizona.

67
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,030
Mr. Oren is waiting in his limousine.

68
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,230
If you speak to Michael,

69
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,160
tell him to find a very good hiding place.

70
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,400
Because if any of my men spot him,

71
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,730
they've been given a green light.

72
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,400
2,500 miles to go.

73
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,990
If we take turns sleeping

74
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,530
we can be there by tomorrow night.

75
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,660
Should we call Lincoln? Let him know we're coming?

76
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,890
Michael, he took the Company's deal

77
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,530
to save your life.

78
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,790
And for what it's worth, I might've done the same thing.

79
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,860
Then you'd be wrong, too.

80
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,230
You know, this promises to be a really, really long ride.

81
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,030
So, how about we just...

82
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,230
Call truce, all right?

83
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,090
Forgot napkins.

84
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,930
Come on.

85
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,890
He comes anywhere near my kid...

86
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,690
You know, Don,

87
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,400
you seem to be taking this whole thing pretty well.

88
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,090
Yeah, well, I'm a pretty calm guy.

89
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,330
All I'm saying is,

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,060
my mama, his son, his wife.

91
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,030
We don't even know who they got on you.

92
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,300
That's because it's none of your business.

93
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,330
All right, all you need to worry about

94
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,530
is that I'm here to do a job.

95
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,960
Hold-Secure.

96
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,730
The company that manufactures the keys.

97
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,600
It's called Hold-Secure. Listen to this.

98
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,830
Each key they produce is implanted with a computer chip.

99
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,230
That chip sends out a unique

100
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,790
electronic signal that opens its lock.

101
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,330
Something that high-tech,

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,200
I'm telling you, I'm betting they got a database

103
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,730
that'll tell us exactly where each key's

104
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,560
corresponding lock has been installed.

105
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,300
Look at that.

106
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,130
These keys run about 500 bucks?!

107
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,960
You only spend that kind of money if you're

108
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,460
protecting something of vital importance.

109
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,030
Like Scylla.

110
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,160
Someone just tried to access

111
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,860
Carruth's account at Hold-Secure.

112
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,400
and what information was compromised?

113
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,730
We don't know yet.

114
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,360
And who was trying to access it?

115
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,760
We don't know.

116
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,430
Thank you for bringing that to my attention. Good work.

117
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
Yes?

118
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,200
It's your son.

119
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,360
We already have safeguards in place to deal with Lincoln.

120
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,730
I'm talking about Michael.

121
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,690
He's escaped Company custody.

122
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,400
He's coming to Miami right now.

123
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,430
Christina?

124
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,090
If only they understood what it is I'm trying to do.

125
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,990
Thank you very much.

126
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,630
Thanks.

127
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,090
Okay, what now?

128
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
We'll think of something.

129
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,790
Michael, we can't afford to buy a car

130
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,400
and we can't fly.

131
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,630
It's time to call your brother.

132
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,360
Got it.

133
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,530
We've got the locations of those two locks.

134
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,760
One's in Little Havana.

135
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,230
The other one's down by the water.

136
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,990
Perfect. Lincoln, why don't you and I...

137
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,360
You take Self and go to Little Havana.

138
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,630
We're gonna head south.

139
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,890
Huh, that's a surprise.

140
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,690
We need suntan lotion.

141
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,730
Be right there.

142
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,160
It's me.

143
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,400
What's your problem?

144
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,430
Look, I need you to hear me out on this, Linc.

145
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,300
Everything was all set up and you blew it.

146
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,430
You couldn't just let me handle this, could you?

147
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,830
If by "handle," you mean give Scylla back to the General,

148
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,600
then no, I couldn't.

149
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,600
It's more complicated than that.

150
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,890
Actually, it's not.

151
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Listen to me,

152
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,090
I want my life back

153
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,890
and this is the only way we can do that! 

154
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,560
I don't believe that's true.

155
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,790
You know what, man? 

156
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,060
You need to grow up.

157
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,830
Look, if that's how you really feel, Linc,

158
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,300
I should warn you I'm going to do everything in my power

159
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,930
to stop you.

160
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,260
I had a deal with the General.

161
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,960
You blew it.

162
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,300
He finds you, he's gonna kill you.

163
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,160
Surprise, surprise.

164
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,330
I did this for us, Michael.

165
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,860
You, me, Sara,

166
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,330
LJ, so you could be with Sara.

167
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,530
Two seconds, just think of your family.

168
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,830
Feels like family's the only thing

169
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,030
I can think about these days.

170
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,660
What does that mean?

171
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,930
Michael?

172
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,530
Linc, Mom is alive.

173
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,600
What?

174
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,030
Guess I'll see you in Miami.

175
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,160
We gotta get out of here.

176
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,990
Sir, you mind if I ask where you're going?

177
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,160
Dallas.

178
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,730
Mind if we hitch a ride?

179
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,200
I got 100 bucks, gas money.

180
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,500
Please?

181
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,030
Sir?

182
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,730
Cab's not big enough for the two of you. 

183
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,860
If you want to ride together

184
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,930
you're going to have to ride back here.

185
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,560
Done.

186
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,360
Get comfortable.

187
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,090
Gonna be eight hours till we stop again.

188
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,560
Linc...

189
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,730
If Scylla really is in there, there's gonna be security.

190
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,230
I need you focused.

191
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,960
Yeah.

192
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,990
All clear upstairs.

193
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,890
You find something?

194
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,830
Picture of my mom.

195
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,730
Someone must have known I was coming.

196
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,300
Someone who's connected enough to be working with Carruth

197
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,690
and who knows you well enough

198
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
to get their hands on that picture.

199
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,730
There's only one person I can think of

200
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,530
that fits that description.

201
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,230
You're saying my mom's in Miami?

202
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,630
If she was operating out of this house,

203
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,130
she certainly had access to money.

204
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,130
She's a Company agent.

205
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,500
Gretchen said she thought

206
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,230
that this could be an inside job.

207
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,890
Linc...

208
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,890
The mother killed Syla...

209
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,230
She used to bake cookies when we'd come home

210
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,690
from school,

211
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,930
play kickball with us in the backyard.

212
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,730
There's just no way that woman was a Company agent.

213
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,300
You did read her file, didn't you?

214
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,460
I saw medical repos

215
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,090
that said she had the same diagnosis I did

216
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,200
and that Company doctors operated

217
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,130
on her, too.

218
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,690
Now I'wondering if they took her off

219
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,530
to a log cabin in the woods after they were done,

220
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,130
introduced her to a friendly shrink.

221
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,630
How else could someone just stand by and watch

222
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,690
while their own children were hunted down like dogs?

223
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,660
Maybe she didn't know.

224
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,860
She knew.

225
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,890
Maybe it was over her head.

226
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,200
Or maybe she didn't care.

227
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,630
Anyway, I'm just surprised

228
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,730
the General waited so long to drop this bomb on us.

229
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,730
Actually, I think that part makes sense.

230
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,630
I mean, for whatever reason,

231
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,690
your mother didn't want you to know she was alive

232
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,090
or you would have known years ago.

233
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,130
The General was just keeping that secret, right?

234
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,360
Keeping her happy, keeping her working.

235
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,030
But now the game has changed.

236
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,030
Yeah, now he thinks you might be useful.

237
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,300
Just like Mom.

238
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,460
Beyond question, he possesses the most gifted mind

239
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,890
of any man I've ever encountered.

240
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,790
Well, I'll try not to take that too personally.

241
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,960
He drilled into your office safe

242
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,830
and copied your card without you even noticing.

243
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,030
As I recall, you were sitting right next to me.

244
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,400
If we could have turned Michael Scofield,

245
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,060
it would have been like having 30 more years of Christina.

246
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,260
Pull over.

247
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,230
That's my ride.

248
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,830
What's going on?

249
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,730
Good-bye, Jonathan.

250
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,990
This ain't the place.

251
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,200
I could pick

252
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,400
- that lock with my stump.  - No, n-no, n-no.

253
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,790
Remember what they say about books and their covers.

254
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,600
When Harry Winston donated the Hope Diamond

255
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,960
to the Smithsonian, you know how he got it from New York

256
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,890
toC?

257
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,730
Registered mail.

258
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,400
It's the safest way to go.

259
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,200
After all, who is going to be looking

260
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,400
for the Hope Diamond at the post office, right?

261
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,760
And who would be looking for Scylla

262
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,360
at some run-down storefront church

263
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,500
in Little Havana?

264
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,730
All right, let's assume you are right,

265
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,630
they got Scylla back there somewhere.

266
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,230
You walk in there, reeking that cop stink,

267
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,530
you won't last a second.

268
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,400
That's a good point.

269
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,830
That's why you're going in.

270
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,690
May I help you?

271
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,460
Yes, as a matter of fact.

272
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,430
I'm Charles Patoshik.

273
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,730
I'm a professor of anthropology

274
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,600
at Southern Florida University.

275
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,360
I'm doing some various research on various different kinds

276
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,460
of, uh, uh, uh, Caribbean religions, and, uh...

277
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,730
perhaps you could start

278
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,360
back there where you, you do your, uh, services.

279
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
That is our sanctuary.

280
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,330
Only the pure of soul

281
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,060
may venture inside.

282
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,060
I know.

283
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,460
I... I have been in many such rooms.

284
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,760
Let me see your hand.

285
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,830
Your soul is black,

286
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,430
stained with the blood of the innocent.

287
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,260
I cannot let you pass.

288
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,860
I have never been so offended in my life.

289
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,860
I suggest that you continue your research

290
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,860
elsewhere.

291
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,460
If you drop something

292
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,200
by accident,

293
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
you leave a fingerprint on it.

294
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,300
She wanted you to find this.

295
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,200
- Why?  - You ever seen it before?

296
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,030
No.

297
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,030
Do you remember

298
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,230
anything about that day?

299
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,330
I was four years old.

300
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,630
Any idea where it was taken?

301
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,230
No.

302
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,860
Hey.

303
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,630
You okay?

304
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,760
- I mean, if I found out my mom was...  - Listen,

305
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,500
as far as I'm concerned, she's not my mom.

306
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,860
She's just someone in the way of my freedom.

307
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,930
All right?

308
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,930
So, on my sixth birthday,

309
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,960
um, my father was long gone by then,

310
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,230
so it was just me, mom, and Linc, and...

311
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,890
Mom hands me my present...

312
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,930
my, uh, my only present... and I just know...

313
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,560
I just know it's the Millennium Falcon.

314
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,260
With the battle alert sound?

315
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,360
Exactly.

316
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,360
- I totally owned that.  - Of course you did.

317
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,760
Anyway, I had been asking for this thing for weeks,

318
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,930
and the package is just the right size, and...

319
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,360
I rip open the wrapping paper

320
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,130
and... it's a birdhouse.

321
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,400
Oh, no.

322
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,060
Oh, yeah, except it's not even a birdhouse.

323
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,930
It's actually a birdhouse kit.

324
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,060
I'm so sorry.

325
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,790
I didn't talk to her for two days after that,

326
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,960
but when she finally got me to open the thing,

327
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,400
we sat there together,

328
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,330
put it together piece by piece,

329
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,260
and it was the first thing I ever built.

330
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,630
And I loved it...

331
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,960
and she knew I would.

332
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,330
She knew me better than I knew myself.

333
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,260
That's what moms do.

334
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,960
Yeah, but the strange thing is...

335
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,830
even though I haven't seen her for 23 years,

336
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,890
there's this part of me

337
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,360
that feels like maybe she still does.

338
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,860
Your truck looks a little low to the ground.

339
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,860
You mind stepping outside?

340
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,960
I just got weighed 20 miles back.

341
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,500
You highway patrol?

342
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,830
Where are you going?

343
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,030
You've got no business in there.

344
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,160
Unless you show me a warrant,

345
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,260
you get the hell out of there right now.

346
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,500
Thank you.

347
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,230
Goodness.

348
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,090
I got my weigh station ticket

349
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,760
right here on the dash.

350
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,530
As soon as you see that... 

351
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,530
You'll see I got it right here.

352
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,430
Here you go.

353
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,760
I need you to follow me back to Phoenix.

354
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,300
Are you crazy?

355
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,930
I got to get this load to Dallas.

356
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,130
Well, that's your choice.

357
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,730
I got 'em.

358
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,690
I think we need to call your brother.

359
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,460
No signal.

360
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,090
We must be in the middle of nowhere.

361
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,930
Lincoln said that if the Company caught you...

362
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,360
I think I saw a side door back here.

363
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,360
What about the main door?

364
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,630
You'll never get that open.

365
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,530
I'm sure it's latched from the outside.

366
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,030
Can you open the side door? 

367
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,530
Maybe.

368
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,760
Sara.

369
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,830
Help me out.

370
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,890
I don't think we're going to be able to move this.

371
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,960
Maybe we won't have to.

372
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,890
I have troubling news about General Krantz.

373
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,300
He's alive.

374
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,160
I don't see how that's possible.

375
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,360
Yes, well, what I'm hearing is a helicopter with a medic took off

376
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,160
from Company headquarters in Los Angeles one hour ago.

377
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,360
It landed for two minutes in Canyon Country

378
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,660
and now it's back in Los Angeles.

379
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,990
So you got the corpse?

380
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,160
The helicopter landed back at Company headquarters.

381
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,400
You know how important getting rid of him is

382
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,260
to what we're trying to accomplish.

383
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,560
All right, I can still get this done.

384
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,930
Not in our time frame.

385
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,990
All right, I'm pulling the plug.

386
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,330
We need to start dealing with the consequences.

387
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,060
Wait, wait, wait. First things first.

388
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,460
He knows that I've betrayed him.

389
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,560
I need to disappear.

390
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,760
I think that's a good instinct.

391
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,830
I have a house in Sun Valley.

392
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,230
I have another idea.

393
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,660
Do you mind putting me on speaker?

394
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,890
You know, Griff, you're a brave man.

395
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,690
And I thank you for everything you've done.

396
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,660
It's been an honor.

397
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,230
Now.

398
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,400
"Now" what?

399
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,030
The car in this picture has Florida plates.

400
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,430
Did you ever vacation there?

401
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,130
- No.  - Do you know anyone

402
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,400
- from Florida who came up to visit?  - No.

403
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,560
Why did they take this picture in front of that car?

404
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,890
We didn't.

405
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,300
It's been doctored.

406
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,500
I'm not sure about that.

407
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,630
I mean, the lighting, the shadows,

408
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,960
all sync up perfectly.

409
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,500
This is a '78 Zephyr.

410
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,930
Michael was born in '76.

411
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,600
You're the only one who could've picked up on that.

412
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,500
She doctored that for you.

413
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,260
Let's see what else she might've changed.

414
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,230
What's the license plate on that Zephyr?

415
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,690
M-L-K 4-4-1.

416
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,730
Martin Luther King Boulevard intersects with Route 441

417
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,230
about five miles north of here.

418
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,600
Good.

419
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,600
You guys are here. Listen, we're a little outmanned

420
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,460
down in Little Havana. We could use some backup.

421
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,400
We got a lead on the buyer.

422
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,130
Great, what are we waiting for?

423
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,430
- I think I'm going to do this myself.  - No, no.

424
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,300
Come on, let's stay together. We're a team, right?

425
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,330
- I said I got it.  - After our little

426
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,860
special deliveries this morning,

427
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,360
each one of us has an equal stake.

428
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,990
Whoever started this, we're all going to take them out.

429
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,200
The buyer, we think it's Lincoln's mother.

430
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,630
What?

431
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,430
Like I said, I'm doing this myself.

432
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,630
Linc!

433
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,500
If she has Scylla,

434
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,160
she's not just going to hand it over

435
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,990
any more than the General would have.

436
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,200
You don't know that.

437
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,890
We always thought whoever had Scylla

438
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,260
would do what the General did.

439
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,660
Maybe she won't.

440
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,760
Are you serious?

441
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,600
Your mother is a Company agent?

442
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,030
She was.

443
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,400
She might be one of the good guys now.

444
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,760
With all due respect,

445
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,400
I don't think you're in a place where you can make

446
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,030
a clear determination about that.

447
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,130
Listen, this MLK 441 could be nothing.

448
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
But at the church,

449
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,400
there could be Scylla.

450
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,500
If I need you, I'll call.

451
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,560
This should work.

452
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,960
Come on.

453
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,530
Come on.

454
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,400
Christina?

455
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,030
You need to acknowledge that our chance

456
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,690
of success has substantially declined in the last 24 hours.

457
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,400
There are people out looking for us.

458
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,600
We need to start thinking in terms of contingencies.

459
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,430
Just a little while longer, only a few more days.

460
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,300
General Krantz refused to adjust

461
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,960
when there were credible threats against him.

462
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,030
That's the reason we have Scylla now.

463
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,990
Are you honestly comparing me to him?

464
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,930
I understand what you think your role is in all of this,

465
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,560
and I appreciate your efforts.

466
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,990
But if you can't tell the difference

467
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,990
between he and I, perhaps you need to ask

468
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,430
the General for your old job back.

469
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,400
Oh, look.

470
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,790
Here he is. Would you like to take the call?

471
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,930
Jonathan.

472
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,530
Good afternoon, Christina.

473
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,890
It's good to hear your voice.

474
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,330
I assume this means you've retrieved Scylla.

475
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,500
Not yet.

476
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,430
Oh, that's troubling news.

477
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,260
Have any idea where it is?

478
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,890
Where are you, Christina?

479
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,760
Johannes Burg. Where else would I be?

480
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,360
I've had some of my contacts

481
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,130
in your area check on your house.

482
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,600
There's no one home.

483
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,790
Well, of course not. As long as Scylla's in play,

484
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,860
that address is blown.

485
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,360
Where are you, Christina?

486
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,560
I don't like your tone, Jonathan.

487
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,760
Excuse me

488
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,300
if I sound a bit abrasive.

489
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,460
But it's been a while since anyone's tried to kill me.

490
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,330
Oh, my God.

491
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,060
Are you all right? What happened?

492
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,060
Oren.

493
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,630
"Oren"?

494
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,600
We found his body... executed.

495
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,660
I can only assume that he's working with someone.

496
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,560
Someone who doesn't tolerate failure.

497
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,830
Now, where are you, Christina?

498
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,760
You listen to me.

499
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,690
If you're implying that I had anything to do with this...

500
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,890
Where are you?

501
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,730
After everything I given the company

502
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,890
my husband, my children...

503
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,560
I think it's time that we had a sit-down.

504
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,760
- Talk.  - Tell you what.

505
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,330
Why don't you gather up the brain trust

506
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,990
that half-witted daughter and your psychotic mistress?

507
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,860
Why don't you get together and figure out where Scylla is?

508
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,060
Then call me.

509
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,800
Mr. Burrows.

510
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,590
May I escort you to your table?

511
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,330
You haven't changed a bit.

512
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,160
I'm glad you got my message.

513
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,160
I know it wasn't the most straightforward

514
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,630
mode of communication, but I had to be sure it was you.

515
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,590
At least now I know where Michael gets it from.

516
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,360
I'm sure you have many questions.

517
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,290
Where's Scylla?

518
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,230
It's safe.

519
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,130
That's all I can tell you for right now.

520
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,960
Then we've got nothing to talk about.

521
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,730
Really?

522
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,530
That's the only reason you came here?

523
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,160
Yeah.

524
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,000
I really would've thought you wanted to know the truth.

525
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,130
I know the truth.

526
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,460
You work for the Company.

527
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,700
The same people that set me up for murder.

528
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,960
- Lincoln...  - The same people

529
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,000
that have been trying to kill me and Michael

530
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,390
ever since we escaped Fox River.

531
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,860
You can think it as much as you want, I'm not a monster.

532
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,830
23 years and not even an apology?

533
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,030
If I thought an apology would do any good,

534
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,560
I would offer it.

535
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,560
Please.

536
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,630
Please sit down.

537
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,660
Leaving you two boys...

538
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,230
was the hardest thing I ever did.

539
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,260
But you did.

540
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,390
And then you went off and worked for the Company.

541
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,460
You know, you think you know what the Company is,

542
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,530
but you don't.

543
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,230
It is a body that bends

544
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,800
to the will of its head.

545
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,590
And right now, it is bloodthirsty and war-hungry,

546
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,290
because that's who General Krantz is.

547
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,230
But what if a woman,

548
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,960
a mother, ran it?

549
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,430
Can you imagine the different that would make?

550
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,860
You think you're a mother?

551
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,760
A mother's priority

552
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,800
is her family.

553
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,130
If I give Scylla back to the general, he leaves me

554
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,030
and Michael alone, and I get to spend time

555
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,590
with my son in peace.

556
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,760
Look, I could sit here for days and try to explain to you

557
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,900
why I did what I did.

558
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,100
Suffice it to say, I couldn't protect you then,

559
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,100
but let me protect you now.

560
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,930
What if General Krantz were no longer in the picture?

561
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,330
Once he is dealt with,

562
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,760
no one would come after you.

563
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,630
But I need time, Lincoln.

564
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,000
I need two days

565
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,560
to put everything into place.

566
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,460
If you give me two days...

567
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,290
... then I can give you and Michael

568
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,190
your complete and utter freedom.

569
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,190
All right.

570
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,860
All right.

571
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,360
I'm going to get started right away.

572
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,430
But if Krantz suspects any of this,

573
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,530
he's going to hunt us both down.

574
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,430
And for that reason,

575
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,960
I can't risk being seen with you

576
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,800
until all of this is over.

577
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,860
How will I get in touch with you?

578
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,630
You can't.

579
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,290
I'm sorry.

580
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,760
Once we pull this box down,

581
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,000
it'll push the water machine

582
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,490
right through the side door.

583
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,230
We're slowing down. I think we're getting off the highway.

584
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,960
I'm almost ready. Hold on.

585
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,330
Sara, grab that strap over there.

586
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,830
All right, hold it.

587
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,930
Sara, get behind me.

588
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,430
Come on!

589
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,560
Ready?

590
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,460
Jump!

591
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,100
You all right?

592
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,760
After you clear the area

593
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,130
I don't anticipate any problems.

594
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,130
All right?

595
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,260
Scylla or not here we come.

596
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,300
- All right.  - Hold on.

597
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,160
Hold on.

598
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,960
What the hell are those guys doing?

599
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,430
We're not going against any additional people in there.

600
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
We wait until they come

601
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,930
back out.

602
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,330
So Lincoln's mother is really the buyer?

603
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,360
It appears that way.

604
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,630
I hope he understands,

605
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,630
that if I need to take her out to get to Scylla,

606
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,630
I'm not going to hesitate to kill her.

607
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,130
No question.

608
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,090
Well, let's just hope it doesn't come to that.

609
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,330
You serious?

610
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,190
Yeah. Am I serious if we can get Scylla

611
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,360
without killing Linc's mother,

612
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,160
that's the preferable outcome.

613
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,460
Wait a second.

614
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,260
If I'm gonna be in the foxhole with you,

615
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,360
I need to know that you have my back.

616
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,330
Mrs. Burrows has the item,

617
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,760
and the only way to get it is to kill her.

618
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,830
What is your move?

619
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,460
I pull the trigger.

620
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,890
There they go,

621
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,260
come on.

622
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,560
Don Self,

623
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,030
Homeland Security.

624
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,630
We're investigating

625
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,400
a cruelty to animal charge.

626
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,230
I have no idea what you're referring to.

627
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,300
We're referring to ritual

628
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,560
slaughters of chickens.

629
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,230
Okay, that might be allowed where you come from

630
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,960
but here in America, that's no mas.

631
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,660
Chickens?

632
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,660
This is preposterous.

633
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,260
This is because I'm Caribbean?

634
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,260
I swear to God, I smelled

635
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,360
chicken blood. Worse than the place

636
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,700
- down the street we shut down.  - Hey.

637
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,230
You want to turn this into something?

638
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,860
Sit down.

639
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,860
If there aren't any chickens,

640
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,890
there aren't any chickens.

641
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,990
But we're not going to know that

642
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,190
until we take a look around.

643
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,990
The smell was coming from back there.

644
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,890
That is our sanctuary.

645
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,160
I cannot let you to disrupt it.

646
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,230
I understand your concerns, but I need to go back there.

647
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,990
I insist, you cannot do that.

648
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,060
Best I can do is have you accompany us, please.

649
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,160
Please.

650
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,190
You,

651
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,530
come on, let's go outside

652
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,530
until they're done.

653
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Let's go.

654
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,330
That's not a very heavenly thing to do.

655
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,630
Find anything?

656
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,030
Oh, ah.

657
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,360
Wow.

658
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,760
What the hell are they up to?

659
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,460
I don't know.

660
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,560
He just asked to rent that closet.

661
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,260
Did a woman ever come down here with him?

662
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,130
Yeah, once.

663
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,460
I'm telling you,

664
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,790
that's all I know.

665
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,830
Drop it.

666
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,530
Don't.

667
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,990
Come here.

668
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,530
Both of you,

669
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,030
on your knees.

670
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,530
I said on your knees.

671
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,660
I told you not to come in here.

672
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,560
Where's the other guy?

673
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,060
He ran. Let's go.

674
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,830
Let's go.

675
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,230
Are you all right?

676
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,500
Yeah.

677
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,160
Let's go.

678
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,760
We're not going to make it back to the truck.

679
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,190
I know.

680
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,230
Here.

681
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,190
Take this.

682
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,430
I'll be right back.

683
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,460
Michael.

684
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,400
Michael!

685
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,460
You all right?

686
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,660
Yeah, thanks.

687
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,330
The General should know by now not to mess with us.

688
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,300
The General...

689
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,890
didn't send me.

690
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,860
Who did?

691
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,930
Who sent you?

692
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,090
Lincoln!

693
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,560
We've got news.

694
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,730
So do I.

695
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,260
We're staying low for two days.

696
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,760
Christina's promised to get rid of Krantz.

697
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,030
I think she's lying.

698
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,030
I know it sounds crazy,

699
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,860
she said she's going to change the Company

700
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,060
in the way it operates.

701
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,560
So what, the Compa's gonna go nonviolent now?

702
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,860
- Just hear me out.  - I'm telling you. I think she's lying.

703
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,430
It's from the church. Some kind of credential.

704
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
There were some automatic weapons in there, too.

705
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,060
And trust me, if there's fake IDs and weapons

706
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,430
something big's about to go down.

707
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,890
Your mom,

708
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,230
she said after two days,

709
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,600
that's when she would make the change.

710
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,730
Yeah.

711
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,230
Take a look at the date on that laminate,

712
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,990
tow days away.

713
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,630
You think that's just a coincidence? Come on,

714
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,860
Lincoln, you can't be surprised

715
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,530
that a woman that would abandon her kids

716
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,890
would be less than truthful

717
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,600
about her intentions right now.

718
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,560
- Hey, were you going?  - I need to talk to her.

719
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,260
Just take a moment. Let's figure this out.

720
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,890
If she's looking to head the Company,

721
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,960
there has to a more realistic plan than a one-man

722
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,030
frontal assault.

723
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,060
She'll listen to me.

724
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,560
She asked you not to come back, Linc.

725
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,630
That's a warning.

726
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,790
Lincoln's back at the plaza.

727
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,760
I think we need

728
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,230
to realize he's more of a threat

729
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,500
than we gave him credit for.

730
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,890
He found the mansion.

731
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,630
His guys got the stash at the church.

732
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,860
He's not going to stop.

733
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,930
I told him to stay away.

734
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,990
Sir,

735
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,090
Alpha is a go.

736
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,330
Christina,

737
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
we have a clean shot.

738
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,660
Take it.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
