1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,800
previously on prison break:

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,760
Someone at homeland security did an
enhanced image search on you today.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,620
-Who?
-His name is don self.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,550
Yes.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,590
What do you say you give me that
little piece of paper in your hand.

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,790
From now on,I'm asking that everyone
keep their card on them at all times.

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,410
-where's the bird book?
-Bird book?

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,900
Where's the book?

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,080
Someone was following me.

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,550
Is this the guy?

11
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,140
Yeah.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,210
Who's that?

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,260
That's the man who killed my son.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,330
Now he's come to kill us.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,960
Don't get used to it.

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,840
Sparklekid,gate 8.

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,410
Excuse me.

18
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,520
Hi,there. I would like
to place some bets,please.

19
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,830
Uh,I'd like to place an exacta on captain
brody and mister hooper in the first race.

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,130
All righT.

21
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,960
$20,please. Thank you.

22
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,500
I think you made a mistake here.

23
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,200
I wanted a quinella for captain brody
and mister hooper in the first race.

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,070
Uh,you gave me an exacta.

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,640
That's what you told me you wanted.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,030
No,it's not what I told you.
And I want you to fix it!

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,130
Sir,I gave you exactly what you asked.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,110
no,you didn't-- what the
hell kind of place is this?

29
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,730
If you'll just calm down,please.

30
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm not-- calm down? What-what
are you talking about?

31
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,210
I want you to fix this.

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,970
This is-- you gave
me the wrong bet.

33
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,060
I placed a bet on a quinella on doctor
brody and mister hooper in the first race.

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,930
Yo,somebody's freaking out
on one of the clerks inside.

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,490
We'll check it out.

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,170
***

37
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,380
Hey,louis,we've got a
disturbance by the windows.

38
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,920
I'm on my way.

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,260
What the hell kind of
place is this anyway?

40
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,860
If you'll just calm down,please.

41
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,770
I'm not. what,what
are you talking about?

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
I want you to fix this!

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,530
This is-- you gave
me the wrong bet.

44
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,260
I'm not leaving this place
until I talk to the guy.

45
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,500
-Hey,you need to calm down.
-Who the hell are you?

46
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,340
I'm the operations manager,all
right. Take it easy.

47
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,480
Do you run background checks on your
employees or do you just let cons work here?

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,550
Okay,there are no cons
working here,all right?

49
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,840
Look at her. What is she doing?

50
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,950
Ma-mave-mave,do you
have a record,mave?

51
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,480
Excuse me. Sir,hey!

52
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,320
Excuse me,miss.

53
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,690
Oh,my god. Thank you so much.

54
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,520
I would have been in so much
trouble if I'd lost those.

55
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,410
You don't know my boss. He would have
gone up one side of me and down the other.

56
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,980
-Thank you.
-Any time.

57
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,020
Look at her-- why is she
lookin' at me like that?

58
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,920
Let's not yell at anyone,all
right? We'll take care of it.

60
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,480
I'm not yelling at anyone.

61
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,870
Oh,sorry,sir.

62
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,890
I'll keep an eye on the monitors.

63
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,030
He's heading back.

64
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,950
Let's go.

65
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,020
-How's it look?
-I'm getting a clear signal. We're all set.

66
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,620
Cardholder number four,you're up.

67
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,410
Here you go,darling.

68
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,940
Yeah. Thanks.

69
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,120
The clocker said sparklekid was
edging on the track record at prep.

70
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,110
Oh,that's great,honey.

71
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,980
T's go.

72
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,570
They're up! Good
afternoon,ladies and gentlemen

73
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,760
and welcome to the first race
of the day here at los alamitos.

74
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,300
The starters are at the gate.

75
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,540
and we're ready to go.

76
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,260
and they're off and running.

77
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,280
What the hell?

78
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,460
Oh,we have a stall! It's
stuck,it's stuck. The gate's stuck.

79
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,760
I'll go talk to the manager.

-I need to see the manager.
-Yes,sir.

84
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,440
It'S.

85
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,410
you better have a damn good
explanation about what just happened.

86
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,980
All right,I'll get back to you.

87
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,700
We're looking into it
right now,Mr. Edison.

88
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,920
Cue up the tape. Now.

89
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,060
We've made contact. 15% and counting.

90
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,650
Right there,it's stuck.

91
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,780
-What happened to his gate? I
-I don't know.

92
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,110
-Lewis you better come down here.
-Not now.

93
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,690
We found something on gate 8
where sparklekid was placed.

94
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,740
I'll be right back.

95
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,660
I'm coming with you.

96
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,590
Did we get it?

97
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,050
100% we're all there. Card's all there.

98
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,980
You've never jerked a loser before.

99
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,770
'S all your fault!

100
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,930
We're gonna need some backup.

101
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,020
Here come the cops. You better
go before you get recognized.

102
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,040
-Someone has to be lookout.
-I'll take care of it. Go!

103
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,080
Go!

104
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
All right,break it up,guys.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,230
Let's go!

106
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,780
Hi,there. Um,excuse me.

107
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,490
I was wondering if you could help me.

108
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,320
I placed a bet on
sparklekid for my boss.

109
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,410
Do you know what happened?

110
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,020
Not right now,sweetheart.

111
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,860
Okay.

112
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,630
My boss had me put more money
on him than I make in a week.

113
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,590
Um,he's gonna flip out
when I tell him about this.

114
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,730
I'm really not the right person to ask.

115
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,590
Okay,but,here,i put $500 here
for orca's revenge. Maybe I could.

116
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,070
you're gonna have to talk
to one of the window clerks.

117
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,250
But maybe I could add it to that?

118
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,120
Look,I-I can't help you,all right?

119
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,130
Now,move it along,honey.

120
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,080
Okay,um,listen.

121
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,710
I'm just trying to ask
you a couple questions.

122
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,900
Yeah,well,you asked one too many.

123
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,410
How about this?

124
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,040
Why don't you help me find somebody
who could help me sort all this out?

125
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,760
How's that?

126
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,070
If you don't take your hands off me you're gonna
have a lot more to worry about than an angry boss.

127
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,700
All right,well,um.

128
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,700
you take good care of
yourself today,officer.

129
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,490
Excuse me?

130
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,660
This is a restricted area,sir.
You can't be back here.

131
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,720
Yeah,I'm looking for a manager
because I'm getting the money back

132
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,760
that I bet on the horse
that got stuck in the gate.

133
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,000
Did you see that one? Yeah.

134
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,420
I said you can't be back here!

135
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,990
I need back up.

136
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,710
where's mahone?

137
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,530
He's right there.

138
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,400
That's great. He's got the device.

139
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,770
We're screwed.

141
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,320
Mommy?

142
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,360
Go back to your
room,okay,sweetheart. Okay.

143
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,180
Oh,my god.

144
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,910
What happened to you?

145
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,200
Hey,sis.

146
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,630
***

147
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,330
we have an issue.

148
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,980
Good afternoon to you,too,andy.

149
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,130
I've been reviewing your roster
from the northeast division,

150
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,920
and apparently two of your top buyers
don't have valid social security numbers.

151
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,750
Care to explain that?

152
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,540
when I'm about to make
a sale to a client,

153
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,040
I ask myself two questions:
"Is the client being helped?

154
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,570
" And,"are we gettin' paid?

155
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,920
" There's a reason why I was
the top seller in the northeast.

156
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,280
I don't get hung up on the details.

157
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,560
And what you're saying is.

158
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,560
there might be a typo
or two in my reports,

159
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,080
but I'm pretty sure
those checks cleared.

160
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,030
Fair enough.

161
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,510
***

162
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,350
you've had a busy morning,frank.

163
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,030
Unlawful entry,resisting arrest.

164
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,300
It's not even lunchtime.

165
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,310
You're trying to put
the fear of god into me.

166
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,500
mission accomplished.

167
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,440
Listen,sergeant,I know a decent
amount about the justice system,

168
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,130
enough to know that if you wanted
to,you could drop this whole thing and.

169
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,020
it would save a lot of
trouble for everybody,huh?

170
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,780
What kind of phone is this?

171
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,680
It's a,a japanese brand. Off market.

172
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,320
What about the ankle
monitor you're wearing?

173
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,280
I've been on the straight and narrow,and
it's due to come off in a couple of days.

174
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,740
Press your fingers in the ink.

175
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,140
I had two grand go up in
smoke because of a bum gate.

176
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,580
I mean,I got a little
upset for a second.

177
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,480
You know what I mean? Who wouldn't?

178
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,220
let's talk about this.

179
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,760
Should we talk about how
you punched an officer first?

180
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,850
Or how you tried to flee the scene?

181
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,740
Pick a felony.

182
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,530
Take him to the holding cell.

183
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,090
Self : What do you mean he
got arrested? W-what happened?

184
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,690
It's a long story,but we need you
to get mahone and the device out.

185
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,810
Can you do that?

186
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,520
What,what do you think,that
every time you guys screw up,

187
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,890
I can just magically
make things disappear?

188
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,780
We ain't interested in your excuses.

189
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,000
Can you do it or not?

190
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,060
Lincoln,y-you know
what? I'll call you back.

191
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,330
Excuse me. Who are you? What is this?

192
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm brian. I work in the it department.

193
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,910
We were getting some registry
inconsistencies on the server,so.

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,620
I'm just running a few
routine spot checks.

195
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,530
So you just barge in
here without asking?

196
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,950
I have level two clearance. See?

197
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,110
It's what I do. I go into people's
offices,I fix their computers.

198
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,640
I just figured it was better
to do it when you weren't here.

199
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,970
Well,you know what? You got to go.

200
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,870
Don't come back in here.

201
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,820
Sure thing. You're all set.

202
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,220
So what's the word?

203
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,140
Self's on it.

204
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,420
On it,as in he's getting mahone out?

205
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,640
He said he'd handle it.

206
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,770
What's there to handle?

207
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,880
Self yanked us all out of
prison for way bigger charges.

208
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,510
Getting mahone out should
be easy,shouldn't it?

209
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,930
Yeah.

210
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,840
Let's concentrate on
finding the next cardholder.

211
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,320
As soon as we get the device
back,we'll move forward.

212
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,450
Would you please walk us
through what we know so far?

213
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,820
Sure.

214
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,210
Howard scuderi runs agrisow,which is the
world's largest agricultural conglomerate.

215
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,130
It actually has huge holdings in laos,

216
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,480
which,given the current inflation,means
that they are making money hand over fist.

217
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,420
"My friends are playing at the park.

218
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,600
" Sweetheart,why don't you go play
in your room for a little bit,okay?

219
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,300
How are you feeling?

220
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,040
Better.

221
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,150
I,I made you a sandwich.

222
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,090
Thank you.

223
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,820
Um,you never explained what happened.

224
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,910
Well,um.

225
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,700
my car broke down in the
middle of the desert,and,uh.

226
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,490
there was no one around for
miles,and my cell phone was dead,

227
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,120
so I walked here.

228
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,370
Hey,do you still have that
owl that I sent from germany?

229
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,680
Yeah.

230
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,940
-I need to see it.
-Okay.

231
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,590
Thank you.

232
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,030
Oh,my god,gretchen!

233
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,980
Is that,is that,that a real gun?

234
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,310
It is.

235
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,470
You don't work for the irs?

236
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,070
I don'T.

237
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,470
Who do you work for?

238
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,310
As of now?

239
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,700
Myself.

240
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,950
He attended touro law
school in long island.

241
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,170
He spent the next 18 years
bouncing around the D.O.J.And D.O.D.

242
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,120
Before being dumped on the
doorstep of homeland in '02.

243
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,900
come in.

244
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,270
General.

245
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,290
What did you find out?

246
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,140
I tried accessing self's user account,

247
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,570
but he has a tricky
firewall system in place.

248
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,160
There's no easy way to
get past it,not without.

249
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,540
drawing attention.

250
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,770
So we still don't know
why he's interested in me.

251
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,880
maybe if you gave me more time.

252
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,380
I'll look into it.

253
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,370
Look,he's important to me.
Okay,he's doing a job for me.

254
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,470
-Yeah,well,your ci punched one of my officers in the face.
-I understand.

255
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,320
you're lucky he's not
being charged with worse.

256
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,970
I apologize for him. Okay?

257
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,420
Look,I-I'm asking for a favor
here,okay,from one badge to another.

258
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,530
When was the last time
you looked at your badge?

259
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,250
'Cause I'm pretty sure mine says
"issued by the city of los angeles,"

260
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,860
not the federal government,so
unless you get a court order that.

261
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,220
hey,hey! You want to go that
route? You want to get smart?

262
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,800
Want to get detained at the guadalajara airport
when you're coming back from visiting your nana?

263
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,020
How does that sound?

264
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,130
You ever hear of a no-fly list?

265
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,990
That's what my badge could do. Okay?

266
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,850
Want to see what else it could do?

267
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,710
I was starting to worry.

268
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,980
-Sign these.
-Yeah.

269
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,760
these aren't release papers.

270
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,330
Well,I need you to sign that
so I can collect your personal.

271
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,840
they're gonna run my
prints,and once they.

272
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,020
-you punched a cop.
-Yeah,trying to save the mission.

273
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,960
Keep your voice down. Okay?

274
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,520
I did the best I could do.

275
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,920
You need to sign those so I
can collect roland's device.

276
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,640
You.

277
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,810
you want me to give up the one thing
that makes me valuable to the team.

278
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,900
Yeah,you knew the deal
when you came on board.

279
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,340
Okay,we all sacrificed
a lot to get this far.

280
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,950
You want to flush it down the
toilet because you made a bad move?

281
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,450
got it.

282
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,670
Self got the device.
Mahone's still in jail.

283
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,230
But mahone-- he-he's
part of the team.

284
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,820
Was.

285
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,590
Look,I feel just as bad about
his kid as everyone else,

286
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,600
but we can't blow this
mission on one person.

287
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,420
Oh,yeah?

288
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,000
So if I get popped tomorrow,you guys
are just going to forget about me?

289
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,800
Yeah.

290
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,960
Hey,listen.

291
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,100
An assassin is trying
to hunt us down,okay?

292
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,190
And that t-bag character is out in
the wind with the keys to the castle.

293
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,070
We got enough problems without having
to worry about this guy's ass in jail.

294
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,980
You shut up.

295
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:52,950
Okay.

296
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,860
Alex has an alias,but if they run his
prints, they're gonna find out that he'S.

297
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,410
not if-- when they
run his prints,

298
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,190
they're going to figure out who he is and that
he's not in a supermax like he's supposed to be,

299
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,390
and then they're gonna
realize we're not.

300
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,430
michael.

301
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,420
Linc's right.

302
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,590
We don't have a choice. We
move forward with the plan.

303
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,080
***

304
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,680
agent self.

305
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,040
I'm an associate of general krantz.

306
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,290
Word has gotten back to the general that
you've been pulling information on him.

307
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,990
Why is that,Mr. Self?

308
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,630
I'm homeland security.

309
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,800
It's my job to protect people who
make attractive terrorist targets--

310
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,440
people in upper ranks of
military,people like krantz.

311
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,280
Is there a particular
threat I should know about?

312
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,620
Maybe you can debrief
me on the situation.

313
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,210
What's your division?

314
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,340
You want to give me
your clearance level?

315
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,980
I'm A.

316
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,590
hired contractor.

317
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,670
right.

318
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:34,110
Well,I usually don't make a habit of giving civilians who corner
me in underground parking structures classified information.

319
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,980
Okay? So if the general has
a problem,he can call me.

320
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,290
Is there something else
you want to say to me?

321
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,220
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

322
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm just here to give you
a little friendly advice.

323
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,810
What's that?

324
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,150
The general-- he
likes his privacy.

325
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,950
That's all.

326
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,170
Yes,so that was wyatt.

327
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,630
I gotta tell you,I'm not a big fan of
almost catching a bullet in my head.

328
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Well,now you know what it's like.

329
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,410
So,how well do you know mahone?

330
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,940
I know he wants to take down the
company just as much as we do.

331
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,630
You also realize he's a major liability.

332
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,930
I mean,if wyatt could find
me,he could find mahone.

333
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,950
- And then people.
- so get him out.

334
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,460
I told you I can'T.

335
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,030
But I can get to him.

336
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,690
I mean,he can be touched.

337
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,140
I don't know,maybe
mahone is a stand-up guy.

338
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,420
Or maybe he likes to run his mouth
to work an angle,I'm not sure.

339
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,610
But if need be,I can
get rid of that angle.

340
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,780
I can eliminate that threat.

341
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,280
That's not an option.

342
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,160
Oh,yes it is.

343
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,990
Okay,because if a choice has
to be made between him or us.

344
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,480
hey,frank.Got some good news.

345
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,130
Oh,yeah,what's that?

346
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,210
I can cut you a break.

347
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,000
As easy as that?

348
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,040
Spoke with the manager
down at the racetrack.

349
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:47,160
Said you were spotted with another male
caucasian about ten years your junior.

350
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,870
That sound about right?

351
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,810
Here come the cops.

352
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,230
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

353
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,570
What was it?

354
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,260
The two of you were gonna
go in there,rob the vault?

355
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,110
Grab as much cash and get out?

356
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,740
Someone has to be lookout.I'll
take care of it.Go!

357
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,990
Look.

358
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,950
Maybe you got a wife to get home to.

359
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,460
Family.

360
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,400
If you're willing to give me the name of your
accomplice I think we can change your charges.

361
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,730
I thought we worked together,you
know.Help each other out.

362
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,700
You're on your own.

363
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,190
You holler if you change your minD.

364
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,690
All right,let's talk
about the fifth cardholder.

365
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,020
The general is requiring all the cardholders
to have their cards on them at all times,

366
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,970
so scuderi will have his card,too.

367
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,360
Now,scuderi has major
security around his house.

368
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,210
Big fence,lots of guard dogs.

369
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,340
- Where are the documents?
- These are from the county surveyor's office.

370
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:48,360
It shows the layout of his property,and its
proximity to every other house on his street.

371
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:55,520
He has-- surprise,surprise-- a top of the line electronic alarm
system that will alert him if there's a breach in the structure.

372
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,560
If we cut the power--
the alarm goes off.

373
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,730
If we double the power with a
voltage spike the alarm system,

374
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,660
in order to protect itself against
an overload,will shut itself down.

375
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,860
And that's how we're getting in.

376
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,070
Then what?

377
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,500
Look,I know what the score
is.It's every man for himself.

378
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,860
You get left behind you get locked up.

379
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,200
Tough titties.

380
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,570
Now,I signed on the dotted line like everyone else
and I want to know exactly what I'm doing on this job.

381
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,590
I'm with bellick on this one.

382
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,310
You know,maybe we should have a plan for when
the cops get here 'cause if mahone squeals

383
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,860
they're gonna come real quick.

384
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,100
He's a fed-- how many deals do you
think this guy's made in his life?

385
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,080
- You think he's just gonna tuck tail between his.
- shut up.

386
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,300
Look,we can sit here and debate what mahone
is or is not gonna do for the rest of the day,

387
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,100
but it comes down to this: We cannot
break him out of a police station.

388
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:54,430
1 2 3 4 5 6 no

389
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,040
Too big.

390
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,630
1  2 3 4 5

391
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,230
eight by ten.

392
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,170
This is the lowest gauge I could get.

393
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,860
It's perfect.Cool.

394
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,090
Well.

395
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,350
I guess,uh.

396
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,840
I guess we're gonna leave him in jail.

397
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,370
Is that a statement or a question?

398
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,700
It's just if something
happens to alex-- if,uh,

399
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,290
if the company finds him.

400
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,810
if the roles were reversed
and you were the one locked up,

401
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,010
you really think alex would
risk it all to get you out?

402
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,450
I mean,I don't know.

403
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,270
But.he was a federal agent.I
think he'd finish what he started.

404
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,460
I think he'd bring the company down.

405
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,040
Can I help you with something?

406
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,790
Yes,I-I'm here to see frank zwan.

407
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,370
I'm a family friend.

408
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,210
I'm afraid you can't see him right now.

409
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,950
He's about to be transferred
for his arraignment.

410
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,900
Actually,I'd like to be
there.for moral support.

411
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,110
Could you tell me which courthouse?

412
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,330
Hello?

413
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,570
Michael.

414
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,650
Alex,look,I'm sorry.

415
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,330
He found me.

416
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,230
Wyatt-- he showed up at the station
house where they're holding me.

417
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,550
I don't know how he did it.

418
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,920
I don't know how he figured it out.

419
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,130
Let me call agent self.

420
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,200
- No,michael,listen.
- no,maybe he can get you moved.

421
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,700
It's-it's over for me.It's done.

422
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,910
It's-- and I'm not gonna
say anything about anything.

423
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,570
But you need to promise
me something,okay?

424
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,890
Okay,what?

425
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,740
Promise me.

426
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,700
that you will get to wyatt and
you'll kill the son of a bitch.

427
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:25,180
And then you'll call pam and
you'll tell her that he's gone.

428
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,860
All right.

429
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,560
I promise.

430
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,280
Okay.

431
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,820
Okay.All right.

432
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,740
You ready to go?

433
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,860
Michael?I'm his wife.

434
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,270
I'm sorry,I'm-I'm still in shock.

435
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,020
I'll be down this afternoon.

436
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,370
Thank you.

437
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,030
Who are you?

438
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,870
I just have some things
I need to take care of.

439
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,910
You don't need to worry.

440
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,070
You have this.

441
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,330
switch inside you.

442
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,510
I don't know how you could
just.shut yourself off.

443
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,650
You did it when mom died.

444
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,810
Did it with emily.

445
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,450
Did it with me.

446
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,580
I do it because it'S.

447
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,980
it's just who I am.

448
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,920
No,it's not.

449
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,490
- You used to be.
- I have to go.

450
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,610
But thank you.

451
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,560
for everything.

452
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,850
So,you're not here to take her?

453
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,130
If I was capable of being her mother,I
wouldn't have given you custody.

454
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,770
You be a good girl,okay?

455
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,070
Bye,emily.

456
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,120
Bye,auntie.

457
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,000
I love you.

458
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,980
Will we see you again?

459
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,200
I don't know.

460
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,590
Call me if it goes south.

461
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,070
To listen to your messages press.

462
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,770
***********

463
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,400
I was planning to make those grilled pork
chops,unless you're not in the mood for them.

464
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,390
I hope you're having a great day.

465
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,940
Hey,what are you guys doing?

466
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,940
We'll call you when we're done.

467
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,570
Wait.

468
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,400
Where are you guys?

469
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,310
We're almost ready.

470
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,470
- you have a problem.
- What's that?

471
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,420
what can i do you for?

472
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,880
I just-- I've found some more
inconsistencies in your sales reports.

473
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,690
Actually,many more.

474
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,650
In fact.

475
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,330
kind of looks like fraud,actually.

476
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,530
I knew you were rotten
from the beginning.

477
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,730
I want you in my office in five
minutes to walk me through this,

478
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:00,390
and if you can't,well,I'm
gonna call the authorities.

479
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,280
what are you doing?

480
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,920
Nice knowing you,sugar.

481
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,770
Cole,wait.

482
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,020
I was traveling abroad
when he passed away.

483
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,840
Again,I'm very sorry.

484
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,160
Is this your husband?

485
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,220
Yes.

486
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:52,110
I need to see some identification so I can
sign over his personal belongings to you.

487
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,430
So...you and your spouse
had different last names?

488
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,870
That's correct.

489
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,690
I realize this is an inconvenience,but I need to
see other documentation proving you were married.

490
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,360
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

491
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,640
I'm sorry,ma'am.

492
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,630
Rules are rules.

493
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,820

instahomes getting back to you.

if you did it for me,and.

515
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,020
I don't care.

00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,860
I just.

517
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,760

518
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,840
- yes.
- I got your message.

519
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,170
I was wondering when
you were going to call.

520
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,360
You told my wife you
wanted me to turn myself in.

521
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:24,110
So,uh,why don't you tell me
where to go and I'll meet you?

522
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,580
Let's get this over with.

523
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,830
This thing is far from over,alex.

524
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:35,020
First I find sara
tancredi here,then you.

525
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,860
Seems like there's a great deal
of things for us to talk about.

526
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,390
Oh,no.No,no,no.

527
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,670
There's only one thing
for you and I to discuss.

528
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,700
You worked for the company once,alex.

529
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,680
You should know better than
to take things so personally.

530
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:57,610
I'm gonna wrap this up,just in case you
decided to trace this call,but I promise you.

I'm going to show you just
how personal things can get.

00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,290
Oh,yeah.
