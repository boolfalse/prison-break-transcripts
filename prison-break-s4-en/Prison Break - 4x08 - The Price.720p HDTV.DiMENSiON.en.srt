1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,173
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,183 --> 00:00:05,749
If Scylla was like a pizza, all we got is a slice.

3
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:07,652
So Scylla isn't one card.

4
00:00:07,913 --> 00:00:09,205
It's six.

5
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:11,028
How long has it been happening?

6
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:12,020
It's not a big deal.

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,472
It was a big deal when you were 13.

8
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:14,925
Michael told you about mom?

9
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:17,850
No. As a kid, she got nosebleeds.

10
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,623
In her 30s, they started up again.

11
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,376
How old was your mom when she passed away?

12
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:24,471
31. Michael's just turning 31.

13
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:26,584
Who's that?

14
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:28,628
That's the man that killed my son.

15
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:32,094
Yes?

16
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,570
It's like a digital Black hole.

17
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,244
It swallows up any electronic data within ten feet.

18
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:47,039
Mr. Glenn?

19
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,321
We got a problem.

20
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:49,854
What's that do?

21
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:50,625
It's a battery pack

22
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:51,998
For a video game console.

23
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,043
You'll need to buy a new one.

24
00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:58,789
Scylla. Get it to me by tomorrow

25
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,213
And you will receive 50% of the fee.

26
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:03,687
Two Days, 25%.

27
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:04,960
Three Days,

28
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,642
I shoot you through the brain.

29
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,292
Who is this?

30
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,925
Hello, Michael.

31
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:28,219
You know what?

32
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,343
If crab ever throws a psycho at us like this again,

33
00:01:30,353 --> 00:01:31,695
I'm going to kill him.

34
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:34,580
Yeah, but if we Don't get this psycho, crab's going to kill us.

35
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,142
Just have the burner ready.

36
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:38,076
Got it covered.

37
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:43,064
After this job, I'm Done, man.

38
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:44,937
I can't do this anymore.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,113
What do you think crab will say about that?

40
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:50,086
I Don't care what crab says about that.

41
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:53,211
How can I be a good father if I'm always in prison?

42
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:56,096
I missed out on my kid's childhood.

43
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:58,841
I'm not going to miss out on him becoming a man.

44
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:03,309
You know, not for nothing, but this plan is crazy even for you.

45
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:05,212
You sure this is the only way?

46
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:06,364
Yeah.

47
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:09,689
Hey look. He's coming out.

48
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,042
He's got the case.

49
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:15,319
Let's buckle up.

50
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,410
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!

51
00:02:58,352 --> 00:02:59,434
You're welcome.

52
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:00,646
Let's go!

53
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,033
So wait a minute. This is your brilliant plan?

54
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,099
You're going to pull a kamikaze mission on the general's car?

55
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,493
Now that the device is gone,

56
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,226
Your opinion doesn't matter.

57
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:20,159
So shut up and pump.

58
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:23,354
We know the general travels light.

59
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:24,757
One limo and a couple of guards.

60
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,511
It ain't the guards I'm worried about; it's the crash.

61
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,485
Look, I never said this was going to be easy.

62
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:44,791
Just relax.

63
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:51,983
First off, Panama was a job.

64
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:53,215
Some other Time.

65
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:54,607
What do you want with Scylla?

66
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:55,629
That's my business.

67
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,342
We're not in Panama anymore,

68
00:03:57,352 --> 00:03:59,696
And I'm not behind a fence, so, again,

69
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,868
What do you want with Scylla?

70
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:02,220
Same thing you want.

71
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,422
Bring down the Company.

72
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:04,725
Great. Then why Don't you

73
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:06,508
Give me those missing pages and disappear?

74
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:08,281
I'd love to. You remember that Day

75
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,735
At the Roosevelt when Whistler made off with Lief's card?

76
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:13,229
Who do you think took the fall for that?

77
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,553
Our names are at the Top of the Same hit list.

78
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,596
Now, I Don't know what arrangement you two have,

79
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:19,059
But I need some traveling money.

80
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,201
Let's talk about that later.

81
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:21,533
Why Don't we talk about the kind of scum

82
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:22,905
You're willing to put on the payroll?

83
00:04:22,915 --> 00:04:25,159
Give me a way to do it without her, and we'll do it.

84
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,852
We need the pages.

85
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:30,028
It's a package deal.

86
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:31,781
Are we partners?

87
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:37,250
Partners.

88
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,851
Look, I barely dropped a nickel in the slots, right?

89
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:50,973
This guy was all...

90
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:52,055
We ought to blanket party

91
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:53,748
Your ass. Where's the device?

92
00:04:53,758 --> 00:04:56,192
Can it be salvaged? Tell him.

93
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,872
Pit boss walked off with it.

94
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,748
Okay. Well, we're going to call this your early retirement.

95
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:07,000
You can either go upstairs

96
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,454
And sit on your cot and ride ut the rest of this thing,

97
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:10,727
Or I can call agent Self

98
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:13,121
And you can ride out the rest of your prison sentence.

99
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:14,433
Your choice.

100
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,003
I need to talk to you.

101
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:38,233
So your brother told me about your nosebleeds.

102
00:05:38,644 --> 00:05:39,946
And he told me about your mom.

103
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:41,228
That wasn't his place.

104
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:43,212
To be worried about you? When mom got sick,

105
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:46,357
Linc was at the hospital every Day, holding her hand,

106
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,222
Watching her die, and he was 13.

107
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:51,806
It changed him. It made him overprotective.

108
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:52,698
And now he's jumping

109
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,720
To all the wrong conclusions

110
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,791
For all the wrong reasons,

111
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:56,584
And it's... It's over nothing because

112
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:57,977
I'm fine.

113
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,132
You Don't look fine.

114
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:05,219
Well, maybe that's because

115
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:06,972
There's something I have to tell you.

116
00:06:10,618 --> 00:06:12,141
Gretchen's alive.

117
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:56,827
She's working with t-bag,

118
00:06:56,837 --> 00:06:59,411
And they have several pages from Whistler's bird book,

119
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,625
And they want in on Scylla.

120
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,271
Self is cutting them a deal as we speak.

121
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:10,460
Self knows that they have their own agenda,

122
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,361
But so do we

123
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:13,275
And as soon as we get those pages back,

124
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:15,819
Gretchen and t-bag are going to pay for everything.

125
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:18,213
They're going to get exactly what's coming to them.

126
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:25,395
Okay.

127
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:27,699
This isn't about Gretchen.

128
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:28,891
It's not about any one person.

129
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:31,465
And we... We have to finish it.

130
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:38,227
I need a minute.

131
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,522
Please.

132
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:24,065
I can't believe this!

133
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:25,617
What choice do we have?

134
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:26,849
Gretchen's on the team.

135
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:27,701
Like it or not,

136
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,955
We need those pages. Another perra

137
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:31,097
We're jumping in bed with?

138
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:32,629
Not exactly new territory for us.

139
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,312
I Don't care who we gotta partner up with.

140
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:36,035
We get those papers, we make with the break-in,

141
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:37,327
We get this job Done.

142
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:39,401
She could still have ties to the Company, man. I Don't know.

143
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:41,494
We'll worry about Gretchen when the Time is right.

144
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,169
For now, let's focus on the general.

145
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:49,558
This thing with Gretchen doesn't change a thing.

146
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,661
We're, uh...

147
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:52,974
We're still close.

148
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:56,319
Closer to Scylla, farther from Wyatt.

149
00:08:57,802 --> 00:08:59,004
You Don't know that.

150
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:00,597
Just stay focused, all right?

151
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,269
This is my focus, okay?

152
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:05,355
I'm doing the job, okay? All right? All right?

153
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:08,250
Every Day, the trail to my son's killer gets a little bit colder.

154
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,397
That's all I do is focus.

155
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,582
What are you doing?

156
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,377
Um... It's just... Uh...

157
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:32,150
We're going to need that downstairs.

158
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:35,446
Yeah. I'll just, uh... Be up here.

159
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:57,353
Message sent.

160
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,639
How much for Scofield and Burrows?

161
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:42,049
I see you two have come to an agreement.

162
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,792
She's on work release,

163
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:45,635
Just like you.

164
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,578
What kind of work?

165
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:49,732
You and the secretary keep things quiet in the office

166
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:51,435
While Michael tunnels to Scylla.

167
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,380
You really think

168
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,283
Scofield's gonna keep his word, huh?

169
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:00,200
You horsewhipped the woman he loves.

170
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,473
Michael wants Scylla just as badly as we do.

171
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:04,206
Yeah, he wanted out of prison, too.

172
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:07,622
Our partnership lasted long enough for that to happen,

173
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:09,736
And then... We parted ways.

174
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:10,828
Trust me.

175
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,282
Yeah, um, go on in, sir.

176
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:15,315
Scofield will use you

177
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,269
And then he's gonna bury the knife in your back

178
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,364
For what you did to his lady friend. Mr. Pfeiffer. Cole.

179
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:24,871
Where's Scylla?

180
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:27,867
Good morning to you, too, sir.

181
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:29,509
Gentlemen.

182
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,232
I gave you three Days.

183
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:32,825
Where's Scylla?

184
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:39,917
I...

185
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:42,672
Now, uh, mr. Feng, let's not do anything rash.

186
00:11:44,014 --> 00:11:45,416
So you're Feng.

187
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:48,131
We haven't actually met in person.

188
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,974
I was the liaison between the Company and your

189
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:52,428
Chinese employers on operation copperhead.

190
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:55,393
Susan?

191
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:56,766
That's right.

192
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:58,949
You went from working for the Company

193
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,333
To stealing the one thing that could destroy them.

194
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:02,666
That's a tight turn.

195
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:04,409
With a price that Scylla commands on the open market,

196
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:05,691
Anybody would turn.

197
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,405
Which is, by the way, 200.

198
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:15,177
Our paths never crossed on copperhead,

199
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:17,691
But I did deal with one of your colleagues;

200
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:19,825
A less-capable associate.

201
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:22,649
Whatever happened to him?

202
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,514
He was skinned and hung from an overpass.

203
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:27,648
Oh, yes, I recall.

204
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,282
He couldn't deliver on promises made.

205
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,117
You may also recall that he was my predecessor.

206
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,391
When I joined copperhead, you got what you wanted.

207
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,944
You'll get Scylla, too.

208
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:39,528
If I Don't,

209
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:43,345
I'll peel you like a wet grape.

210
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:45,388
And the price is 100.

211
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,660
150.

212
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:51,248
125. Don't disappoint me.

213
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,337
Well, 125...

214
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:03,509
Million.

215
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:05,773
Well, then,

216
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,926
Susan, Gretchen, whatever your name is,

217
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,891
I suggest you find a way to bury the hatchet

218
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:13,025
With Michael Scofield's woman.

219
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,078
We got work to do.

220
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,000
Why do I get the feeling that some poor bastard woke up

221
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,593
To an empty driveway this morning?

222
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:31,627
Relax, we got it from a scrap yard.

223
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:32,829
And you're pinning the hopes

224
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,092
Of the entire mission on that relic?

225
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:36,875
If it was card one, I'd say no.

226
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:37,967
If this was card five,

227
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:39,981
I'd say no, but it's the last card.

228
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:41,984
I really think we can stage a hit-and-run

229
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:43,276
And get away with it.

230
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:48,114
All right, we know where this guy works.

231
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:50,108
We know his route.

232
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,712
I'm gonna wait for him at this intersection.

233
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:54,275
He drives through.

234
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:56,599
I smash him with my car, get the card.

235
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:59,394
And if by some miracle you walked away from the crash,

236
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:01,137
The general's gonna know that you ripped him off.

237
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:03,290
Not if I pump him full of morphine first.

238
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,133
The general's gonna wake up tomorrow morning in the hospital

239
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:07,517
Feeling happy as a clam with no idea what happened to him.

240
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:08,369
When he's out cold,

241
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,282
We download the card onto the laptop

242
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:11,564
And put the original back on him.

243
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,257
And you Don't think this is gonna look suspicious

244
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:14,860
For the paramedics that show up at the scene?

245
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,763
That depends on who the paramedics are.

246
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,746
At the federal impound lot downtown,

247
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:21,171
There are currently four ambulances seized

248
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:22,833
In a drug-smuggling ring.

249
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:24,196
All we need is one.

250
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:26,389
Go make yourself useful.

251
00:14:29,895 --> 00:14:32,860
Time was commanders would assemble their troops

252
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,438
Before a battle and rehearse schemes of maneuver

253
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:42,206
On a square of dirt using rocks to depict enemy positions.

254
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:45,412
They called these rehearsals "rock drills."

255
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:50,220
Laos was our rock drill. Now...

256
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:53,706
...It's Time for the battle to commence.

257
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:56,290
Griffin.

258
00:14:57,122 --> 00:14:59,966
Flooding the laotian market with counterfeit kip

259
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:01,439
Was highly effective.

260
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:04,234
In phase two, the effect will take longer,

261
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:08,250
But the result will inevitably be the Same.

262
00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:11,536
I'm signing off on the order to open up

263
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:13,700
The next theater of operations.

264
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:19,950
Excuse me.

265
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,844
The message is untraceable.

266
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:30,348
Someone went to a lot of trouble

267
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:31,881
To cover their tracks.

268
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:36,308
How do we know this person can deliver the brothers?

269
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:37,600
We Don't.

270
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:40,826
Bait the hook.

271
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:42,428
See if he bites.

272
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:54,940
Hey-hey, my friend!

273
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,332
Who the hell are you?

274
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:58,916
Don Self, homeland security.

275
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,341
Phil Stroger.

276
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,593
How's it going? Good.

277
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:03,745
This is a grande.

278
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,267
This thing cost me nine bucks.

279
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:08,072
You california types and your gourmet coffee.

280
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:09,665
Hey, can I help you with something?

281
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:13,030
This is a federal impound lot, correct?

282
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,722
Yeah.

283
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:17,047
Okay, I think it's pretty obvious, Phil, I need a car.

284
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:46,056
So you told Sara about the nosebleeds, huh?

285
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:46,988
I'm worried about you.

286
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:47,799
Well, why Don't you stop

287
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:49,492
Starting fires that I have to put out?

288
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:51,426
Mom couldn't outrun this. What makes you think you...?

289
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:53,349
It's not mom, all right? That was 20 years ago.

290
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:56,484
This is different. It's totally different.

291
00:17:04,738 --> 00:17:05,850
Get in.

292
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:10,528
So my section chief comes over to the rookie's stretcher

293
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:13,553
And he goes, "you got one hell of a workman's comp claim, kid."

294
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,471
Hey, uh, let's get that trip ticket started.

295
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:19,543
Looks like I can hook you up

296
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:21,637
With a Sedan for your stakeout.

297
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:24,812
You know what, Phil? I gotta go.

298
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:26,565
What are you talking about?

299
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:27,367
I just remembered.

300
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:29,440
I got to give a briefing to a bunch of higher-ups.

301
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,281
Can I come back

302
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,443
For the Sedan?

303
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,886
Suit yourself, self.

304
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:36,963
I'll be back.

305
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:41,090
Don Self.

306
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,173
I need you to deliver a message.

307
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:45,067
Okay.

308
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:55,634
I see your boyfriend's no longer sporting

309
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:58,960
The latest fashion in gps technology.

310
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:02,015
So, if neither one of you are wearing ankle monitors,

311
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:03,418
What are you still doing here?

312
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:05,070
You should be having hot fugitive sex

313
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:07,034
In every cash only no-tell motel

314
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,116
From here to mexico.

315
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:09,398
Some things are more important

316
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:11,171
Than what two people want, Roland.

317
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,697
I honestly hope that someday that makes sense to you.

318
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,303
Look, Sara...

319
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:22,931
I'm sorry.

320
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:28,991
For vegas.

321
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:34,781
I'm sorry for vegas.

322
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:46,120
Hello?

323
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,023
Listen, I have a message for you from Gretchen.

324
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,947
She wants to meet with you tonight at 7:00 p.M.

325
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:51,459
At the Safari motel

326
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:53,703
On 109. Why?

327
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:55,636
She says she wants to clear the air,

328
00:18:55,646 --> 00:18:56,928
Whatever that means.

329
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:06,144
Sara?

330
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,129
I'm not interested.

331
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:12,755
Okay.

332
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:15,240
I got a bad feeling about this.

333
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:18,926
I'm the one on point. You're in the ambulance.

334
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:20,248
Why are you so worried?

335
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:22,171
I just got a feeling.

336
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:23,934
If anything should happen,

337
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:25,707
Call my mom in chicago.

338
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,143
Tell her I didn't die like a damn convict

339
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:30,816
Locked up in some penitentiary.

340
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:32,389
Nothing's gonna happen.

341
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,484
You ready for this?

342
00:19:47,494 --> 00:19:49,978
Yeah. Me and Sucre got this.

343
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:51,341
I know you do.

344
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:54,186
Good luck.

345
00:19:58,563 --> 00:19:59,795
All right.

346
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:19,018
1 million--for the brothers. Today.

347
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:24,016
Done.

348
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:45,873
I'm in position.

349
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,366
Got it, Alex.

350
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,558
The rest of us are standing by

351
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:49,850
At the intersection.

352
00:20:57,743 --> 00:20:58,745
No one's expecting you

353
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,919
To actually treat this bastard, right?

354
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,313
Yeah, I'm still a doctor.

355
00:21:05,717 --> 00:21:07,730
Sucre, how you guys doing?

356
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:15,103
Sucre?

357
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:17,858
Got to be kidding me.

358
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:19,330
Sucre, you copy?

359
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:21,634
We're good.

360
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:30,529
Being as I was the original recipient

361
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,224
Of the late mr. Whistler's artwork...

362
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:36,149
What's my cut?

363
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:41,277
$25 million.

364
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:45,915
Just so you know,

365
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:48,600
I have a very keen sense of ownership.

366
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,384
Six headstones

367
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:55,271
In Coosa county cemetery can attest to that fact.

368
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,695
The names on those grave markers

369
00:21:57,705 --> 00:22:01,952
Took a six pack of schlitz I had cooling in the river.

370
00:22:01,962 --> 00:22:04,687
That particular transgression put me back five bucks.

371
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:07,502
Imagine what I'd do for $25 million.

372
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:09,325
You'll get your cut.

373
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:10,727
But you're gonna earn it.

374
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,362
And how much of that payday

375
00:22:13,372 --> 00:22:15,445
Is Scofield and his crew earning?

376
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,709
Oh, I doubt they'll be around to collect.

377
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:20,865
There's a lot of blood being spilled

378
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,016
And a lot of money being

379
00:22:22,026 --> 00:22:24,691
Offered up for just a little old Black book.

380
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:27,456
What's so funny?

381
00:22:27,987 --> 00:22:29,469
That everyone thinks that Scylla

382
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:31,663
Is just the Company's little Black book.

383
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:41,069
How do I know I can trust you?

384
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:04,238
King Willow now.

385
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:33,949
Hey, buddy.

386
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:39,308
I understand from Lincoln your mom had a hamartoma

387
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,251
In her right frontal lobe.

388
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:47,381
That's right.

389
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:50,957
When a tumor like that gets large enough to be problematic,

390
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:52,630
It's gonna come with a lot of symptoms.

391
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,133
Loss of short-term memory,

392
00:23:54,273 --> 00:23:55,675
Problems with your depth perception,

393
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,208
Problems with your motor skills.

394
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,660
If you had anything like that,

395
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,844
You'd let me know. Yes, but I haven't.

396
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:02,367
And I won't.

397
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:04,130
And I'm fine.

398
00:24:17,553 --> 00:24:18,714
Michael.

399
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:26,257
The general is leaving.

400
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:28,060
All right, everybody get ready.

401
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:40,151
You doing all right?

402
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:43,136
Fine. Just not so good around blood is all.

403
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,338
I'll take care of the messy part,

404
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:45,981
You just help me get him on the gurney.

405
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,534
Doesn't take two people to crash a car, you know.

406
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:03,290
You're kidding me, right?

407
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,993
After all I've been through with you?

408
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:07,077
Now you're worried about my ass?

409
00:25:09,661 --> 00:25:10,993
Shut up and drive, okay?

410
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:12,275
Buckle up.

411
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:23,885
What is it?

412
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:26,169
Linc, we got him. He's two blocks away from you.

413
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:27,331
We're on it.

414
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:29,214
Here we go.

415
00:25:43,118 --> 00:25:43,959
What's he doing?

416
00:25:43,969 --> 00:25:44,811
Something's wrong.

417
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:46,053
He's turning around.

418
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:48,347
Linc, pull back! It's a trap.

419
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:49,519
Let's get out of here.

420
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,404
What the...?! Sucre, get down!

421
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:00,277
Come on, Linc!

422
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:02,461
Faster!

423
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:03,572
Keep your head down!

424
00:26:03,582 --> 00:26:04,764
Hang on!

425
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:06,878
You all right?!

426
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,651
Stay with me.

427
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:32,622
Stay with us, Fernando. You're going to be all right.

428
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:35,046
He came straight at us. We were set up.

429
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:36,568
So you're saying that they knew we were going to be there?

430
00:26:36,578 --> 00:26:38,872
Then they know about this place. That's exactly what I'm saying.

431
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:41,657
Brad, I'm gonna need some gauze. Somebody could be coming here right now.

432
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,490
If they knew about this place, we'd already be dead.

433
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,702
What about that Gretchen chick?

434
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:47,126
She's got a couple of pages from Whistler's bird book.

435
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:48,639
It doesn't make her psychic.

436
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,692
Brad, I need some gauze.

437
00:27:16,777 --> 00:27:19,992
Trust me now.

438
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:23,208
Well, it looks like someone set us up.

439
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:24,730
Seriously? Yeah.

440
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:27,114
And I'm wondering if it was you.

441
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:31,351
Okay, first you give me the leper treatment,

442
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:32,093
And now I'm a traitor

443
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:33,956
Is that right? Come on, Roland, who else

444
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:34,877
Could've known we were going

445
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,821
At that intersection? You know what, just because

446
00:27:36,831 --> 00:27:38,644
I didn't do Time with you guys, it doesn't make me a rat.

447
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:40,697
All right? I put just as much into this job

448
00:27:40,707 --> 00:27:41,649
As anybody else.

449
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,871
Okay, I make one little mistake

450
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:44,013
And all of a sudden I'm judas?

451
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:45,125
No, you know what? You know, no.

452
00:27:45,135 --> 00:27:47,960
Call Self, okay, because... Because I'm gonna go back

453
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,522
To the can. I'm Done with this... All right.

454
00:27:49,532 --> 00:27:51,996
Just calm down. Calm down.

455
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:53,569
I want you to look up

456
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:54,981
All the local businesses at the corner

457
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:56,264
Of king and willow.

458
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,547
I need the ones with exterior security cameras,

459
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:00,651
'cause I'm looking for a license plate number,

460
00:28:00,701 --> 00:28:01,773
All right?

461
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:07,132
How about an apology?

462
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,268
Where the hell is Scofield?

463
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,261
We've been waiting for him to break ground all Day.

464
00:28:18,852 --> 00:28:20,144
He's taking care of one last thing.

465
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:21,336
He'll be here in the morning.

466
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:23,310
And Sara, what'd she say about our meeting?

467
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,602
She's not interested.

468
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:27,186
Okay, well, if she changes her mind, I'll be there.

469
00:28:27,477 --> 00:28:28,598
Just so everyone knows,

470
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:30,802
This is Sara's last chance to settle up.

471
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,475
I want all the grievances out on the table

472
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:33,928
So we can move forward.

473
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:37,594
Listen to me, skank.

474
00:28:37,604 --> 00:28:38,656
You just got your stripes

475
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,619
Ripped off your sleeve by your old boss.

476
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:42,773
So whatever clout you had with the Company,

477
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:43,945
It's gone.

478
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,417
You work for me now.

479
00:28:45,427 --> 00:28:47,631
So you can try to pull rank on the hick here

480
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:48,592
All you want,

481
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,806
But Don't mistake my patience for weakness.

482
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,988
You're alive right now

483
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:54,553
Because I'm allowing you to be.

484
00:28:55,314 --> 00:28:56,486
So when I get Scylla,

485
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:57,968
You'll get your traveling money.

486
00:28:57,978 --> 00:28:59,311
And when this is over,

487
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:00,713
If you step one foot

488
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:02,616
On american soil, I'm gonna take

489
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:03,788
This gun...

490
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:07,414
And I'm gonna put a bullet

491
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:09,808
Right there.

492
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,877
And that goes for you, too, gummo.

493
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,530
Are we clear?

494
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,042
We're clear.

495
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,330
Here. I made this.

496
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:30,213
It's a chart of all

497
00:29:30,223 --> 00:29:31,676
The people coming in and out of the office,

498
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,350
Showing which Times of the Day are the busiest

499
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,083
And which are best for digging.

500
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:40,080
Just answer the phones.

501
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:46,911
I'll handle this.

502
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,601
Did you get it?

503
00:29:52,611 --> 00:29:53,793
Hold on.

504
00:29:53,803 --> 00:29:55,025
Hurry up.

505
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,491
Why are we doing

506
00:29:58,501 --> 00:29:59,463
This again?

507
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:01,526
It's an insurance policy.

508
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:04,571
If she tries to get out of that big Scylla payday.

509
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:06,575
How big of a payday?

510
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:09,890
One million dollars.

511
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:15,420
You put a gun on me again,

512
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,593
And these aren't the only set of prints I'll be copying.

513
00:30:17,874 --> 00:30:20,508
From this moment on, we are allies.

514
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:21,861
She watching?

515
00:30:22,161 --> 00:30:23,223
Yes.

516
00:30:23,754 --> 00:30:24,716
Brace yourself.

517
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:25,807
For what?

518
00:30:26,188 --> 00:30:27,350
Don't you ever

519
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,255
Come in my office again unless you're summoned!

520
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:39,771
Burrows was in the car.

521
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:42,646
It appears our source is dependable.

522
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:45,631
When I said bait the hook, I did not mean with me.

523
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:47,604
They came that close to killing me.

524
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:49,117
I wouldn't let that happen.

525
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:52,843
But if you're unhappy with my methods,

526
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,349
Maybe you should parcel out the job to someone else.

527
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,292
I Don't accept resignations.

528
00:30:58,443 --> 00:31:00,096
Close the deal with the mystery man

529
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:01,939
And bring the brothers to me today

530
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:04,263
Or your severence pay will be a body bag.

531
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:07,869
Broad Daylight, city street, and they knew your route.

532
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,271
If Scofield's mission

533
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,583
Was to kill you,

534
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,248
He'd have a better way to do it.

535
00:31:20,861 --> 00:31:24,357
Sara, you need anything? I'm good, Michael.

536
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:26,470
I'm good.

537
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:28,594
You are going be just fine.

538
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:30,828
Almost Done, Fernando.

539
00:31:33,903 --> 00:31:35,135
Here you go.

540
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,072
I would've died on this table if it weren't for you, doc.

541
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:40,775
Mm-hmm. Just wait till you get my bill.

542
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,297
Hang in there, Sucre.

543
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:44,651
Even if the warehouse ain't on the Company's radar,

544
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:45,983
We sure as hell are.

545
00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:48,327
This job's over. You Don't know that.

546
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:50,561
I ain't going back to Fox River, I know that.

547
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:51,913
What do you think Self is gonna do

548
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:53,777
When he finds out the Company made us?

549
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,992
We're about to find out.

550
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:58,364
Yeah?

551
00:31:58,465 --> 00:31:59,807
Hey, where the hell is Roland?

552
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,650
His gps just went offline.

553
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,807
I'm here.

554
00:32:40,296 --> 00:32:41,568
Took the corolla.

555
00:32:44,022 --> 00:32:46,055
Take his laptop, too? Yeah.

556
00:32:46,706 --> 00:32:47,868
Alex.

557
00:32:57,505 --> 00:32:58,597
You doing okay?

558
00:32:58,607 --> 00:33:00,740
How much longer? Almost.

559
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:04,406
Hey, you got this covered?

560
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,089
What are you still doing here?

561
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,872
Go get the son of a bitch.

562
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,352
All Done.

563
00:34:15,277 --> 00:34:16,659
You got my money?

564
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,197
Oh, yo, I thought this

565
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:22,910
Was going to be a legit business transaction, okay?

566
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,951
You Don't got my money, I Don't got

567
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,916
The location of the brothers. Where are they?

568
00:34:27,738 --> 00:34:29,371
Oh, god!

569
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:32,436
What are you doing?! What are you doing?!

570
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:16,911
Sara...

571
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:27,179
Hi, Sara.

572
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:38,007
A former mentor of mine once told me a story

573
00:35:38,017 --> 00:35:40,191
That I think applies to this situation.

574
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:42,495
At the end of the civil war, grant's union army

575
00:35:42,505 --> 00:35:45,440
Had lee's confederate soldiers outflanked at appomattox.

576
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,435
Lee understood the futility of more bloodshed,

577
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:50,458
So he requested a cease-fire.

578
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,582
He wanted to bring an end to the fighting.

579
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:55,076
Soldiers that had been killing each other that morning,

580
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,949
Walked across the lines that afternoon

581
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,432
For the first Time as allies

582
00:35:58,442 --> 00:36:00,766
To trade northern coffee for southern tobacco.

583
00:36:01,307 --> 00:36:03,510
Now, I Don't expect us to exchange gifts,

584
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,175
But that doesn't mean we can't be allies.

585
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:17,013
Of course, you can't have a cease-fire

586
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:17,965
Without both parties

587
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,317
Getting what they want.

588
00:36:34,102 --> 00:36:35,535
You have five minutes.

589
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:38,420
Put as many scars on my back as possible.

590
00:37:03,332 --> 00:37:06,046
I Don't want to rush you, but you have four minutes left.

591
00:37:06,587 --> 00:37:07,960
What was her name?

592
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,633
This is a one-time deal, Sara.

593
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,716
You want your pound of flesh, you take it now.

594
00:37:11,726 --> 00:37:13,890
What was her name? Who?

595
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,751
The guard--

596
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:16,404
The one you shot and left to die in my arms.

597
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:17,816
That's what this is about?

598
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:19,970
A guard that couldn't do her job?

599
00:37:23,396 --> 00:37:25,139
What was her name?

600
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:31,930
What was her name?

601
00:37:33,553 --> 00:37:34,435
Taylor.

602
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:36,047
Her first name?

603
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,922
Michelle... I think.

604
00:37:39,694 --> 00:37:41,757
You should know that this isn't about me.

605
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,881
I can handle the scars you put on my back,

606
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:45,323
But what you did to Michelle...

607
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,136
I had orders. She tried to help you escape.

608
00:37:47,146 --> 00:37:49,180
She did help me escape. She didn't try.

609
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,853
Sara...

610
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,060
You were too busy making an example out of her

611
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,613
To find the key that she left with me.

612
00:38:08,623 --> 00:38:10,245
Then she got what she deserved.

613
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:17,788
She saved my life.

614
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:22,366
And you took hers.

615
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:24,970
You proved your point.

616
00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:27,705
We're even.

617
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:31,291
We're a long way from even.

618
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:34,577
And when this is over, you'll pay for Michelle.

619
00:38:41,148 --> 00:38:42,550
Where are they?

620
00:38:47,188 --> 00:38:49,732
The thing about a gunshot to the kneecap--

621
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:53,108
It takes Days to die from it.

622
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,744
Now, if I were to shoot you, let's say,

623
00:38:56,804 --> 00:38:57,986
Here...

624
00:38:57,996 --> 00:38:59,980
The hollow point would tumble through you

625
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,164
Leaving White-hot slivers in your insides,

626
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:05,720
Causing unimaginable pain.

627
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,815
Only ending when you bled out on this pavement.

628
00:39:09,626 --> 00:39:11,279
You Don't want that, do you?

629
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:17,730
Then tell me where the brothers are.

630
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:20,765
They're in a warehouse.

631
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:23,710
Pier 31, San Pedro-- they're all there.

632
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:27,366
Please... Thank you.

633
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:30,131
No!

634
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:31,283
What are you doing?!

635
00:39:31,293 --> 00:39:33,226
I told you what you wanted...!

636
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,743
No no no!

637
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,649
All right, all right!

638
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:04,589
Enough.

639
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,663
You'll get your shot. Now back off.

640
00:40:06,673 --> 00:40:08,095
Alex, listen to him.

641
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:10,620
Hey, hey, you'll get your shot, man.

642
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,052
You'll get your shot.

643
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:14,636
Michael, come on. He sold us out.

644
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:15,839
What are you doing?

645
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,201
We got to go.

646
00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:45,569
Wait... Wait...

647
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:48,193
Wait...

648
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:49,766
Michael, let's go.

649
00:41:02,488 --> 00:41:05,312
Don't hand me any more updates.

650
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,732
They're surveilling me.

651
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:13,446
They're coming after me.

652
00:41:14,248 --> 00:41:15,750
General, we'll get them.

653
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,323
This isn't the first Time someone's

654
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:18,725
Made an attempt on your life.

655
00:41:18,735 --> 00:41:21,129
This is not an attempt on my life.

656
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:23,934
This is an attempt on my card.

657
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:28,983
Get Wyatt.

658
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,415
We're trying to contact him.

659
00:41:30,425 --> 00:41:32,178
Don't try anything-- just get Wyatt.

660
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:34,061
How do you want to proceed?

661
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,514
I want it moved.

662
00:41:35,554 --> 00:41:37,737
To make the necessary arrangements for security

663
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:38,739
Would take Days.

664
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:40,562
I Don't care about logistics.

665
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:42,636
I want it moved.

666
00:41:42,806 --> 00:41:44,639
Move Scylla.

667
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,582
