1
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:03,898
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:07,200
- What do you want with Scylla?
- Same thing. Bring down the Company.

3
00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:08,468
We need the pages.

4
00:00:08,644 --> 00:00:11,442
- Are we partners?
- Partners.

5
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:13,581
Your brother told me
about your nosebleeds.

6
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:16,309
- I'm fine.
- You don't look fine.

7
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:19,316
- I'm sorry.
- Consider this a warning.

8
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:24,022
Linc, pull back. It's a trap.

9
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:28,125
You all right?

10
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:30,094
Damn, you're hit.

11
00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:36,396
All right. You'll get your shot.
Now back off.

12
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:39,234
This is an attempt on my card.

13
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:44,675
- How do you wanna proceed?
- I want it moved. Move Scylla. Now!

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,217
Now, tell the general you killed us.

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,052
Otherwise, my hand,
it ain't gonna get tired.

16
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:01,761
I just hope your mouth gets tired.

17
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:06,162
That's funny.

18
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:12,967
Come on, Linc. Come on.
Enough already. Come on, Linc.

19
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,947
Believe me now?
Beating him isn't gonna work, Lincoln.

20
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:23,607
You tried your way.

21
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:26,151
We want General Krantz
to think Wyatt took us out.

22
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:29,015
Even if you do break him
and he does call the General...

23
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:32,627
...you don't think a military veteran
is gonna hear the fear in his voice?

24
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:34,826
They're gonna know he was coerced.

25
00:01:35,998 --> 00:01:39,092
Yeah, well,
I need some more time with him.

26
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:42,066
I hear you, but he can't make the call
if he's unconscious.

27
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:45,138
However we do it, we better get
what we need from Wyatt soon...

28
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:49,141
...because Mahone ain't gonna wait.

29
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:55,642
I'm trying to find the son of a bitch
who killed my kid.

30
00:01:59,054 --> 00:02:00,988
Lisa, what are we looking at?

31
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:03,681
Estimate is three days
to complete the move of Scylla.

32
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,019
Unacceptable.

33
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:10,195
Respectfully, this is not as simple
as unplugging a laptop...

34
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:13,596
...and moving it to another room.
The data on Scylla is too delicate...

35
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:17,136
I don't want excuses.
All I care is that it's done right...

36
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:18,603
...and done right now.

37
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:21,538
I understand the urgency,
but it will take three days.

38
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,544
I think it's a mistake to move Scylla
to the Raven Rock bunker...

39
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:28,547
...when the L.A. Facility
is one of the most secure we have.

40
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:32,217
The most secure location we have
is the one they don't know about.

41
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,147
Sir? Still no word from Wyatt.

42
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:37,690
He only uses the Company cell.
We can't track him.

43
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:41,056
We have no way of confirming
if he completed his operation.

44
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,665
Keep calling him. Draft a press release.
Photographs. Criminal records.

45
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,461
Everything we have on Scofield, Burrows,
all of them.

46
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:51,265
Tell our friends in the media I want them
to saturate the news and the papers.

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,807
I want it impossible for them to walk down
the streets of Los Angeles...

48
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,841
...without being spotted.

49
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:05,949
I assume we haven't made much progress
with our friend there.

50
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:08,715
- Any suggestions?
- How about we talk to him?

51
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:12,424
Great. You wanna give him some milk
or cookies while you're at it?

52
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:14,562
No. How about just
some nice conversation?

53
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,813
So they sent Florence Nightingale
to get me all ready to cooperate.

54
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:09,815
Actually, I'm here to help you,
despite what you've done.

55
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:13,614
- I'm still a doctor, and you're a prisoner.
- You're going to save me.

56
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:16,850
Don Self has a metal case,
and I don't know what's in it.

57
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:19,960
I imagine you don't wanna find out.
If you and I had a talk...

58
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:22,323
You'd make me see the light?

59
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:25,728
If you don't call the general,
you're as good as dead.

60
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:30,195
I've already been a lot of things
worse than dead...

61
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:31,464
...in my life, doctor.

62
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:36,139
You better have more than that
to threaten me with.

63
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:42,277
- Come on, Mike, she's okay.
- He's a professional killer.

64
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:44,815
Don't worry, he's locked up. Let's go.

65
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,452
Come on, let's go.

66
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:51,957
- So, what'd you do with Roland's body?
- Roland?

67
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:57,090
He's been reconfigured
and given a permanent resting place.

68
00:04:57,265 --> 00:05:00,928
Good. Take his bowling shirts and the rest
of his crap with you when you leave.

69
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:04,367
- Come on. The guy died.
- He died a punk. He ratted us out, Bellick.

70
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,632
You guys,
let's deal with the matter at hand.

71
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:12,539
Assuming these pages are correct,
and there's no way of knowing if they are...

72
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:18,384
...we follow this hallway through the boiler
room to here, where there's some walkway.

73
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:21,351
We follow that,
we'll have covered most of the distance...

74
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:23,991
...between GATE
and the Company's headquarters.

75
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:26,787
- What's this at the end of the walkway?
- I don't know.

76
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:30,693
Whistler marked it with an X. I'm thinking
it's some wall or serious impediment.

77
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:34,666
That's why we're going down prepared.
Tools, thermal lances, sledgehammers.

78
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,964
Okay, we get through that wall,
what's on the other side?

79
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:41,806
Again, I don't know. That's because
Gretchen has the rest of the pages.

80
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:45,469
But once we're through this, we can't
go further until she gives them back.

81
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:46,671
What's her game?

82
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:50,246
If she wants the Company to go down,
she should give you the pages.

83
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:53,854
Look, we're gonna deal with Gretchen
when the time is right, okay?

84
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:55,580
You go to GATE and get started.

85
00:05:55,757 --> 00:05:58,954
I'm gonna stay here with Wyatt
and make sure we get what we need.

86
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:06,059
No more dawdling, now. Move your ass.

87
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:10,002
High gear, gentlemen, high gear.
The boss will be here any minute.

88
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:18,972
I assume I don't have to mention
that discretion is paramount.

89
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:20,671
In other words...

90
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:23,109
...silence is golden.

91
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:26,846
You just make sure you stay in your office
and you keep other people out.

92
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,957
I'll stay in my nice air-conditioned office,
pretty.

93
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,525
And you can crawl down
into your little hole now.

94
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:34,821
Go on.

95
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:39,527
Go ahead, crawl.

96
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:51,044
- Cole, what the hell is going on here?
- Mr. White, are you back already?

97
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:53,737
- How are you?
- Fine. Until I found a resignation fax...

98
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:56,816
...waiting for me from Andrew Blauner.

99
00:06:58,286 --> 00:06:59,310
- A resignation?
- Yeah.

100
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:02,183
I can't get him on the phone.
I reached out to his fiancée.

101
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:05,451
She hasn't seen or heard from him.
She's worried sick.

102
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:08,828
He's probably on a bit of a bender,
sleeping it off somewhere.

103
00:07:08,997 --> 00:07:12,592
Blauner? He's a boy scout.
None of this makes any sense, Cole.

104
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:16,465
But I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna look into it.

105
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:22,008
Let me know
if I can be of any assistance.

106
00:07:22,177 --> 00:07:24,839
- Good morning, Mr. White.
- Assistance.

107
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:35,188
What is that sound?

108
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:47,567
<i>High pressure moving into the Southwest
should bring temperatures up 10 degrees.</i>

109
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:48,862
Yeah?

110
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:52,495
I hope you're having a lovely morning.
While you are nowhere to be found...

111
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:56,303
...there's sleuthing going on regarding
the whereabouts of Andrew Blauner.

112
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:57,735
And?

113
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,676
If I'm going down for this homicide,
I ain't going alone.

114
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,909
- We're going together.
- Relax, okay?

115
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:06,576
They'll never find the body
where I put it.

116
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:09,986
Now, where are Scofield and Burrows?

117
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:11,816
Doing their end of the bargain.

118
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,890
Which begs the question:
What the hell are you doing?

119
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:16,496
Me?

120
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:23,032
I'm getting ready for a meeting.

121
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:27,797
So your friends have been calling a lot.

122
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:29,773
They must be wondering where you are.

123
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,775
That's right.

124
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:33,378
They're wondering.

125
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:36,108
And the longer they do,
the more danger you're in.

126
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:38,684
Call the general,
and say what they want you to say.

127
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,753
And what? You'll let me go?

128
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:43,982
No. But Don Self will make sure
you spend the rest of your life...

129
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,253
...in a decent facility
without the death penalty.

130
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:52,155
Either way, if I make the call or not...

131
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,198
...l'm dead.

132
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:55,867
You know that.

133
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:58,437
And we both know that you...

134
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:02,474
...as a doctor, won't let that happen.

135
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:07,942
So please, let's you and I figure a way out
of this mess...

136
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,615
...that works for everybody.

137
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:36,802
- Whoa, sit your ass down.
- Out of my way.

138
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:40,436
I'm not...
I'll cuff your ass to that table, okay?

139
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:44,083
I know this is hard,
and I know what you wanna do.

140
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:47,710
But I'm trying to do something here
and you need to deal with that reality.

141
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:50,483
- Have you lost a kid?
- Yeah. I did too.

142
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,018
My wife was pregnant...

143
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:56,657
...and there were complications,
and the doctor messed up.

144
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:58,492
And she...

145
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,665
And they both...

146
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:04,767
They didn't make it, okay?
So I understand.

147
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:11,073
What would you do if you were me
and that man was right there?

148
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:15,182
- He's right there. What would you do?
- I don't know what I would do.

149
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,114
But, look, I'm giving you my word.
When the time is right...

150
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:20,015
...I won't stand in your way.

151
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:23,821
When the time is right, I won't let you.

152
00:10:23,992 --> 00:10:25,016
- Okay.
- Okay.

153
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:27,957
Did you see the way Mahone
was looking at Wyatt?

154
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:31,223
- The guy's hurting.
- He's more than just hurting. That's pain.

155
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,299
I never cared about anything like that.

156
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:35,333
I look what I've done with my life...

157
00:10:35,503 --> 00:10:37,835
...beating on cons at Fox River,
chasing money...

158
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:40,099
...trying to keep my own ass
out of prison...

159
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:42,175
This the pathway
you're talking about?

160
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:45,471
According to the map, this runs almost
the length of that courtyard.

161
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:48,616
It should put us directly beneath
the Company headquarters.

162
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:50,114
Listen.

163
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:51,547
There it is again.

164
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:55,320
- What's that noise, Scofield?
- I don't know.

165
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,425
Just so we're clear,
we go up that ladder towards the noise...

166
00:10:58,593 --> 00:11:00,117
...that we don't know what it is.

167
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:05,060
But if we're lucky, we get to basically
just walk smack into the Company?

168
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:06,325
Sounds about right.

169
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:09,060
You up for it?

170
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,728
Oh, yeah. After you.

171
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:19,208
I am no different
than that man over there...

172
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,211
...who wants to kill me.

173
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:26,146
Alexander Mahone was forced to do things
by the Company, and so was I.

174
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:32,089
But I know people, people in government,
people that can help you...

175
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:33,988
...and Michael.

176
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:36,323
I can give you a phone number.

177
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:38,727
Arrangements can be made.

178
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,668
All you have to do is trust me,
and this will all be over.

179
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:58,276
It is over.

180
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,590
Has White had anything new
to say about Blauner?

181
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:10,629
No. But he might.

182
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,734
Mr. Pfeiffer?

183
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:20,065
<i>- That would be moi.
- Detective Conor Mara.</i>

184
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:23,039
I was hoping I could talk to you
about Andrew Blauner.

185
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:25,371
- Of course.
- Great.

186
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:04,144
It's down this way.

187
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:32,936
This is it.

188
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:35,810
This is where the sound
was coming from.

189
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:40,250
It's one of the main conduit pipes
for the L.A. Water supply.

190
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:45,221
Thirty thousand gallons of water
rushing through this very spot...

191
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:47,686
...every second.
- Great.

192
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:50,660
Gotta be some other way to get around it.
Some other pathway.

193
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:54,199
Nope. This is the only pathway down,
and it leads right here.

194
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:55,393
How about over it?

195
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,061
We can't risk tunneling too close
to the surface.

196
00:13:58,439 --> 00:13:59,633
What do we do?

197
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,205
We dig.

198
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:08,148
Truth be told, Mr. Blauner
isn't officially a missing person...

199
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:12,753
...but his fiancée has a cousin
at the mayor's office, so here we are.

200
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:14,547
Here we are.

201
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:18,123
That's not to say, though, that there
aren't some things that concern me.

202
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,224
Really? Such as?

203
00:14:20,395 --> 00:14:24,991
Well, the fax that came into White's office
came from a copy shop...

204
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,361
...but Blauner had a fax machine
at his house.

205
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:29,427
Okay.

206
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:33,199
About a half-hour after he resigned,
his car was seen leaving the GATE garage.

207
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:35,035
The driver couldn't be identified...

208
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,975
...but it appeared as though a woman's
hands were gripping the steering wheel.

209
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:42,310
Let me stop you right there.
It always seemed to me...

210
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:46,613
...that Mr. Blauner was...
How can I put this delicately?

211
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,854
A swordsman. You know what I mean?

212
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,382
Actually, I don't.

213
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,956
He might be dipping his snout
into a different trough...

214
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:58,030
...and the fiancée is none the wiser.

215
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,091
From what I've heard about him
from his coworkers...

216
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,828
...that doesn't sound too likely.

217
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:06,735
If you don't mind me asking,
what is that banging noise?

218
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:08,637
That's...

219
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:12,943
It's trouble with the pipes. You know,
they loosened up in this moderate quake...

220
00:15:13,114 --> 00:15:15,776
...and now they shake
more than the trembler itself.

221
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,249
Some people here have told me
that you and Blauner didn't get along.

222
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,082
Would you mind talking to me
a little bit about that?

223
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:26,018
A few years ago,
a partner did the same move...

224
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:29,721
...against an enemy combatant
we picked up at the New Mexico border.

225
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:33,128
This guy didn't wanna talk.
He didn't know anything.

226
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:36,634
It worked then. It should work now.

227
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:46,239
Is that ambulance you got us
still out back?

228
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:47,972
Yeah.

229
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:00,458
Hey, come on, pal.

230
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:03,324
I got almost a decade on you.
You don't see me sucking air.

231
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:05,557
- I got shot, Brad.
- Oh, yeah.

232
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:09,760
- Guys, we ain't making any progress here.
- Nothing beneath this cement but granite.

233
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:12,303
We couldn't get through it
with a jackhammer.

234
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,441
Maybe we should go back,
find another way.

235
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,941
There is no other way. This is it.

236
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:19,671
This is where the plans lead.
This is our way to Scylla.

237
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:23,305
What? We got millions of gallons
of water in this drainpipe.

238
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,679
We can't go under it,
and we can't go over it.

239
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:26,945
I know.

240
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:29,153
But maybe we can go through it.

241
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,238
It's loose.

242
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:55,005
All right, Linc. This ought to do it.

243
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:58,710
- After I'm done, how much time we got?
- Not a lot.

244
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,078
Be careful.

245
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:01,547
You too.

246
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:13,624
When I was a little boy,
I had an old tomcat named Rufus.

247
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:16,299
He was a good mouser.

248
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,871
Tough as nails. Solid feline all around.

249
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,032
One day, I bring home this little kitty...

250
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,576
...from a giveaway box
outside the Pick 'n Save.

251
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:27,345
Old Rufus didn't like that one bit.

252
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:30,313
He arched his back,
hissed like a rattlesnake...

253
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:35,080
...and sprang out his claws
like a switchblade. You know:

254
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,420
That new little kitty
didn't do nothing wrong but be new.

255
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:42,028
Now, that's all I did.

256
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:43,458
I was being new...

257
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:46,862
...and Blauner was being this old tomcat,
spraying his territory.

258
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:48,695
Now, I don't hold that against him.

259
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,770
If he didn't protect his turf,
I'd question his character.

260
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,806
But aside from a little jealousy
on his part...

261
00:17:54,976 --> 00:17:59,913
...our issues were as thin as tissues,
I assure you that.

262
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,709
Detective, I pulled Blauner's travel schedule,
as per your request.

263
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:05,283
Thank you.

264
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:08,680
What's this?

265
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:13,717
Sir, we need to step out for a few more
bracket joints for the shelving.

266
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:16,996
All right. Yeah.

267
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:21,157
<i>But I ain't paying you to stop for coffee
and donuts, so get back here, tout de suite.</i>

268
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,530
Hey, wait up, Manuel.

269
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:27,032
I hired some men, out of my own pocket,
of course...

270
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:31,406
...to add some built-in storage in my closet.
I hope you don't mind.

271
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:33,543
No.

272
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:37,784
Here's the monthly breakdown
of where he traveled.

273
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:46,618
- Are you gonna talk to me now?
- Me? No.

274
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,785
We're done talking.

275
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,027
But you're not.

276
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,997
<i>They are all dead. It's over.</i>

277
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:57,699
<i>This will all be over.</i>

278
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:00,797
And this will all be over.

279
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,538
<i>All over.</i>

280
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:07,406
<i>They are dead. They are all dead.
It's over.</i>

281
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:12,619
I'm gonna take this.

282
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,654
Self.

283
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:25,222
Can you take a walk?

284
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,299
Yeah.

285
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,500
Come on, Sara. We should go.

286
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,977
Let's go outside.

287
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:06,773
My son's autopsy report said
that he'd been shot twice.

288
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:09,033
Once in the stomach.

289
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:15,045
Why, man?

290
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:20,720
Why? Just to terrify my wife?

291
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:29,096
And then a full five minutes later...

292
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:31,424
...right in the...

293
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:38,265
You, too, will suffer.

294
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,036
Then when...

295
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:45,178
And then when you can't stand the pain
anymore...

296
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,610
...you'll make a phone call for me.

297
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,515
You know,
Scofield said that torture wouldn't work...

298
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:56,486
...because the general would here the fear
in your voice. But the thing is...

299
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:03,762
...I want the person on the other end
of my call to hear the fear in your voice.

300
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,131
Press release, sir.

301
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:13,740
It sets forth that members of the
Fox River Eight and their accomplices...

302
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:16,399
...are alive and well in Los Angeles.

303
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:24,849
Where have you been?

304
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:27,484
<i>They are all dead.</i>

305
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:30,521
<i>- It's over.
- Good work.</i>

306
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:33,316
Your payment will be left
where we arranged.

307
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:43,470
This is no longer necessary.

308
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:49,937
Go ahead.

309
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,814
The access code to the covert entrance
is still both your daughters' birthdays.

310
00:21:57,885 --> 00:21:59,443
Everyone, leave us alone.

311
00:22:01,222 --> 00:22:03,087
I said...

312
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:06,854
...everyone, leave us alone.

313
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:08,889
It's okay.

314
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:12,998
She won't hurt me.

315
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,004
Lisa.

316
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:40,856
I knew you'd come home.

317
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:53,770
So how you holding up, you know,
not being with L.J. And all?

318
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:57,069
Good. He's a smart kid.
He'll look after himself.

319
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:59,804
I can see it, how much you love him.

320
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,210
My dad died when I was a little kid.

321
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:03,941
But he was a good father.

322
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:07,846
Let's just focus and get this thing done,
all right?

323
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:16,184
Michael said the manual override's
somewhere near the main conduit.

324
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:18,854
This look like the main conduit to you?

325
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,057
One way to find out.

326
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:34,714
- That look like it to you?
- Looks like it.

327
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:35,940
Fire it up.

328
00:23:48,062 --> 00:23:49,757
Come on, let's get out of here.

329
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:54,094
- Hurry up, bro.
- Almost done, buddy.

330
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:55,927
All right, ease it back.

331
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:12,908
It worked.

332
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:15,946
How long we got?

333
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,653
I don't know.

334
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,557
Water cut off to thousands of people.

335
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,030
The city will probably have that taken care
of in an hour, which means we've got...

336
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:30,602
...60 minutes to do 90 minutes'
worth of work...

337
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:32,805
...or we don't get to Scylla.

338
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:45,645
<i>What's wrong, papi?</i>

339
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,782
Hey.

340
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:57,992
Michael. Michael. Michael!

341
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,857
<i>What's wrong, papi?
Papi, talk to me.</i>

342
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:03,963
What's wrong? Talk to me. Michael.

343
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:07,340
<i>Papi, what's wrong?</i>

344
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:09,575
Michael.

345
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:19,048
You want some water?

346
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:20,880
I'm okay.

347
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:25,253
You're a lot of things right now, my friend,
but okay ain't one of them.

348
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:27,693
You know...

349
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:30,796
...I may not be the smartest guy...

350
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:33,658
...but I hear things.

351
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:37,967
Sara and your brother have been talking
about...

352
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,504
...you not feeling well or something.

353
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:43,709
Look, I'm just saying.

354
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:53,150
I need your help.

355
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:56,246
So, please, just...

356
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,221
...cover for me.

357
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:01,658
You got it, bro.

358
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:17,434
Truth is, Gretchen, I know you
better than you know yourself.

359
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:21,208
So you keep telling me.

360
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:24,716
When I first met you,
you were a 20-year-old girl...

361
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:27,445
...who had been dumped
by the Wheeling Police Academy...

362
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,987
...for failing her psych evaluation.

363
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:33,488
And where those
good old West Virginia boys...

364
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,527
...could only see
an emotional disconnect...

365
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:41,464
...with traces of sociopathic tendencies,
I saw...

366
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:45,901
...a Machiavellian streak
that would make failure an impossibility.

367
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:49,907
I had to let Wyatt do what he did,
because I needed to know...

368
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:57,816
...what my little bulldog may have known
about Whistler and his plans for Scylla.

369
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:02,185
I told you that I knew nothing.

370
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,917
You should have believed me.

371
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:07,819
I knew you'd never take it personally...

372
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:10,420
...because you are...

373
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:15,392
...and have been,
ever since I took you under my wing...

374
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:19,130
...my girl.

375
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,049
My girl.

376
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:46,094
The most sensitive nerve endings
are right here.

377
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:49,099
That's why acupuncturists
avoid placing needles near them...

378
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:52,261
...because opening up the nerve endings
in the fingertip...

379
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:57,706
...even a little pinprick
can result in quite a painful hot flash.

380
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:02,810
So a 5-inch needle being driven up
the length of the finger...

381
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:09,184
...can make your insides
feel like they're on fire.

382
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,847
Another fact of physiology:

383
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:14,926
The human body, when in extreme duress,
begins to shut down.

384
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:19,260
Brain activity decreases,
and your heart rate slows...

385
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,492
...till you just can't feel the pain
anymore.

386
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:24,569
And that's where the heart monitor
and the battery come in.

387
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:28,834
When your heart rate tips below 50,
that battery will give you a wake-up call...

388
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:32,570
...preventing your body from shutting down,
and then you will feel...

389
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:37,206
...every ounce of the pain.

390
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:41,718
And that's when you're gonna beg me
to make that phone call.

391
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:55,695
What can I do you for?

392
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:59,533
I just... I found some more inconsistencies
in your sales reports.

393
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:10,577
Listen up, here.

394
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:15,017
On that little computer of yours,
can you access into GATE's records?

395
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:20,216
If I access the network as an administrator,
I can see the files in non-PDF format.

396
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:22,453
I don't know what that means.
I assume "yes."

397
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:25,860
You let your fingers do the walking,
and you get me my sales records.

398
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,557
You are hurting my arm.

399
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:31,135
And don't make me hurt any more of you.
Now go.

400
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:53,116
That's good work.

401
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:08,534
Here.

402
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,282
I need you to measure this hole...

403
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:21,282
...and then make one of the same size
on the wall opposite.

404
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:23,450
How?

405
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:25,147
You got a belt?

406
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:57,348
We got less than 30 minutes
until this pipe is flooded with water again.

407
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:28,921
Acceptance is important, Wyatt.

408
00:31:29,256 --> 00:31:32,282
I had to accept that my son is gone.

409
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:34,856
And you have to accept that your life...

410
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:38,627
...your very, very short life span
ahead of you...

411
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:42,263
...is just gonna be filled
with agonizing pain.

412
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:46,503
At least until you do
what I've asked of you.

413
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:48,004
And then...

414
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:50,575
Then the pain will go away.

415
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,147
We're running out of time.

416
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,220
- Oh, man.
- What's wrong?

417
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:10,621
The stupid thing's empty.

418
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,523
All right.

419
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:16,564
I'm coming in.

420
00:32:30,684 --> 00:32:32,015
You can't do this, bro.

421
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:34,246
Just finish it.

422
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:44,488
<i>Hello?</i>

423
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:45,995
It's me.

424
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,823
What's going on?

425
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:50,728
Somebody needs to tell you something.

426
00:32:54,908 --> 00:32:56,705
You call her by her first name.

427
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,376
Pam.

428
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:13,753
I'm sorry.

429
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:19,997
It's over.

430
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,332
<i>And I love you.</i>

431
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:28,036
I love you.

432
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:53,295
- This thing is heavy.
- Hey.

433
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:56,094
Sure, show up when all the hard work
is done.

434
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:59,070
- All right, ease it back.
- We heard on the radio...

435
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:02,265
...that the DWP is gonna have the water
running in 10 minutes.

436
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:07,470
You all right?

437
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:11,950
This sleeve is too heavy
to slide it through the pipe.

438
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:14,785
Two of us are gonna have to go inside...

439
00:34:14,955 --> 00:34:18,914
...and guide it through that other hole.
- That pipe can flood at any time.

440
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:21,360
- I'll do it.
- I'll go too.

441
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:22,722
No.

442
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:25,328
- I'll do it.
- Oh, no offense, college boy...

443
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:29,434
...but this sucker's heavy.
You're gonna need a little bulk down there.

444
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,660
All right.

445
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:38,105
Use this to brace the sleeve
when you pull it through the other side.

446
00:34:40,614 --> 00:34:43,082
And just get the hell out of there,
all right?

447
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,317
How's Emmy?

448
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:56,155
I didn't come here to listen to you pretend
to care about her.

449
00:34:56,696 --> 00:34:58,220
Or me.

450
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,301
I came here to tell you
that I'm a free agent now.

451
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,167
The community we run with
know that I'm alive and available.

452
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:12,501
I can just as easily work for one of them
as I can for you.

453
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,977
So the question is, what's your offer?

454
00:35:15,248 --> 00:35:19,776
Actually, the question for you is,
why would you wanna go anywhere else?

455
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:24,715
It's not a time for grudges, Gretchen.
It's a time for coming together.

456
00:35:24,991 --> 00:35:29,121
The salad days are fast approaching.
Laos worked perfectly.

457
00:35:29,663 --> 00:35:32,496
Soon the populace will turn to us...

458
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:36,964
...the leaders of the military,
finance and energy, to right the ship.

459
00:35:37,537 --> 00:35:40,529
And then we'll rebuild this country...

460
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:41,833
...in our own image.

461
00:35:42,008 --> 00:35:45,273
And when we do,
I want you there beside me, Gretchen...

462
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:48,744
...as my number two,
like I always promised.

463
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,006
What about Lisa?

464
00:35:50,383 --> 00:35:52,851
I have already told you...

465
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:55,846
...you're my girl.

466
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:10,025
Come on.

467
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,334
Over there.

468
00:36:22,615 --> 00:36:24,276
Right up there.

469
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:39,931
You and I are the same, Alex.

470
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,158
I've done things...

471
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:05,514
- Push.
- Go. Keep going. Keep going.

472
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,022
That's good right there.

473
00:37:12,198 --> 00:37:13,961
- You got it?
- That's it.

474
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:15,897
I don't know how long it's gonna hold.

475
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:26,306
All we gotta do is pull this thing through,
and we got it. All right, guys, push.

476
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:32,443
It broke! The beam, it broke!

477
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,359
Mr. White.

478
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:50,066
I'm sorry to bother you,
but after my talk with Detective Mara...

479
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:54,138
...I was thinking about Mr. Blauner
and some of the conversations we had.

480
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:55,899
Salesmen are a lot like fishermen.

481
00:37:56,075 --> 00:37:58,873
They're always bragging
about their big catch.

482
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:03,612
Well, old Andy never talked about his sales,
no matter how much I pried.

483
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:07,275
So I took the liberty...

484
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:09,251
...of looking them up.

485
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,749
And there were, to say the least...

486
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:17,789
...irregularities.

487
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:21,194
<i>Good afternoon to you too, Andy.</i>

488
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:24,461
Two of your top buyers
don't have valid Social Security numbers.

489
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:26,866
I checked out the Social Security numbers...

490
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,532
...of the clients
he allegedly sold GATE workshops to.

491
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,737
In some cases,
the numbers are just pure fabrications.

492
00:38:34,914 --> 00:38:36,779
But the checks must have cleared.

493
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:41,180
He must've been money laundering
for God-only-knows-what criminal exploits.

494
00:38:41,354 --> 00:38:43,151
The point is...

495
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,350
...if the good officer gets his hands
on these papers...

496
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:49,962
...you know you're gonna be
up to your eyeballs in IRS auditors.

497
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,629
I suggest you go tell Mr. Mara...

498
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:58,669
...that you found some irregularities
in Blauner's expenses.

499
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:02,239
Writing off personal matters, et cetera.

500
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:07,502
This will explain why he disappeared
and will placate the po-po.

501
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,046
Okay.

502
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:20,982
Listen, detective,
we've discovered some discrepancies.

503
00:39:21,895 --> 00:39:24,762
- Pick it up. Pick it up.
- I can't. It's too heavy.

504
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:28,763
The brace must've snapped.
Let's try and get it up.

505
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:31,664
It's not moving.

506
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:36,501
The water's coming. The water's coming.
Come on.

507
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:41,879
- We gotta leave it there.
- But then we'll never get Scylla.

508
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:44,115
We don't have a choice.

509
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:48,615
- You don't. I do.
- What the hell are you doing?

510
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:54,687
What the hell are you doing?
Brad, don't do this. Brad. Brad!

511
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:00,494
Grab it. Grab it.

512
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:03,062
The water's coming.
Get your ass in here now.

513
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:06,532
Come on, come on.

514
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:09,865
You hear that?

515
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:15,608
They're flooding the pipe.
Linc, get out of there.

516
00:40:15,782 --> 00:40:18,580
- It's too loud. He can't hear you.
- Linc!

517
00:40:19,986 --> 00:40:22,819
Come on. There's enough room
for you to fit through the hole.

518
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:25,719
I let go of this, you could drop it.
It's too heavy.

519
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:31,329
Brad, drop the sleeve
and get out of there!

520
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,562
- Don't do this.
- You have a son.

521
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,771
- Don't do this. Don't do this.
- Push it.

522
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,876
Push it, Scofield.
Come on, push it through.

523
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:50,782
Push. Push it.

524
00:40:54,587 --> 00:40:57,613
Push it. Push it.

525
00:40:58,057 --> 00:41:00,423
Brad! Brad, don't!

526
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:03,628
Brad, no!

527
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:04,990
Brad!

528
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,689
Brad! Brad, no!

529
00:41:09,702 --> 00:41:11,033
Brad!

530
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:18,636
Brad!

531
00:41:52,078 --> 00:41:55,639
You can all come back in now.
Everything's fine.

532
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:57,373
It always was.

533
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,246
- You okay?
- Couldn't be better.

534
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,014
More important,
what's happening with Scylla?

535
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:06,852
- I'll tell you in private.
- You can tell me in front of Gretchen.

536
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:12,063
Not until I say something else.

537
00:42:12,398 --> 00:42:14,491
If you ever come near him
with a gun again...

538
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:15,759
You'll what?

539
00:42:17,737 --> 00:42:19,034
That will do.

540
00:42:22,642 --> 00:42:23,700
Scylla.

541
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,706
We got preliminary safeguards in place
faster than we expected.

542
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,872
We could move Scylla tomorrow,
if we wanted.

543
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:35,919
But now that Wyatt's eliminated
Scofield and Burrows, there's no need.

544
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:39,015
Scofield and Burrows are dead?

545
00:42:39,926 --> 00:42:41,257
Dead as Latin.

546
00:42:42,595 --> 00:42:43,721
Go ahead with the plan.

547
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:48,064
If a couple of boys from Illinois can get
that close, it's time to mix things up.

548
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:53,103
I want Scylla out of Los Angeles
by the end of the day tomorrow.

549
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,810
He wouldn't climb up.

550
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:13,688
- He just wouldn't climb up.
- Where does that pipe lead to?

551
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,987
- Maybe we can follow it...
- No.

552
00:43:17,597 --> 00:43:19,497
No, he's gone.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
