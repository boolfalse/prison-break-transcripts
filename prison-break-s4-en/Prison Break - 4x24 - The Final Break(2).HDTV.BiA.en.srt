1
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:14,771
Well, if you're watching this,
I'm glad.

2
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,600
Because that means
you're safe.

3
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:27,090
How does he think
he's gonna do this, bro?

4
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:28,662
He's going
to jump out of a plane.

5
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:30,523
I know he's gonna jump.
The question is, can he land?

6
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:32,046
Not without getting caught.

7
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:33,632
And how is he going
to get out of the cell block,

8
00:00:33,669 --> 00:00:34,527
even if T-Bag--

9
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:37,843
It's a big "if".
Trusting T-Bag is... crazy.

10
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,974
Michael, we, uh...
We really have to re-think this.

11
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:44,466
I have.
And there's no other way.

12
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:46,747
Okay.

13
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:49,166
I'm going to drop down
into this outer area here.

14
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,752
And I'll cut the parachute off
before anyone can reach me.

15
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:53,170
They're going to be
right on your ass.

16
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:55,464
I can hide behind this building,
wait for a window.

17
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:57,008
Then I'll make my way
over here.

18
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:59,465
That's the chapel.
Well hopefully, uh...

19
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,095
Sara will be waiting.

20
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,013
Why the chapel?

21
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:03,269
During the riot in '88,

22
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:05,266
prison employees escaped through
the administration building.

23
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:07,835
They wound up here,
outside the fence.

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,037
The administration building,
is connected to the chapel.

25
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,065
Which means that
somewhere in that compound,

26
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:14,692
there is
a subterranean exit.

27
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:16,502
If we can get
through it,

28
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:18,779
you can meet us there.

29
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:20,369
How's Sara gonna get
to the chapel?

30
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:22,106
She'll have
to find a way.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,989
Look, we're doing this
at 7 PM tonight,

32
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,828
just like we've planned.

33
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:27,903
- Where have you been?
- What did I miss?

34
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,333
I need you to find a plane
and a pilot.

35
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,543
I need you two,
to take care of T-Bag.

36
00:01:32,668 --> 00:01:35,819
Find out exactly who has this money,
and where they're keeping it.

37
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:38,758
- And then we have to get it.
- By 7 PM tonight.

38
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,352
Or Sara's going
to die in there.

39
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:45,848
Is everybody onboard?

40
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:48,726
Okay.

41
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:54,315
Tell me, you've completed
your assignment.

42
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:57,095
Well, I got the cash.

43
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,153
But there'll may be some delay
in final delivery.

44
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,495
The woman we hired is having trouble
getting near Sara Tancredi.

45
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:04,992
Then hire somebody else.
Call it open season.

46
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:07,140
<i>Put a bounty on her head.
I don't care how you do it.</i>

47
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:08,830
<i>I want Sara Tancredi</i>

48
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,247
dead by the end
of the day.

49
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,044
<i>Open cell!
One hour!</i>

50
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:26,931
Yo, we about to play cards.
Do you want in?

51
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:30,184
I'm okay.
Thanks.

52
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:31,727
You should.

53
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:34,605
With Daddy gone,
you're gonna need your backup.

54
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,401
Hell, we all did.

55
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,299
I've got, uh...
a pre-natal thing.

56
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:44,045
It's cool.

57
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,123
Thanks.

58
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,493
Not too smart though, for a girl
with a bounty on her head.

59
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:51,664
Aren't you heard?

60
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,918
Tancredi,
you have a visitor.

61
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:00,631
Say hello to your husband
for me.

62
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,061
What's wrong?

63
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,420
Look, um...

64
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,359
I know you don't have
any control

65
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,919
over what's happened here,
but uh...

66
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:25,281
Things aren't working out.

67
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,701
Okay.

68
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,406
I'm trying
to find a way to...

69
00:03:31,426 --> 00:03:34,040
To do... this.

70
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,433
But from where
we're standing right now,

71
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:38,419
there's only
one option.

72
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:42,265
Do you need more time...
to think?

73
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,383
<i>No. No, it's not
about that.</i>

74
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,195
<i>I've made up
my mind.</i>

75
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,263
'Cause there's nothing
you could do about it.</i>

76
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,747
Except...
pray for us tonight.

77
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:55,895
Pray for us?

78
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:58,356
You can pray for us
to be together.

79
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:00,941
Maybe
I'll do the same.

80
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,295
How can I rob someone
if I've no clue who he is?

81
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:12,370
The logbook outside says that
Krantz had one visitor yesterday.

82
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:13,746
A Joe Daniels.

83
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,606
Well if he was in
the power deduction, I'd say,

84
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:18,067
Daniels
is your bagman.

85
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:19,727
You know how many Daniels
live in Miami?

86
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:21,045
Thousands.
I need more.

87
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,600
Well you better
get crackin',

88
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:24,757
'cause if I ain't get
that money by 7 o'clock,

89
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,083
you ain't got your fire,
you ain't got your fire alarm.

90
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:29,261
And that means Pretty
ain't got his Mrs. Pretty.

91
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,182
Listen, my friend,
you're in no position

92
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,139
to makin' demands...

93
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,140
Okay, shh--

94
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,482
I ain't talking about
backing out the deal.

95
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:39,394
I put my ear on the ground
and come up with some details.

96
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:40,523
Good.

97
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:42,775
And now, fetch.

98
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:51,409
We got a pilot.

99
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:53,762
There's a guy
I'd busted 20 years ago,

100
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:55,092
running drugs
across the Gulf.

101
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,289
<i>Went legit.
Runs a charter business now.</i>

102
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,208
He must've jumped
out of a few planes, huh?

103
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,175
Yes, several.

104
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:01,604
Some for sport.

105
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:02,774
<i>Some necessity.</i>

106
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,046
It's a big difference,
Michael.

107
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,867
It's not easy hitting the X,
especially at night.

108
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,302
Don't worry.
I can go alone.

109
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:13,630
- What do you got?
- It's a test.

110
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:16,183
See, the prison was built
in the mid-80's,

111
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:18,537
so that exit in
the administration building

112
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:21,290
is probably protected
by an electronic code of lock,

113
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:23,347
modified by
a security card.

114
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:25,553
Those locks don't have
power protection,

115
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:27,361
which means
you can override them.

116
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:29,280
Then you can't just
go to the building,

117
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:30,448
shut it,
or blow it out?

118
00:05:30,448 --> 00:05:31,324
No.

119
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,202
1200 volt power surge will just
set off the other alarms.

120
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:37,455
Not to mention
that it'll kill you.

121
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,904
That's why we have
to find another way.

122
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:44,058
Yeah.

123
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,155
Yeah.

124
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,063
Talk to me, Mahone.
What have you got?

125
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,127
Nothing yet.

126
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,940
<i>I don't need updates
on the hour.</i>

127
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:07,109
I need evidence, intent.
It's not crap.

128
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:09,499
<i>Call me when he's in the
process of committing a crime.</i>

129
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:09,820
Yeah.

130
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:10,872
<i>I'm not going
to let him walk away</i>

131
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:12,114
from me
like he did from you.

132
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,241
<i>It's going down if I've got
to shoot him in the back.</i>

133
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:37,685
Sorry.

134
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:11,218
Time for you
to get paid now, bitch.

135
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,991
Are we friends now?

136
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:41,516
Get out of the way!
What happened here?!

137
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:42,328
I didn't see anything, sir.

138
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:43,955
- Move!
- <i>Me neither.</i>

139
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:56,342
Bad news.

140
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:00,237
Agatha Warren
is dead.

141
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:10,252
- Who did that?
- No one's talking.

142
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:14,833
But I hear it says fish.
Tancredi and Morgan.

143
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:16,779
No!

144
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,116
No!

145
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:22,361
There he is.

146
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:25,780
If you don't like this guy,
we can still find someone else.

147
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:27,874
Good to see you, Sni.

148
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:30,751
What you get into here,
Mahone?

149
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:33,564
Jumping at 1500 feet
ain't going to be easy.

150
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,131
You've gone back
on your word already?

151
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,030
Let's not forget who's doing
who a favor here.

152
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:37,645
Favor?

153
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,941
Favor that I bust
your old lady for traficking.

154
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:40,898
No, I did not.

155
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:45,777
If anyone asks,
I was flying tourists to the Keys,

156
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,941
and it's not my fault
they jumped.

157
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:49,022
Sounds good to me.

158
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,802
If you don't like this guy,
we'd take a day.

159
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:01,241
- We come up with a new plan.
- No, there's no time, Alex.

160
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:05,667
- It's not just Sara's life at risk.
- I understand that.

161
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:07,549
I know you do.

162
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:09,649
That's why I also know
I can ask for your help.

163
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:14,014
- Yeah. What do you need?
- If I don't make it...

164
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,535
I want you to make sure
Sara and my brother

165
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,629
get out of
the country alive.

166
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:19,643
I need to know
they're gonna be okay.

167
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:22,625
And I'm gonna trust
that you'll do everything

168
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,896
you can
to make that happen.

169
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:30,353
Take this.

170
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:38,486
I trust you, Alex.

171
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,864
Remember that.

172
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:13,693
Special delivery.

173
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:16,464
- What is it?
- I don't exactly know.

174
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:18,916
It came via messenger from uh...
the lady side.

175
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:23,614
"My man on the outside needs to know
who to call for the birthday present."

176
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:24,997
Whose birthday is it?

177
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,377
Well, just see to it that it gets back
to the same place.

178
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:36,238
Will do.

179
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,706
So this is
Joe Daniels' number, right?

180
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:46,905
<i>That's it.</i>

181
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,056
<i>Is that
enough information,</i>

182
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:49,717
or you need
a social security number too?

183
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:51,180
- That'll do.
<i>- Remember--</i>

184
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:54,177
I want that money wired
to the account number specified.

185
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:55,249
No wire, no fire.

186
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,584
You boys
do me wrong,

187
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,259
I have no qualms at all about
singing it loud and clear,

188
00:10:58,294 --> 00:10:58,834
you understand?

189
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,143
You know what?
Just be ready.

190
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:05,816
That was Sofia.

191
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:07,626
She'll meet you
in the San Andreas Harbor

192
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:08,679
in Dominican Republic
and then

193
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:10,598
- you guys can fly to Costa Rica.
- Cool.

194
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:12,134
I know
where Daniels is.

195
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:13,541
And after
we rob him,

196
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:15,486
I'll take the money
to Quik Green and, uh...

197
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:16,674
wire to the bank.

198
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,935
You're gonna meet us
at the airstrip, right?

199
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,904
Might give
a shot now.

200
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:20,983
Okay.
This is it.

201
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:23,652
<i>We're ready.</i>

202
00:11:26,905 --> 00:11:27,906
Thanks, buddy.

203
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:30,993
For everything.

204
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:33,045
Good luck, papi.

205
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:34,471
See you
on the other side.

206
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:41,396
Nobody's talking, huh?
Girl's dead. No one's said any?

207
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:51,800
I made it
in the woodshop.

208
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:53,695
Want to give
my daughter Emily

209
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,198
a birthday gift
on her actual birthday.

210
00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:58,339
So I need
to get out of here.

211
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,937
<i>It's funny.</i>

212
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:03,657
- You're never sentimental.
- Oh, I'm not. It's just for her.

213
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:12,321
We need to get
to the chapel.

214
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,038
We?

215
00:12:16,038 --> 00:12:17,398
There's no way out of here,
right now.

216
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:18,152
I'm gonna need you.

217
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,557
Yeah?

218
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:37,378
Mr. Daniels,
American Paint Company,

219
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:38,131
<i>here for the job.</i>

220
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:41,780
Well, this is Mr. Daniels,
but I didn't order any painters.

221
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,754
<i>It's Wednesday, sir.
I believe you did.</i>

222
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:49,332
Hold it right there.
I'm calling the police.

223
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:05,656
Get out!

224
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:12,650
<i>This is it.</i>

225
00:13:14,622 --> 00:13:16,599
I'll be right back.
Gotta get that parachute.

226
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:33,092
Michael!

227
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:36,327
Come here.

228
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:42,773
There's
a better way.

229
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:46,086
<i>Mess!</i>

230
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:47,379
Mess,
half hour.

231
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:53,382
<i>Little faster.
We don't have all day.</i>

232
00:13:55,512 --> 00:13:56,124
<i>Let's go!</i>

233
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:03,441
Got any ideas?

234
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:06,002
Yeah. Keep your head down
and follow me.

235
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:06,830
I'll think
of something.

236
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:13,906
You better think of something fast,
'cause we have company.

237
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:35,632
I hope you're ready
for a fight, princess.

238
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,047
This one's
to the death.

239
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:43,623
Do you think
you can overpower her?

240
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:51,444
Yeah. I don't think it's her
you have to worry about.

241
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:55,079
Just be ready.

242
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:06,078
- Hello?
- It's me.

243
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:08,852
I got the message
about the birthday present?

244
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:10,927
Was the gift earned?

245
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:12,471
What in the hell
are you talking about?

246
00:15:12,793 --> 00:15:15,212
- The birthday present.
- Birthday present?

247
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:16,773
Two guys showed up
at my house,

248
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:17,673
they took the money
and they

249
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:18,740
<i>beat the crap
out of me.</i>

250
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:30,936
Howdy, General.

251
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,799
I just thought of let you know
how I came in with some green.

252
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:41,229
My personal preference is
two Zegna bars and a copy of the Times.

253
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:44,087
So I see you
in the AEM?

254
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:48,357
You worthless son of a whore.
Go to hell!

255
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:50,208
Careful
I don't get there first.

256
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,828
Lest I become
king of that prison, too.

257
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:04,054
<i>Alright, from takeoff,
the prison's gonna come up</i>

258
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:04,782
real fast.

259
00:16:05,012 --> 00:16:07,247
So whatever you gotta do
to get ready, do it now.

260
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:08,185
You got it.

261
00:16:10,376 --> 00:16:11,251
We've got the money.

262
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:13,904
Sucre's just dropped me off
on the way to wire it.

263
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:15,939
Good.
That means T-Bag's set.

264
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:18,318
I'm goin' to see how long
it's gonna take and we get going.

265
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:22,974
You sure that thing's
gonna hold you up?

266
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:23,913
Yeah,
it'll be fine.

267
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:25,703
What about you?

268
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,815
This is not my first time
inside a prison.

269
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:31,975
But hopefully...
will be my last.

270
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:43,802
Think about all the amazing stories
you're gonna be able to tell your kid.

271
00:16:47,913 --> 00:16:50,192
You're gonna be the type of father
our dad never was.

272
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:52,340
Someone
to look up to.

273
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:55,892
Take care, Michael.

274
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:03,228
<i>Unless you've got details,
I'm hanging up.</i>

275
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:05,362
And you can forget about
getting your badge back.

276
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:07,658
He's got a plane.
He's got a parachute into the yard.

277
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:09,076
- What?
- Yeah, I swear to God,

278
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:09,878
he's gonna be over

279
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:11,328
<i>prison airspace
at 7 o'clock.</i>

280
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:20,821
Call in reinforcements.
I want 20 armed COs in the yard.

281
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:22,813
And be ready to turn off
all exterior lights.

282
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,895
Scofield won't see what's coming
until it's too late.

283
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:27,394
And bring me
Sara Tancredi.

284
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:35,352
Wait, wait.

285
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:37,374
What do you think happened
with Agatha,

286
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:38,313
it's not what happened.

287
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,033
I need to make this
right with you, okay?

288
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:41,734
Go ahead.

289
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:44,361
I was hoping
I'd see you here.

290
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:48,323
You know I still owe you
one big juicy favor.

291
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:50,074
Later, blue eyes.

292
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:51,794
I swear to God
she wanted to kill me

293
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,370
and I was just
defending myself.

294
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:56,081
- You remember that?
- <i>Yes, I do.</i>

295
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,541
My momma
gave me that.

296
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:01,767
Told me I was going to give it
to one of my kids one day.

297
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:06,300
Not only did I get knocked up,
but the girl in the family...

298
00:18:07,843 --> 00:18:11,217
And I practically raised Agatha
and she was no killer.

299
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,767
Now I can say
that much for myself.

300
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:18,687
You didn't know
what I had in mind yet.

301
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:22,107
Okay, listen, you're right.
Agatha isn't a killer.

302
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:25,652
She was just a-- real bitch
with a bit of more than she need to.

303
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,421
Skittles.

304
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:32,493
Okay.

305
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:33,983
We cool.
We cool.

306
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,914
We cool, we--
whoa, whoa, whoa.

307
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,699
<i>Kaorla. She wants you
to bring Tancredi to her office.</i>

308
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:44,088
A'ight? Okay.

309
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:10,631
Son of a bitch!

310
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,909
They'll be coming
right through here, okay?

311
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:18,604
Federal agent Todd Wheatley.
I need to get inside right now.

312
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:20,049
Emergency team
takes priority, sir.

313
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:21,762
I'm the leader of
the emergency team.

314
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:22,572
Now let me inside.

315
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:24,840
- Sorry. Strict orders.
- Go talk to your supervisor.

316
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:25,676
Come on!

317
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:28,781
<i>No weapons!
Let the suburban through.</i>

318
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:39,812
The plane should be overhead
any minute.

319
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:42,312
Hey, fellas!
Kill the lights.

320
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:54,657
As soon as he hits the ground,
I just want one of you to start firing.

321
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:00,914
Standby.

322
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:07,273
We're standing by.

323
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:11,000
Easy now.
Hold your fire.

324
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:15,012
Standby!

325
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:17,056
Now!

326
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,975
Let's go.
Move in, men!

327
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:44,096
Where the hell's
Scofield?

328
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,523
Emergency team
takes priority, sir.

329
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,391
I'm the leader of the emergency team.
Now let me inside right now.

330
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:01,684
<i>I've strict orders.
No one gets inside at this point, sir.</i>

331
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,561
<i>I don't care what your orders are.
Go talk to your supervisor.</i>

332
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,210
<i>Why isn't Tancredi
in front of me right now?</i>

333
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,455
We've just got
the situation under control.

334
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,463
We're looking for her
right now.

335
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:32,632
Oh my God!

336
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,763
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. It was Morgan.

337
00:21:36,886 --> 00:21:38,778
Check the kitchen.
They might be in the kitchen.

338
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,640
I'm not gonna make it
on my own.

339
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:21,402
Either leave me with tools here
or make up your damn mind.

340
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,115
Are you gonna be able
to make it?

341
00:22:42,197 --> 00:22:43,122
Yeah.

342
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:44,699
Okay.
It's now.

343
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:56,043
Alright, hold up.

344
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:07,810
Nah,
I think we're good.

345
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:31,960
<i>Don't move!</i>

346
00:23:40,677 --> 00:23:42,899
- Stand on the dark, now!
- Please, I just...

347
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:44,165
On the ground!

348
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,731
You're here alone?

349
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:57,691
Damn it, con. When I ask you
a question, you answer.

350
00:23:57,735 --> 00:23:59,488
Is there
anyone else here?

351
00:24:01,155 --> 00:24:02,198
Yes.

352
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:03,576
<i>Who?</i>

353
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:09,080
- God.
- Excuse me?

354
00:24:10,456 --> 00:24:11,507
He's always here.

355
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,253
I was worried about my little girl
on the outside.

356
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:17,874
<i>So I came to pray.</i>

357
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:20,746
See if someone would
watch over her.

358
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,265
Go check it out.

359
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:50,997
<i>The stove mess is open.
Need support right now!</i>

360
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,624
<i>I've got to get
these animals locked down!</i>

361
00:24:52,915 --> 00:24:53,916
We better head
over there.

362
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:01,841
<i>I hope that daughter
of yours</i>

363
00:25:01,841 --> 00:25:04,719
- is hell a lot smarter than you.
- So do I.

364
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:20,787
Hey.

365
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,521
Are you ready
to go?

366
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:34,463
<i>Nobody gets in or out
of this prison.</i>

367
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:36,465
I don't care if it's the President
having to take a piss,

368
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:37,824
you tell him
to turn the hell around.

369
00:25:38,134 --> 00:25:39,135
Get a team.

370
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:42,221
I want every inch of that fence line
checked for points of compromise.

371
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:43,347
Yes, sir.

372
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:49,515
Michael said this is where
they're gonna come out.

373
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:54,150
You think Sucre
made the drop on time?

374
00:25:55,526 --> 00:25:56,527
I don't know.

375
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:07,872
No, no, no.

376
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:15,344
<i>Please enter
your account number.</i>

377
00:26:17,423 --> 00:26:19,383
9248.

378
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:25,636
<i>Your account balance is
zero dollars and zero cents.</i>

379
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:28,957
<i>If you would like
to access another account--</i>

380
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:31,270
9248, pow!

381
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:37,318
<i>Your account balance is
zero dollars and zero cents.</i>

382
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:40,453
What the hell you thinking
you're doing, fish?

383
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:41,275
We're in lockdown.

384
00:26:41,655 --> 00:26:42,386
What for?

385
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:44,467
Something's going on in bitch block.
I don't know.

386
00:26:45,868 --> 00:26:47,498
What's it worth to you
to find out?

387
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:55,628
We're going to get
through here?

388
00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:57,919
On the other side is
a kind of an escape hatch

389
00:26:57,954 --> 00:26:58,881
for the administrators.

390
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:00,216
In case of a riot.

391
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:02,318
If this is the same system
they have in Fox River,

392
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,600
that door can only be open remotely
from the Central Control.

393
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,005
That's why we've gone
and ask for help.

394
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,600
T-Bag.

395
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:13,979
Tell them
what you told me.

396
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:17,770
Michael Scofield is about
to stage a prison break.

397
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:21,924
And I know <i>exactly</i>
how he's gonna do it.

398
00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:26,742
Exactly what did
Scofield asked you to do?

399
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:28,874
Just light a fire
in my cell.

400
00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:29,797
And the rest...

401
00:27:30,237 --> 00:27:31,669
The rest will just
take care of itself.

402
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,685
A fire alarm.

403
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:35,418
If that goes off,
what's your protocol?

404
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:37,273
State law, mandatory evac.

405
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:38,375
Hell,
he won't go break,

406
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:39,964
I was goin' to get you
to escort her out.

407
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:41,507
- Shut up!
- Get him outta here.

408
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,012
Alright, the evacuation's only
going to get him out in the yard.

409
00:27:46,303 --> 00:27:47,301
Whatever he's up to,

410
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:49,515
he needs noise
and he needs chaos.

411
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:52,643
Deactivate the smoke detection system,
the fire alarm,

412
00:27:52,685 --> 00:27:53,936
and while you're at it,
kill the horn.

413
00:27:54,311 --> 00:27:57,148
If anybody so much as bends
a blade of grass in this place,

414
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,733
I want him to be able
to hear it.

415
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:07,867
- What are we waiting for?
- We made a deal.

416
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:12,254
With the right price,
T-Bag will set off the fire alarms.

417
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:24,759
That's what
we're waiting for.

418
00:28:37,938 --> 00:28:39,106
- Michael, there's a--
- It's okay.

419
00:28:39,857 --> 00:28:41,642
See, there's only one thing
you can count on

420
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:42,946
when you're dealing
with T-Bag.

421
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:44,487
He's a rat.

422
00:28:48,324 --> 00:28:48,824
Anything?

423
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,826
So far, just a female inmate
loose in the yard.

424
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:53,037
- Tancredi?
- No, Morgan. First name, Gretchen.

425
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:54,664
- Over by the chapel.
- Alright.

426
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:04,882
Alright.

427
00:29:08,302 --> 00:29:09,428
Great.
Let's go.

428
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:18,615
Okay,
down there.

429
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,397
Okay.

430
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:39,726
Beyond this door should be
a hundred yards of tunnel.

431
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:41,502
On the other end
of that is Linc,

432
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:42,294
and after that,

433
00:29:43,004 --> 00:29:45,506
there's a boat mounted
for white sands and blue water.

434
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:51,010
A power surge to the system,
will override the reader,

435
00:29:51,675 --> 00:29:52,596
for just a few seconds.

436
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:54,348
Just long enough for you
to open that, so get ready.

437
00:29:57,935 --> 00:30:01,092
3, 2, 1.

438
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:05,860
One more time.

439
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,113
3, 2, 1.

440
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:18,435
I was afraid
this might happen.

441
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:20,775
It's okay.
It's alright.

442
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,324
We're going
to keep moving

443
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:22,460
and we're gonna find
another way out of here.

444
00:30:25,046 --> 00:30:26,213
I know
what I have to do.

445
00:30:42,396 --> 00:30:44,132
I need units to the chapel.
Now!

446
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:56,702
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

447
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:58,037
They should've been here
by now.

448
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,945
The battery wasn't generating
enough power.

449
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:07,188
We have to blow the system
for the whole building.

450
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,564
Okay.
What do you want to try?

451
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,014
This is
the main fuse.

452
00:31:17,098 --> 00:31:17,932
If I yanked that,

453
00:31:18,766 --> 00:31:20,267
everything will go dark
for a second.

454
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,017
I reconnect
these two cables...

455
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:26,816
If I reconnect
these two cables,

456
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:28,109
there'll be
a lot of noise,

457
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,695
every light bulb in this place
is going to blow.

458
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:32,571
As soon as that happens,
you need to open that hatch.

459
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:34,740
And I want you
to start running.

460
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:37,474
Okay.
What about you?

461
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:44,583
Michael?

462
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:47,044
Sara...

463
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:50,631
Someone has
to stay here,

464
00:31:51,507 --> 00:31:53,009
and someone has
to open the hatch.

465
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:55,604
And that someone's
gotta be you.

466
00:31:55,928 --> 00:31:58,117
Okay. So I'll leave it
open for you.

467
00:31:58,848 --> 00:31:59,849
You don't understand.

468
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,153
This is the only way.

469
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:10,401
I'm not leaving unless
you're coming with me.

470
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,447
But I am coming
with you.

471
00:32:21,954 --> 00:32:22,955
I love you.

472
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:25,624
God,
I love you too.

473
00:32:31,213 --> 00:32:31,827
Go!

474
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,550
Go, Sara.
Go.

475
00:33:38,572 --> 00:33:39,573
Downstairs.

476
00:33:58,467 --> 00:33:59,468
Where's Michael?

477
00:34:02,263 --> 00:34:04,964
Sara, where is he?
Where's Michael?

478
00:34:05,683 --> 00:34:06,684
Where is he?

479
00:34:21,115 --> 00:34:22,199
He's not coming back.

480
00:34:28,748 --> 00:34:29,749
He's not coming back.

481
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:31,785
What do you mean,
he's not coming back?

482
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:33,627
What do you mean
by that?

483
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:38,248
He's not coming back.

484
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,583
<i>He'll be here.</i>

485
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:49,894
He's gone,
Lincoln.

486
00:34:58,027 --> 00:34:59,165
Linc,
we gotta go.

487
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:03,282
We gotta go.

488
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:23,386
<i>We gotta go.</i>

489
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:57,827
<i>Hey,
I'll be over there in a minute.</i>

490
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:04,719
Why am I being punished?!
I'm the guy through the window!

491
00:36:04,844 --> 00:36:07,050
You aided and abetted an escape,
Mr. Bagwell.

492
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:08,854
And as far as
the authorities are concerned,

493
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:09,807
you're an accomplice.

494
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,810
Scofield!

495
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:16,101
Scofield!

496
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:22,778
Scofield!

497
00:36:45,384 --> 00:36:47,494
Michael asked me to give you this,
if he didn't make it out.

498
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,891
He said it would help you understand
why he did what he did.

499
00:36:55,644 --> 00:36:57,188
It's his bloodwork.

500
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:25,170
This is
the General's money.

501
00:37:26,385 --> 00:37:27,844
I was supposed
to wire it down

502
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,863
to Costa Rica for you
to pick up but uh...

503
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:32,641
I ran into
some trouble.

504
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:35,769
I'm sorry.

505
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:40,223
You take care
of that baby, okay?

506
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:42,609
You take care yours.

507
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:11,104
This is for you.

508
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:14,641
He never said
anything to me.

509
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:17,686
Why didn't he
just tell me?

510
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:21,144
'Cause he knew you'll try
to stop him.

511
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:23,608
He knew you'd do anything
to protect your family.

512
00:38:24,276 --> 00:38:25,277
But I didn't.

513
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:32,993
<i>Well...</i>

514
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:35,245
You will soon.

515
00:38:39,024 --> 00:38:40,125
Take it easy.

516
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:50,079
Sara.

517
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:53,764
Thank you.

518
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:57,392
Yeah.

519
00:39:36,723 --> 00:39:38,477
<i>Well, if you're watching this,
I'm glad.</i>

520
00:39:39,226 --> 00:39:40,435
<i>Because that means
you're safe.</i>

521
00:39:44,272 --> 00:39:45,482
<i>And that's
all I ever wanted.</i>

522
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:50,131
<i>I wish I could...
be there with you.</i>

523
00:39:51,613 --> 00:39:53,115
<i>But as you probably
know now,</i>

524
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:57,035
<i>I wouldn't have much
time anyway, so...</i>

525
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,455
<i>I made my choice,
and--</i>

526
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:03,166
<i>I don't regret it.</i>

527
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:09,043
<i>Anyway,
not too long from now,</i>

528
00:40:09,078 --> 00:40:10,966
<i>there's going to be another
little Scofield running around.</i>

529
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:13,010
<i>And Linc,</i>

530
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:15,178
<i>I want you
to promise me,</i>

531
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:16,626
<i>no matter what,</i>

532
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:19,516
<i>they're going to grow up knowing
their uncle is never far away.</i>

533
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:22,769
<i>And Sara,</i>

534
00:40:23,863 --> 00:40:24,954
<i>I want you
to promise me</i>

535
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,148
<i>that you're gonna keep
an eye on Linc.</i>

536
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:28,342
<i>As you may
have noticed,</i>

537
00:40:28,377 --> 00:40:29,624
<i>he has the tendency
to get in trouble.</i>

538
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:38,160
<i>You know we spend
so much of our lives,</i>

539
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:41,091
<i>not saying the things
we want to say.</i>

540
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,332
<i>The things
we should say.</i>

541
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,419
<i>We speak in code,
we send little messages.</i>

542
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,212
<i>Origami.</i>

543
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:53,300
<i>So now,
plainly, simply,</i>

544
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,845
<i>I want to say that
I love you both.</i>

545
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,391
<i>Very much.</i>

546
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:05,565
<i>And I want you
to promise me,</i>

547
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:08,482
<i>that you're gonna
tell my child,</i>

548
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:14,488
<i>that you're gonna tell my child
how much they're loved every day.</i>

549
00:41:15,697 --> 00:41:17,574
<i>and remind them
how lucky they are...</i>

550
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:19,868
<i>To be free.</i>

551
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:22,579
<i>Because we are.</i>

552
00:41:24,456 --> 00:41:25,749
<i>We're free now.</i>

553
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,335
<i>Finally.</i>

554
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:31,963
<i>We're free.</i>

555
00:41:34,806 --> 00:41:40,531
