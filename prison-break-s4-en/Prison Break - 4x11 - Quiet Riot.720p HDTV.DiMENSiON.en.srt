00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,780
Previously on Prison Break.....

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,490
- Company's moving scylla
- When?

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,390
Tomorrow.

4
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,030
- I messed up.
- What do you mean?

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,240
I mentioned Whistler.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,050
Hello?

7
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,000
So you're Feng.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,980
- Susan.
- That's right.

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,070
The wall itself is
fortified with steel fiber.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,280
The bad news is that there are
both weight and microphonic sensors

11
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,860
that will alert company security to the
presence of any breathing human being

12
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,300
that weighs more than two pounds.

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,100
Michael!

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,230
you have a hypo herrotoma.

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,270
And the doctor feels
that you need surgery.

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,420
- Two days.
- No. Tomorrow.

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,420
Otherwise you could die,
and there's no alternative.

18
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,050
Just a little bit more. Go slow.

19
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,560
No,there's no way he
deserves any of this.

20
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,780
Sing it,sister.

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,930
After what he put me through?

22
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,760
I can hardly believe it myself.

23
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,230
Look,what we must do is make sure that
cosmic justice rains down upon him,

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,550
for once we obtain the
good general's card,

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,320
there ain't hardly nothing standing in
between us and Mr. Feng's $125 million.

26
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,160
I was born on a mountainside.

27
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,470
Just keep both hands on the camera.

28
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,240
Let's go.

29
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,860
That's great. Okay.

30
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,130
Thank you so much,Dr. Malden.

31
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,500
Yeah,he can see you today at 3:00.

32
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,760
- No.
- We're going.

33
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,420
We need to finish what we started.

34
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,620
We can do this.

35
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,280
I need one more day.

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
Michael,Dr. Malden can see you today.

37
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,610
He's given us his word he
won't alert the authorities.

38
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,430
If you put this off and you,you collapse,
you're going to be treated by another doctor.

39
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,990
Do you want to roll the dice that
they're not going to call the cops?

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,990
There's still so much to do.

41
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,240
All right.

42
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,820
Three o'clock?

43
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:48,200
Last time I drilled a hole in the wall, it was
with an eggbeater back in Fox River with Michael.

44
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,650
I just can't believe it's all
coming to an end, and he's not here.

45
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,360
He'll be all right.

46
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,040
How do you know?

47
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,200
I don't.

48
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,320
I'm just trying to keep us focused.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,420
He's sick, but I guarantee you
one thing that'll make him worse--

50
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,620
going back to jail.

51
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,480
If we don't get in there...

52
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,620
that's where we're all going.

56
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,400
He's going to be okay.

57
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,570
I'm scared,too, but a hospital's
the best place for him right now.

58
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,350
He won't go without a
plan to complete the job.

59
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,220
Well,Alex and Fernando should be
back soon with the video,right?

60
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,990
Should be,yeah.

61
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,920
So,then,all we need is the sixth card.

62
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,030
Gretchen's working on that.

63
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,810
You really think we can trust her?

64
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,900
To get the card?

65
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,470
Absolutely.

66
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,810
Anything else? Nope.

67
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,290
Eight guards will accompany Scylla from
the basement bunker up to the garage,

68
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,900
where an armored truck will be waiting.

69
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,300
One truck is not going
to be enough security.

70
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,260
That is why I have a full Secret
Service escort to March Air Force Base.

71
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,410
There,it will be
brought aboard a C-130.

72
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,530
We need air support all
the way to River Rock.

73
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,510
Colonel Rifi is lending
us three of his F-18s.

74
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,510
It may be hard for you to believe,
but I do have this under control.

75
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,660
There's nothing for you to worry about.

76
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,740
When the plane lands,the same
precautions will be taken.

77
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,280
Armored truck to guards
to final location.

78
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,020
Our old room.1pm.

79
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,460
That's fine.

80
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,890
Are you going somewhere?

81
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,910
I have an appointment.

82
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,200
Today?

83
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,400
You told me there was
nothing to worry about.

84
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,780
Just tell me it's not Gretchen.

85
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,840
This is ridiculous.

86
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,400
It's a personal matter.
I'm not going to discuss it.

87
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,710
I don't trust her.

88
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,750
That's nothing new.

89
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,760
I'll be back in an hour.

90
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,040
What'd you find out?

91
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,860
You'll be awake the whole time.

92
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,780
The only anesthetic you're going to
need is four minor injections of local--

93
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,270
two in your forehead and
two in the back of your head.

94
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,460
And that's for the brace?

95
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,210
The frame, yeah,and...

96
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,440
attaching that is going to be
the most uncomfortable part.

97
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,760
They're going to have to
secure four pins into your skull

98
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,420
and they're going to need
a small drill to do it.

99
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,640
Do we have to listen to this?

100
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,460
I want to hear this,Linc.

101
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,810
And then what?

102
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,740
Uh,another CT scan.

103
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,260
The doctor will use the three-dimensional imagery
to pinpoint the exact location of the growth.

104
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,560
And once you have that?

105
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,530
Then it's the Gamma Knife unit.

106
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,850
They'll fit you with a helmet,

107
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,000
they'll calibrate it so that each of the
201 holes are aimed directly for the tumor,

108
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,870
and at that point...

109
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,040
I've got two more boxes in the car
that you guys got to bring in yourself.

110
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,490
All right. You okay?

111
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,930
- Because the last time I saw you...
- Yeah,I'm fine.

112
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,130
I was just a little dehydrated.

113
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,230
All right,good. This is
the stuff you requested.

114
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,780
You sure this is gonna get you in?

115
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,130
Let us worry about getting in. You
worry about how we're getting out.

116
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,230
I got someone keeping an
eye on Gretchen and Bagwell.

117
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,600
If they try anything,
they're getting taken out.

118
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,280
Nothing is going to get
between us and Scylla.

119
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,870
You sure you're all right?

120
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,240
Yeah,it's just,uh, you know,we're
breaking into Company headquarters,

121
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,440
and,uh,you'll understand why
we're all a little on edge.

122
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,180
Understood.

123
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,600
You know,I was thinking, when your
father approached me about doing this,

124
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,750
I felt like I was,uh, chasing
a ghost or something,but...

125
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,610
'cause of the work you guys
have done, today is the day

126
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,910
we're gonna take these bastards down.

127
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,130
- You get it?
- Got it.

128
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,890
- We got four hours.
- How come?

129
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,820
I'm going in for treatment.

130
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,790
Here we go. Scylla.

131
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,950
Obviously, we've got
a lot to figure out.

132
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,470
We have to break through two
walls-- one concrete,one glass--

133
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,300
and do it without making a sound.

134
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,200
Hypersensitive parabolic microphones,
pointed in all directions.

135
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,550
The floor sensors can detect an
added surface load of just two pounds.

136
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,210
So...

137
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,250
we have to traverse the distance between
the two walls without touching the floor

138
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,900
and do all that without generating
any kind of body heat whatsoever.

139
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,240
*****These are the latest
in heat-sensing technology.

140
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,620
We make one wrong move, the camera goes
on,and General Krantz will know we're inside.

141
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,400
It's amazing.

142
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,070
All this security and only one man
has access to video surveillance?

143
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,740
The Company doesn't want any record
of what's going on down there.

144
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,260
Can we access that elevator?

145
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,210
No,it's right in the middle of the Company
building-- there are ten layers of security.

146
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,460
We have to go where they're not expecting
us, starting with the concrete wall.

147
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,220
- Sucre,you were drilling there, right?
- Yes.

148
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,520
It's fortified with steel
fibers,just like you said.

149
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:21,770
All right, in order to get through that, we
have to generate an electromagnetic field...

150
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,330
We have to generate an
electromagnetic field...

151
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,310
To have,uh, an electromagnetic
field with the force that we want,

152
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,900
we're going to need at least a couple
of car batteries. Can you get that?

153
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,710
Yeah,yeah.

154
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,480
We can do this.

155
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,890
Uh,what time are we expecting
Gretchen to get that sixth card?

156
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,310
What took you so long?

157
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,060
You know how I get when I'm hungry.

158
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,520
It wasn't easy getting
away from the office.

159
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,710
I could have come to you...

160
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,970
like old times.

161
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,870
I almost wish there was
a mahogany desk in here.

162
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,290
you're tense.

163
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,300
Take off this jacket.
Let me get in there.

164
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,510
I didn't bring it with me.

165
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,540
My card. That is what
you're looking for,right?

166
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,730
What are you talking about?

167
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,890
- Your card.
- You forget.

168
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,340
I'm the one that taught you how to lie.

169
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:58,230
I never thought that, at the age of
63, I could still have my heart broken.

170
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,860
Why did you feel you
need to steal my card?

171
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,490
Don't you know that if you'd waited just a
little bit longer, you'd have had one of your own?

172
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,480
I'm sorry. I'm...

173
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,010
Who are you selling it to?

174
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,730
- That's-That's
not why... - Who?

175
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,080
I'm the mother of your child.

176
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,360
Please,for Emily's sake.

177
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:27,130
Please,Jonathan. Please. I love you.

178
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,990
If I ever see you again...

179
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,780
I'll shoot you on sight.

180
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,490
Is everything all right,Cole?

181
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,950
I got something important
you need to know.

182
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,650
We're gonna be rich.

183
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,300
So,here's the question.

184
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,600
How much is it gonna cost me
to get that jacket off of you?

185
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,560
Excuse me?

186
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,860
Last day I'm ever gonna see you.

187
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,660
You're all covered up.

188
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,200
I cannot abide.

189
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,610
- 100?
- You want to pay me to take my clothes off?

190
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,560
Not all of them. Just the jacket.

191
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,170
- 200
- I'm not gonna strip for you.

192
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,750
Pity on an old man.

193
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,820
You're disgusting.

194
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,270
And lecherous and vile.

195
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,450
And soon to be wealthy beyond belief.

196
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,040
One thousand dollars.

197
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,110
Why so modest all of a sudden?

198
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,890
Cole,I need to see you in my office now.

199
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,350
Thank you for calling
Gate. How can I help you?

200
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,470
It was Mr. White in his
office with the lead stapler.

201
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,900
Cole,yesterday, with that Idaho
group, you made this company $35,000.

202
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,920
And I would like to return the favor.

203
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,610
It's our annual cruise.

204
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,920
Seven days and six nights
of non-stop pitching.

205
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,130
I personally clear
$50,000 on most trips,

206
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,420
but for everything you've
done, it's all yours.

207
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,940
The least I could do.

208
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,440
It leaves today?

209
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,610
Go home and pack.
I'll see you in a week.

210
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,390
Unfortunately, I have some business
I need to take care of right here.

211
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,770
Okay,so,here's how it works.

212
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,690
As soon as the sensors pick up any kind
of a heat source 90 degrees or more,

213
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,710
system goes into standby,
a yellow light comes on.

214
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,440
After five seconds in standby, if the
heat source isn't gone, we have an alarm.

215
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,850
So we got six seconds to make it across
the hallway andthrough the glass wall?

216
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
Basically.

217
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,490
If we get our hands on some liquid
nitrogen, we could regulate the temperature.

218
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,340
Yeah.

219
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,490
Kill two birds with one stone.

220
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,480
See if you can get some of that.

221
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,340
I'm not going to ask how you're feeling.

222
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,160
Good.

223
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,980
About four years after I joined the
bureau, my first special agent in charge--

224
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,590
he was diagnosed with liver cancer.

225
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,580
But for him, the hardest
part wasn't the treatment.

226
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,440
The hardest part was leaving the
office, because we had this...

227
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,720
we had this big RICO case
that was about to go to trial,

228
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,560
and we're talking thousands of
man hours, five years of research.

229
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,260
And the guy was going to be in chemo.

230
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,830
And he was scared.

231
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,910
He was scared that we were gonna lose the
case, and that a lot of bad men were gonna walk.

232
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,880
Let me guess: He had a ragtag band of
criminals ready to pick up the slack.

233
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,210
It was something like that.

234
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,430
We're not going to let you down,Michael.

235
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,750
What happened to your boss?

236
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,920
Oh,he was there to see us win.

237
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,870
You're sure she's a Fed?

238
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,950
Wouldn't take off her jacket
for a thousand dollars.

239
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,530
She's got a gun under there.

240
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,890
It's a complication.

241
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,600
Well,that's a nice way to put it.

242
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,760
Sort of like you not
getting the sixth card.

243
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,480
What are we calling that now,a setback?

244
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,380
Relax.

245
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,450
You have any idea what
I'm giving up here?

246
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,050
I was guaranteed 50 grand.

247
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,380
You're crying over
$50,000? Are you serious?

248
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,420
I have a job. I make money. I
get mail. People call me sir.

249
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,980
12-hour days and
eating leftover lo-mein.

250
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,070
Something tells me Theodore Bagwell
wouldn't last long in this situation.

251
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:25,130
Yeah,maybe, but Cole Pfeiffer would.

252
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,420
You want to pout, you do it tomorrow.

253
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,330
We have work to do.

254
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,100
Is it really worth $125 million?

255
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,530
It's worth twice as much.

256
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,910
What if they refuse to hand it over?

257
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,360
Either we pay for
Scylla, or we kill for it.

258
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,110
Hello?

259
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,650
Feng,we need to talk.

260
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,280
Hey,give me a second
here,guys,just a second.

261
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,900
We can't make any noise
above ten decibels.

262
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,930
You got two of those?

263
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,230
Absolutely.

264
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,620
This is gonna work,right?

265
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,190
It should.

266
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,230
No,not just that.

267
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,860
The whole thing.

268
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,590
I mean, do we even have a chance?

269
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,860
Just make sure the hole
is in the right place.

270
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,110
So,where are we?

271
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,390
Gretchen didn't get us the sixth card.

272
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,570
- We need that sixth card,Don.
- I know.

273
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,810
If we don't get the sixth card,

274
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,530
- we're never gonna crack Scylla.
- I know it.

275
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,370
*****

276
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,150
Well,we know they're
moving Scylla today.

277
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,990
We know we can't just waltz into the
General's office and steal that last card,

278
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,950
so where does that leave us?

279
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,920
Then there's got to be a
way. There has to be a way.

280
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,610
Not without losing another man.

281
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,220
Believe me,I spent the last week trying
to figure out how to get that sixth card,

282
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,140
and every scenario ends with a gun to
someone's head, and that is not acceptable.

283
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,340
You know,Gretchen did pass on this
one piece of information for you.

284
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,950
This could be helpful.

285
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,150
Hello?

286
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,980
The buyer just showed up.

287
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,620
All right,well,find
out what they're up to.

288
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,620
Mr. Feng,so glad you
could come and see us.

289
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,830
I was expecting the next time the three
of us would be in the same room together,

290
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,590
that you'd have something for me.

291
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:52,610
That was our expectation,as well,
but we've hit a few bumps in the road.

292
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,920
Now,to ensure the item's safe
recovery, we need your help.

293
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,120
It's time to go.

294
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,290
"All that avails is flight."

295
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,380
Maybe my father was onto something.

296
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,730
If they all die because we tried to take
down the Company, and I survive because...

297
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,170
because I called in sick...

298
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,960
how am I gonna live with myself?

299
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:51,990
You're gonna get through this.

300
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,580
I'm not going to the hospital.

301
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,280
What?

302
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,230
Linc,just get in the car.

303
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,210
I'm going with you.

304
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,250
If I still had a medical
license, I'd lose it over this.

305
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,120
This is usually given to epileptics.

306
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,280
It will suppress the rapid firing
of neurons for the next three hours,

307
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,580
making it unlikely that you'll
have a seizure in that time,

308
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,220
but Michael,any added
mental or physical stress...

309
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,470
- I get it.
- I mean it.

310
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,530
I don't want you to move
unless you absolutely have to.

311
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,460
And as soon as this is over,
I'm taking you to the hospital.

312
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,710
You all right?

313
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,860
This is gonna go exactly as planned.

314
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,470
I promise.

315
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,390
I'm not praying for me.

316
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,530
Let's go.

317
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,970
You wanted to see me?

318
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,000
It's the second Tuesday of the month.

319
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,490
Don't you have your Eagles and Angels luncheon?

320
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,290
I figured I'd skip it today.

321
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,830
You called me in here to confirm my lunch plans?

322
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,400
You were right.

323
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,200
If it weren't for you,this would be in the wind.

324
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,050
Is she dead?

325
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,220
Let's just say she won't bother either of us anymore.

326
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,990
But I do want Scylla moved right now.

327
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,390
Our mechanics are on the tarmac inspecting the C-130.

328
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,240
When they sign off,we'll be ready to move.

329
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,420
Call the other card holders,get them in here.

330
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:14,120
Did,uh,Self call you,uh,regarding a little snafu with the General?

331
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,040
Get out of my way.

332
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,720
Just for,uh,clarification's sake,the sixth card is part of the to-do list,right,gentlemen?

333
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,090
The game's afoot.

334
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,370
Does Michael have a way to get the card?

335
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,000
I've worked with Michael Scofield before,both with him and against him.

336
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,080
There's no way he's going down there without a plan to finish the job.

337
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,730
I got a call from an old friend.

338
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,470
Heard Scylla was in play.He wants to know if he can get in on it.

339
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,490
A bidding war?

340
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,840
He's prepared to offer 200.

341
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,020
- Is he for real?- I don't know.

342
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,050
I've set up a safe house where we can hear him out.

343
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,380
- Do you have a pen?- Just a minute.

344
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,820
1917 Piermont.

345
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,580
One nine one seven Piermont--

346
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,120
got it.I'm on my way.

347
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,000
Uh,good afternoon.Thank you for calling Gate.

348
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,470
I got some last minute negotiations with the buyer to speak about.

349
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,080
- I'll be back lickety-split.- See you later.

350
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,930
Can you hold,please?

351
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,650
All right.

352
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,730
This is it.

353
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,490
Now,does anyone have any questions about what they're supposed to do?

354
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,870
That hole you drilled in the wall this morning--

355
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,720
once we get over there,if we make too much noise,

356
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,310
the sound waves will travel through the wall and get picked up by the sensors on the other side.

357
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,350
So,from this point on,we need absolute silence.

358
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,990
Alex,good luck.

359
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,030
You,too.

360
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,290
Ready?

361
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,460
All right.

362
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,870
We have to break through two walls-- one concrete,one glass--

363
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,130
and do it without making a sound.

364
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,730
In order to get through that,we have to generate an electromagnetic field.

365
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,730
To have an electromagnetic field with the force that we want,

366
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,070
we're gonna need at least a couple of car batteries.

367
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,940
starting with the concrete wall.

368
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,560
Sucre,you were drilling there,right?

369
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,080
It's fortified with steel fibers,just like you said.

370
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,600
You sure this is it?

371
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,780
1917 Piermont Avenue.

372
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,250
Okay.

373
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,600
When was the last time you swept a room?

374
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,890
The academy.

375
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,150
All right,just follow my lead,okay?

376
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,900
Because Gretchen and Bagwell have no respect for human life.

377
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,020
Okay?They go for a weapon,you shoot.

378
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,860
Okay.They try to run,you shoot.

379
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,530
If they do anything than kneel down and put their hands behind their heads...

380
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,150
- I shoot.- And don't miss.

381
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,240
Agent Self.

382
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,700
We've been waiting.

383
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,020
That's Feng.He's got them.

384
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,840
When Scofield and Burrows walk through the door,

385
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,790
give them an opportunityto surrender.

386
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,380
If we can avoid confrontation,that's the best case scenario.

387
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,950
There's no way they're gonna hand it over without a fight.

388
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,700
If they take that position,we'll respond in kind.

389
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,960
$125 million.

390
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,810
Only cherry that could top this sunny day.

391
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,780
You can keep your Burrows andyour Mahone and your Sucre.

392
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,830
Just leave Scofield for me.

393
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,450
We got a green lighton the C130.

394
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,130
It's time.

395
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,090
Thank you.

396
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,980
Oren,Tuxhorn and Edison are standing by.

397
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,880
Scuderi was in Las Vegas.

398
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,420
You think we could get the state of Nevada to outlaw gambling?

399
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,400
I somehow doubt that.

400
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,760
His plane will touch down within about an hour.

401
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,440
Then you can make your luncheon.

402
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,270
I would rather stay.

403
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,320
Now more than ever,we need the support of law enforcement.

404
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,420
- I will call you when we're ready to move.
- General,I...

405
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,740
There's nothing morefor you to worry about.

406
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,670
Lisa?

407
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,320
Very good work.

408
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,110
I need a team downstairs.Now.

409
