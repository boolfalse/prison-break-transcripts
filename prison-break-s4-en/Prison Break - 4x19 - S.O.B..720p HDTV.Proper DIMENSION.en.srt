1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,810
This is an overview. That's just the
beginning of what's on here.

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,300
You honor your side of the agreement, and I will
do the unveiling at the conference tomorrow.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,960
I thought we were working with these people.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,920
So did I.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,030
Damn well almost got our asses
handed to us getting these.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,100
These things are for tomorrow.
I want Scylla today!

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,240
Vincent Sandinsky.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,190
Let's go.

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,410
What are you going to do?

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,780
I warned you not to come, Michael.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,450
Well, it's not over, not by a long shot.

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,510
Christina Rose Scofield, that
name mean anything to you?

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,740
No.

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,830
Yes.

15
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,820
How badly do you want him, mom?

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,680
Michael, listen to me.

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,040
That's not an answer.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,390
I'll be in touch.

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,910
I get the ass-Kicking of a lifetime and
you come back empty-Handed?

20
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,700
- What?
- Linc and Michael's mother-

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,650
She's got Scylla here in Miami.

22
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,530
Fuel the jet.

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,170
We're going to Miami.

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,550
The guy knows something.

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,480
I don't know what else I
can do to help you guys.

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,460
Please let me go.

27
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,020
I won't say a word to anyone about this.

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,760
Never heard of the name Christina Scofield?

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,300
I told you, no.

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,280
Never?

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,850
Never.

32
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,670
Yeah.

33
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,560
That guy you picked up at the airport.

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,610
There's something you should know.

35
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,900
What do you mean?

36
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,130
He's not some innocent victim, Linc.

37
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,250
He and Christina have been exchanging
E- Mails, phone calls, you name it.

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,140
They've got some kind of plan. I
just haven't figured it out yet.

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
Thanks.

40
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,080
So what are you going to do with him, Linc?

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,270
Leave town, Michael.

42
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,890
Linc?

43
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,160
Where's Scylla?

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,920
- No.
- Where's Scylla?!

45
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,780
You ready?

46
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,810
Almost. Is that Sandinsky's phone?

47
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,550
Yeah.

48
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,170
Good luck.

49
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,610
Thanks, I may need it.

50
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,040
It's Michael again on Sandinsky's phone.

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,150
I thought he turned it off.

52
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,010
Well, now it's on. Track it.

53
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,200
Michael?

54
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,900
Hello, Christina.

55
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
I hope you're ready to talk.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,660
Let's start with Vincent Sandinsky.

57
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,820
Vincent Sandinsky the scientist?

58
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,140
He, uh, he's an old friend of mine.

59
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,950
A bit of a bore, don't you think?

60
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,910
But who cares about him?
I'd rather talk about you.

61
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,050
I'd rather meet you face to face.

62
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,500
Unless you're bringing me
Scylla, I'm not interested.

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,550
No Scylla, no meeting.

64
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,340
That's all I can offer.

65
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,440
What do you hope to accomplish?

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,580
I need your answer in ten minutes, and
that's the last time I'm calling back.

67
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,490
And found him.

68
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,680
He's in an industrial park in el portal.

69
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,950
Right up the coast.

70
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,710
All right, let's go.

71
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,180
You're lying, you're lying.

72
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,600
I don't work for the Company, six
words that never prove true.

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,810
Come on, man, this is over, look around!
What are you doing here?

74
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,990
- I swear I don't know anything, I don't know anything.
- What are you doing here?

75
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,160
I don't know what he's talking about.

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,470
I am here for a conference, that's all,
I don't know who told you otherwise.

77
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,650
I do, and Michael's also full of crap.

78
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,020
He's got no reason to lie.

79
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,900
Actually, he does, Michael's leading
us off the scent, so he can get in...

80
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,770
He doesn't want Christina to have
Scylla any more than we do.

81
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,220
It's not the first time he's lied to us.

82
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,250
Where is it?

83
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,270
- No.
- Linc.

84
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,710
Come on, Linc, he can't talk if he's dead.

85
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,310
You got three seconds.

86
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,500
- No.
- BURROWS!

87
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,530
Put the gun down.

88
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,000
Vincent and I need to talk.

89
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,290
Vincent? Yeah.

90
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,680
We had a deal.

91
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
New deal.

92
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,910
I'm taking charge.

93
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,680
Vincent and i are old friends.

94
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,580
Where'd you find him?

95
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,430
At an airstrip.

96
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,360
He's got something to do with Scylla.

97
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,370
Good.

98
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,010
Then you can help me find
it, can't you, Vincent?

99
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:05,270
And you can help me find Christina Scofield.

100
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:13,000
Dr. Sandinsky has been a Company operative
since... How long's it been, Vincent?

101
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,930
21 years.

102
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,240
21 years of service.

103
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,750
Scientist, statistician,
expert field combatant.

104
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,410
What brought you to Miami?

105
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,880
Does that help?

106
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,230
She invited me, okay? She invited me.

107
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,470
- Who?
- Christina Scofield.

108
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,710
I'm working with her.

109
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,970
Oh, that brings you full circle,
doesn't it, burrows?

110
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,900
But you knew that already.

111
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,480
When were you planning on telling me
that your mother was behind all this?

112
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,880
We just found out.

113
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,230
But bottom line is, you knew.

114
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,220
All of you!

115
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,990
On your knees.

116
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,870
You heard him, get down.

117
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,760
Oh, not you.

118
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,860
I don't need to make deals with
men who can't do their jobs.

119
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,960
If Bagwell is the only one
who is competent here,

120
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,020
- What? Are you serious?
- He'll do it alone.

121
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,890
Who do you think found this guy?

122
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,330
Where's Scylla?

123
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,410
I don't know.

124
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,560
I don't.

125
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,880
She doesn't tell me where she keeps it,
but I do know where she's staying.

126
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,740
A place called edgewater tower, room 1099.

127
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,970
You have today.

128
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,900
One day.

129
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,820
You're wasting time, burrows.

130
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,230
One day.

131
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,740
You tipped him off.

132
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,120
No, Bagwell.

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
You stay here.

134
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,030
Yeah, Theodore. He needs you.

135
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,960
But you'd better stay away from us.

136
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,310
This is where Michael's
signal is coming from?

137
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,860
Yeah.

138
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,430
Be careful.

139
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,160
Just stay here.

140
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,750
Check it out.

141
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,380
Let's go! Let's go.

142
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,080
He's leaving.

143
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,990
Come on, he can't be that far away.

144
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,290
Go.

145
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,480
Out.

146
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,650
Let's go.

147
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,230
All right.

148
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,580
Where is it?

149
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,820
You don't really expect me
to answer that, do you?

150
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,440
Actually, I do. Because
your life depends on it,

151
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,210
And considering your track record, I think it's safe to
assume that you're always looking out for number one.

152
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,780
I've waited 25 years for
this moment, Michael.

153
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,230
There's no way I can say
everything I want to say.

154
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,620
Why should I let you?

155
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,770
Because I'm your mother.

156
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,260
That's something you can't change.

157
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,040
It's something you can't take away.

158
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,160
It's nice to meet you, Sara.

159
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,440
In some ways, Michael's
done very well for himself.

160
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,830
In other ways, I'm not so sure.

161
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,370
Lincoln has led you down a dark path.

162
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,580
I make my own decisions.

163
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,100
You break Lincoln out of prison and he
goes to work for general Krantz.

164
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,500
And he has his reasons.

165
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,480
But if you're looking for some kind of common
ground between us, maybe that's it.

166
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,390
I don't want to see Lincoln working
for the Company, either.

167
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,700
At least you've stopped
making excuses for him.

168
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,140
I stopped making judgments.

169
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,480
Something I couldn't afford.

170
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,560
But that was a long time ago, and
that's not why we're here.

171
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,030
No.

172
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,320
You're right.

173
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,290
None of us wants to see Scylla
go back to the Company.

174
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:38,910
So, if we can put the past behind us,
maybe we can work something out.

175
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,320
Like what?

176
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,190
Like a deal.

177
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,960
"A deal"?

178
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,610
All right, you tell me where Scylla is,
and we'll work out the details later.

179
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,340
We'll go 50-50.

180
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,110
A mother-Son operation?

181
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,910
Maybe.

182
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,790
But first, Scylla.

183
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,790
Please, Michael, I know better.

184
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,720
We're very similar.

185
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,140
I know what it's like to look at the big
picture, see all the little moving parts...

186
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,300
How much easier it is to
think after the surgery.

187
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,790
I know you.

188
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:25,780
That's why you'll never be able to manipulate
me like you do the rest of the world.

189
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,890
You're running out of time.

190
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,920
All right, there's no one back here!

191
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,240
Well, they were here, but of course,
there's nobody here now.

192
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,590
'Cause that's what happens.

193
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,510
You know, this whole thing...

194
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,530
It's just...

195
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,590
It's just... crap!

196
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,610
We're always one move behind,
every step of the way.

197
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,560
Yeah, and it's gonna get worse now
that Bagwell is breathing down our backs.

198
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,540
How do you make that kind of mistake, huh?

199
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,110
And let that inbred get anywhere near us.

200
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,840
No, no, no, the first mistake
was working for Krantz.

201
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,480
Okay, that was the first mistake. What do you
think's going to happen now that he's in town

202
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,830
And he has his goons calling the shots?

203
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,010
What's going to happen now?

204
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,850
Yeah, I should've known better
than to get anywhere near this.

205
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,990
All right, you know what?

206
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,330
We should go. Let's go.

207
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,460
No, we can't go, because
you saw the photos, right?

208
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,740
You saw the photos, so you know
what he's going to do with them.

209
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,470
We should have known what
he was going to do with them!

210
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,440
That's what we should've...

211
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,470
Just calm down.

212
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,340
You know what, the deal is over.

213
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,250
You know it, I know it. Everybody knows it.

214
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,490
We're not getting out of here!

215
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,620
We're going to take a walk right to the gallows,
or somebody else is going to stab us in the back!

216
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,820
I did that walk and I survived.

217
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,450
Even if we win, do we win?

218
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,710
You don't believe that, do you?

219
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,370
Look, I'm going to do what I got to do.

220
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,410
If you don't want to roll
with me, that's fine.

221
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,510
- What is that?
- Rental receipt, a silver minivan.

222
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,140
What is this?

223
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,670
What do you know about this?

224
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,200
We found a whole box of
them down in little Cuba.

225
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,970
Guns, too.

226
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,500
What do you know about this?

227
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,050
She wanted me speak there.

228
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,790
About Scylla?

229
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,570
She said she'd give me the script
beforehand, that's all I know.

230
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,430
She said her interest
was purely scientific.

231
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,960
Her interest was financial.

232
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,780
She came to me about a
year ago with an idea.

233
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,760
Rather than build our organization with
Scylla as the permanent cornerstone,

234
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,620
She wanted to use the technology
to make a quick profit.

235
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:08,080
If certain events occurred, various nations might
feel the need for a more modern defense system,

236
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,340
And they'd come to us for the answers.

237
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,860
Solar weaponry.

238
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,040
Water desalinisation.

239
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,170
Now, what do you know about all this?

240
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,550
I told you all I know.

241
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,820
Well, I thought it was a crazy idea.

242
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,320
Plan of an amateur.

243
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,190
But I figured she'd be angry.

244
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,410
She wasn't allowed to hold a card.

245
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,040
Now, what was that?

246
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,000
I think it's more than that.

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,150
Really?

248
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,440
What did she tell you?

249
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,840
I know how the Company operates.

250
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,550
Shell corporations like Ecofield,
rampant misuse of funds.

251
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,420
You're literally sitting on a gold mine.

252
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,230
But your leadership only benefits you and
your friends ten generations in the future.

253
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:05,020
And you would like to see
the Company implode?

254
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,370
I want to see something happen.

255
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,170
You think too small.

256
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,650
Laos?

257
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,960
We'll all be dead before that pays off.

258
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,720
Uh, "laos", sir?

259
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,430
don't trouble yourself.

260
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,010
Burrows?

261
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,600
I got a question for your friend.

262
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,730
What is it?

263
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,630
Ask him what the letters "dmb" mean.

264
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,790
Do the letters "dmb" mean anything to you?

265
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,220
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,180
I thought you understood me.

267
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,900
She said her place is on the
same block as dade-Miami bank.

268
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,480
- Did you hear that?
- I got it.

269
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,480
He'd better be telling the truth.

270
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,970
See what else the doctor knows.

271
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,200
No... what's Christina's plan?

272
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,020
I don't know. I don't know.

273
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,840
Maybe we should've...

274
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,010
Maybe we should've followed
her or something.

275
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,640
Sit down for me.

276
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,690
How about I talk to her?

277
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,630
I might have some perspective.

278
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,160
She didn't leave me when I was six.

279
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,650
Okay.

280
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,480
I'm sorry we had to meet this way, Sara.

281
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,590
I'm sorry we had to meet at all.

282
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,350
Michael's been through a lot in the last year and
at some point, it's going to be too much for him.

283
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,450
Michael can handle it. He's never
known a life without change.

284
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,770
Oh, you say that like you know him.

285
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,300
Oh, I do.

286
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,350
Better than you.

287
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,030
I don't see how that's possible.

288
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,210
Well, you will when your child's born.

289
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,310
See, I wasn't sure at first, but
you do have that drawn look.

290
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,380
And I see the way you protect
yourself when you sense danger.

291
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,810
You don't even know you're
doing it. It's instinct.

292
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,140
And what is it you know
about maternal instinct?

293
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,000
I've tried to be a mother.

294
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,230
- Even to Lincoln.
- How can you say that?

295
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:40,460
You left them without so
much as an explanation.

296
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,000
But if Michael would listen...

297
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,780
You know what? You can stop.

298
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,610
You can't justify what you did.

299
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,950
Michael doesn't know you're
pregnant, does he?

300
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,320
What happened?

301
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,320
I got nothing.

302
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,380
Hello, joyce.

303
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,300
How are you? My name is
Don Self, Homeland Security.

304
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,890
don't worry, there's nothing the matter.
I'm just here doing a favor for my friend.

305
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,020
See, his mother passed away yesterday.

306
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,540
Okay, and her last will and testament
is in one of your security boxes.

307
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,500
It's actually box 6468.

308
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,160
Is he authorized to access it?

309
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,760
See, that's the problem. He's not.

310
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,450
But we're willing to fill
out all the paperwork...

311
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,430
I'm sorry. Only authorized individuals
are allowed to access safe deposit...

312
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,580
Listen, lady, I need to get in
that box. Where's your boss?

313
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,030
Sir? Sir, can I help you?

314
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,000
I need to get in my mom's safe deposit box.

315
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,350
Do you have a court order? Dmb
policy prevents anyone...

316
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,720
Here's the policy. Okay, I need
to open box 6468. Right now.

317
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,640
- Name's Don Self, Homeland Security.
Excuse me, mr. Frank?

318
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,670
Number 6468 was accessed a minute ago.

319
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,490
He just left. It was the guy
with the silver suitcase.

320
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,880
There he is. Hey, that looks like
the guy from the Ambassy.

321
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,600
Mr. Banerjee, how are you?

322
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,470
I'm trying to reach Christina hampton.

323
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,260
She's in a meeting right now.

324
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,780
If I don't talk to her before
5:00, the deal is off.

325
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,950
This is my final offer.

326
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,960
You're going to take me to Scylla,

327
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,490
And then you can walk.

328
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,990
No questions.

329
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,760
No one tells the general.

330
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,050
You can live the rest of your life like this
never happened, but Scylla is mine.

331
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,870
Lincoln would never let that happen.

332
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,580
He doesn't have to know.

333
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,070
Even as children, you couldn't agree.

334
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,420
You fought about everything.

335
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,830
The two of you couldn't be more different.

336
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,690
But you know that, don't you, Michael?

337
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,630
This isn't about Lincoln.

338
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,180
You have blue eyes, he has green.

339
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,130
He played with trucks.

340
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,410
You took apart the television set.

341
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:55,180
And I don't need to point out the
difference in IQ or temperament.

342
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,860
You know what I'm getting
at,don't you, Michael?

343
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,010
I don't have any idea what
you're talking about.

344
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,940
You've always known it deep in your heart.

345
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,750
You just had no one to confirm it.

346
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,090
Lincoln...

347
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,210
Isn't your brother.

348
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,800
It's true.

349
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,820
I should have told you before,

350
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,880
But you always looked up to him,

351
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,010
And I had no idea things
would happen like this.

352
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,930
You don't know what you're saying.

353
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,930
Have you ever seen pictures
of Lincoln as a baby?

354
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,190
- Yes.
- No.

355
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,040
There aren't any.

356
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,640
Your father didn't adopt him until
he was three years old.

357
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,210
His parents worked for the Company.

358
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,660
They were killed in an explosion in manila.

359
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,880
Aldo brought him home the next day.

360
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,680
He felt it was his duty.

361
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,430
He didn't ask me how I felt.

362
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,000
I- I never bonded with him
like mother and son.

363
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,290
He was always so angry.

364
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,910
Understandably so...

365
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,480
He was too young to remember his mother,

366
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,640
But he always knew something was missing.

367
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,730
I can't believe you're playing this card.

368
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,320
I'm sorry, Michael.

369
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,840
But I felt differently about you.

370
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,560
And you could tell.

371
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,480
That's why you always felt guilty.

372
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,490
Why you were always throwing
yourself over the cliff

373
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,820
After Lincoln was already
dead at the bottom.

374
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,800
It's why you went to prison
and pissed your life away.

375
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,010
You don't know why I did the things I did!

376
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,210
You weren't there!

377
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,070
Who knows what you could have accomplished.

378
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:22,550
But you always felt like you had
to make less of yourself

379
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,810
To make Lincoln look less
pathetic in comparison.

380
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,540
Lincoln was more of a brother to me

381
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,860
Than you were ever a mother.

382
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,050
You left.

383
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,780
He stayed.

384
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,550
He fed me.

385
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,620
Kept me off the streets.

386
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,830
Put me through school.

387
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,310
How?

388
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,820
By getting in trouble over and over
again, just like he is right now.

389
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,050
What do you mean, right now? Where is he?

390
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,310
He's out looking for Scylla,
and he's not going to find it.

391
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,270
Maybe you should call him and tell him.

392
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,030
Unless there's too much
bad blood between you.

393
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,100
Or no blood.

394
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Who's the guy in the hood?

395
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,620
Is it miael?

396
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,660
Oh, just relax.

397
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,910
Where is he?

398
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,600
All right, keep up with him, come on.

399
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,620
I am. Just shut up.

400
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,860
It's not that I don't want to help you.

401
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,650
It's just that I hate to see you
go running after him again.

402
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,290
- Michael.
- Come here!

403
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,950
- Michael...
- Come here.

404
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,290
Michael!

405
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,470
Where is he?

406
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,440
Okay.

407
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,550
You want to go running after him,

408
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,970
Flush your life down the
toilet once and for all?

409
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,250
Go ahead!

410
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,670
Where is he?

411
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,440
Why don't you tell me where he is, or
I'll kill you myself, I swear to God!

412
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,160
I'll kill you myself.

413
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,550
Michael!

414
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,390
Michael.

415
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,980
Michael!

416
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,530
Come on!

417
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,990
Tell me!

418
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,840
Where is he?

419
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,310
Where is he?

420
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,620
Where is Lincoln?

421
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,620
Fine.

422
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,550
There's an energy conference at the
Panda Bay hotel in about an hour.

423
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,540
He'll be there. That's the truth.

424
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,760
I'm sorry.

425
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,990
I'M... I dot know what to think.

426
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,760
Go. Go, go go.

427
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,140
Go find him.

428
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,790
I got her. Go.

429
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,490
If she gives you any trouble...

430
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,080
If she gives you any trouble...

431
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,680
I know. Just...

432
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,450
Go.

433
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,660
You have surpassed
expectations, Bagwell.

434
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,710
You're much more than an informant.

435
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,400
I multitask.

436
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,810
Well, if things go as well as expected here,

437
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,090
You'll be rewarded accordingly.

438
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,200
As a special liaison to the Company?

439
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,980
Yes.

440
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,240
What exactly does that entail?

441
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,390
Well, that would be up to you.

442
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:52,030
Most Company operatives choose
their own career path,

443
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,160
Though I can't say what would suit you.

444
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,500
What do sexual predators from
Alabama typically do,

445
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,290
Uh, aside from the obvious?

446
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,150
Those days are behind me, general.

447
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,520
What I lack in formal education,

448
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:11,550
I more than make up for in
natural skills and curiosity.

449
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,760
And as you've seen, my
loyalty knows no bounds.

450
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,360
Then you shouldn't have any
difficulty passing your final exam.

451
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,810
Now, you didn't expect that a
few phone calls on the sly

452
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,320
Would set you up for life, d you?

453
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,780
No, sir.

454
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm ready for anything.

455
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,550
Good. Then prepare for this.

456
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,490
When burrows brings Scylla back to us,

457
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,150
I will fly it safely back to los angeles,

458
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:43,400
And you will be the one to
put a bullet in his brain.

459
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,140
Sara?

460
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,830
What's going on in there?

461
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,320
Sara?

462
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,570
What do you want?

463
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,310
Oh, please, keep that open.

464
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,040
Why?

465
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,210
So you can lob more accusations
and assumptions out at me?

466
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,730
I haven't made any.

467
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,240
Lincoln is adopted.

468
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,330
And you're pregnant.

469
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,110
You don't deny it, do you?

470
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,110
You should tell him.

471
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,870
He'd be happy, even under the circumstances.

472
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,840
It really isn't any of your business.

473
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,850
I'm sorry.

474
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,710
Sometimes in-Laws overstep
their bounds, but...

475
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,190
You know, when it comes right down to it,

476
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,960
I am the only mother any of
you will ever have, so...

477
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,810
You shouldn't throw that away so easily.

478
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,680
Yeah, you know, the
only thing I get from you

479
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,310
Is a great example of the
mother I don't want to be.

480
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,550
Sara?

481
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,310
It doesn't have to be like this.

482
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,680
Yeah, it does.

483
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,940
That was your decision a long time ago.

484
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,670
Sara, can I just give you
one piece of advice?

485
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,040
Stay out of the bars.

486
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,460
- That's good advice.
- I have friends in AA.

487
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,020
They're only alcoholics.

488
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,780
I can only imagine what it's like for you,

489
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,260
Trying to stay off the smack.

490
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,890
It's morphine.

491
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,100
Hospital-Grade morphine.

492
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,590
Christina Scofield will not be
leaving Miami tonight.

493
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,730
I want eyes at every airport and gas
station between here and Atlanta.

494
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,870
And I want the names of everyone
attending that conference.

495
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,660
I thought you might be asking that question,
so I called the front desk of the hotel.

496
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,530
Said I was from the newspaper.

497
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,890
Excuse the spelling.

498
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,330
These are all scientists.

499
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,730
I told you.

500
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,000
Those are the speakers. The names
below are "special guests".

501
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,240
Sounded like bigwigs from
all over the world.

502
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,190
"Frederich, Carlotto, Linarte, Ban...

503
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,110
" "Banerjee"?

504
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,800
Naveen Banerjee?

505
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,060
Who is that?

506
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,520
The son of prime minister Nandu Banerjee.

507
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,680
He has a known interest in
solar weapons technology.

508
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:34,190
This will all be over by the end of the day.

509
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,950
Come on, Linc, where are you?

510
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,380
It's Linc.

511
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,160
- You know what to do. - Linc, it's me.

512
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,150
Call me when you can. We got to talk.

513
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,790
Mahone!

514
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,780
This way!

515
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,520
Christina.

516
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,640
don't move.

517
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,340
Or I'll kill you both.

518
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,140
Where is he?

519
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,790
Where did he go?

520
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,420
There.

521
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,100
- Where is he?
- Right there, right there.

522
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,510
Lincoln, stop!

523
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,540
Why?

524
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,540
Wait, wait.

525
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,860
That's the hotel.

526
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,390
The energy conference.

527
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,320
That's right- It's today.

528
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,660
The silver van.

529
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,360
The rental van.

530
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,880
They want us here.

531
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,070
Something's up.

532
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,540
What the hell is going on?

533
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,200
Downey.

534
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,900
It's for a getaway.

535
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,480
Lincoln, no!

536
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,660
Where are you?

537
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,510
Running. Burrows is on my ass.

538
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,490
Are you okay?

539
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,360
I was worried you didn't get away.

540
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,970
This whole thing could go to hell.

541
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,420
I'm fine. I'm right on time.

542
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,460
See you soon.

543
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,470
Down.

544
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,400
Down.

545
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,880
Good girl.

546
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,620
He'll never forgive you for this,
and neither will his brother.

547
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,360
Soon, this will all be behind us.

548
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,770
Maybe I can meet my grandson one day.

549
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,590
Nomaash kaar.

550
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,650
My apologies, Naveen.

551
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,890
Where have you been?

552
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,470
I was told that you would call.

553
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,430
I got hung up on a few
details for this evening.

554
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,690
You spoke with downey?

555
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,980
It did very little to reassure me.

556
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,430
I need to speak to dr. Sandinsky.

557
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,570
Oh, you haven't heard?

558
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,040
Dr. Sandinsky had a family emergency.

559
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,030
His wife was in a terrible accident.

560
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,890
I spoke with him this morning.

561
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,150
He took a private jet out this afternoon.

562
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,380
It's very late to be making
these decisions now.

563
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,760
Yes, but you've come all this way.

564
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,140
You are prepared to give
your speech, aren't you?

565
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,340
Fine.

566
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,260
But in light of the fact

567
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,320
That I did not speak with the
doctor, I'll amend my offer.

568
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,010
$1 million in exploratory research.

569
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,510
The rest will follow in the weeks to come.

570
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,380
That's very generous, Naveen.

571
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,470
History will thank you.

572
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,390
Your country will thank you.

573
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,400
See you soon.

574
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,110
May I have your attention, please?

575
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,420
We're about to begin.

576
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,370
Thank you. Welcome to Miami beach.

577
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,460
And thank you for attending the
first global conference of its kind,

578
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,910
Where great minds will meet to
explore our energy future.

579
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,160
The importance of finding new ways to power
our world should not be underestimated.

580
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,970
It's running.

581
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,340
They rented this in Linc's name.

582
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,700
Okay. Look at this.

583
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,250
These passports.

584
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,180
It's us.

585
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,470
It's a setup.

586
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,200
For what?

587
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,780
It's a setup!

588
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,530
Thank you.

589
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,170
It's 5:00.

590
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,950
If burrows doesn't call in the next
five minutes, you're going downtown.

591
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,190
General, you should see this.

592
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,750
In the city of Miami.

593
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,980
Today, the venue will
be the Panda Bay hotel,

594
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,830
Where security it high in light
of the important guests.

595
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,460
This includes Naveen Banerjee, son of
prime minister Nandu Banerjee,

596
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,220
Who is scheduled to be the
event's keynote speaker.

597
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,720
Banerjee's fragile political position

598
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,920
May leave him vulnerable to
criticism on the world stage.

599
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,550
- He has aggressively sought to place his ideas
- Christina's plan.

600
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,950
What she needed to profit from Scylla.

601
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,300
An incident that'll domino
into global warfare.

602
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,150
...in the search for new forms of greener
energy like sun and wind and how this idea

603
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,210
Krantz.

604
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,330
You're out.

605
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,220
It's over now.

606
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,470
No!

607
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,270
You do it.

608
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,360
Do it!

609
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,530
Hey!

610
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,400
You need a pass!

611
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,970
At this point in our history, solar power
accounts for less than one-Tenth

612
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,640
Of one percent of the total
power generated in our world.

613
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,950
And in the next ten years, that number
should increase to ten percent,

614
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,630
But it's still not enough.

615
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,440
We must strive to seek new alternatives

616
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,530
So that we can break this
cycle of oil dependence.

617
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,280
We cannot do that without your help.

618
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,060
So that's why we're here today:

619
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,080
To explore our new energy future,

620
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,010
And envision a new tomorrow.

621
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,440
Now, our first guest is an
author and an entrepreneur.

622
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,260
As well as having a notable heritage,

623
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,840
He has spoken to audiences across the world.

624
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,480
Please welcome, Naveen Banerjee.

625
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,830
Thank you, thank you.

626
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,360
Good evening, my friends.

627
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:07,980
It is my pleasure to be here with you
today in this beautiful city of sunlight.

628
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,900
Throughout the United States,

629
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,160
I find there to be great interest

630
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:19,130
In the changing way that
we all power our world.

631
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,320
Many times I have been approached...

632
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,600
No!

633
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,870
With a proposal to reinvent the wheel.

634
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,220
New resources...

635
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,530
No!

636
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,600
Michael!

637
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,690
Linc!

638
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,010
We've got to go.

639
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,740
She set the whole thing up.

640
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,320
She set the whole thing up.

641
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,650
Do you have it?

642
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,090
Right here.

643
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,090
How'd it go?

644
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,320
The van was there with the passports.

645
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,540
I just got off the phone with
our contact at the bank,

646
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,080
And they've got clean video of burrows
trying to access the box.

647
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,560
He must have trashed the hotel room.

648
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,520
His hands were all over the shells.

649
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,460

Lincoln's right back where he started.

It's too bad about Michael I know you, uh...
