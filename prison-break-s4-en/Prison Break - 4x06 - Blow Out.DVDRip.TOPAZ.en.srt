00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,717
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:06,877
Someone at Homeland Security
did an enhanced image search on you.

3
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:08,920
- Who?
- His name is Don Self.

4
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:25,963
Yes?

5
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:31,939
What do you say you give me
that little piece of paper in your hand?

6
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:37,141
From now on, I'm asking that everyone
keep their card on them at all times.

7
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:39,212
Where's the bird book?

8
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:41,584
- Bird book?
- Where is the book?

9
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:44,483
- Someone was following me.
- Is this the guy?

10
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,251
Yeah.

11
00:00:46,427 --> 00:00:49,089
- Who's that?
- That's the man who killed my son.

12
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:50,959
Now he's come to kill us.

13
00:01:06,814 --> 00:01:09,214
Don't get use to it.

14
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,984
SparkleKid. Gate 8.

15
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:23,287
Excuse me.

16
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:25,955
Hi, there.
I would like to place some bets, please.

17
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:34,768
I'd like to place an exacta on Captain Brody
and Mr. Hooper in the first race.

18
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:38,036
All right. Twenty dollars, please.

19
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:40,407
- Thank you.
- I think you made a mistake here.

20
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:44,108
I wanted a quinella for Captain Brody
and Mr. Hooper in the first race.

21
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:47,816
- You gave me an exacta.
- That's what you told me you want...

22
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:50,617
No, it's not what I told you,
and I want you to fix it.

23
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:54,319
- I gave you what you asked for.
- No, you didn't. What kind of place is this?

24
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:56,690
- Lf you'll just calm down.
- I'm not... Calm down?

25
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:59,355
What are you talking about?
I want you to fix this.

26
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:02,526
You gave me the wrong bet.
I placed a bet for a quinella...

27
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:05,400
...on Doctor Brody and Mr. Hooper.
You gave me an exacta...

28
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:08,007
Somebody's freaking out
on one of the clerk's inside.

29
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:09,734
I'll check it out.

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,883
<i>Hey, Louis, we've got a disturbance
by the windows.</i>

31
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:28,492
I'm on my way.

32
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:34,001
- What the hell kind of place is this anyway?
- Lf you'll just calm down...

33
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:37,262
I'm not... What are you talking about?
I want you to fix this.

34
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:39,804
This... You gave me the wrong bet.

35
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:43,175
...it's not an exacta.
- That's what you told me.

36
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:45,835
- I remember...
- End of the line, please.

37
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:48,880
I'm not leaving this place
until I talk to the guy who makes...

38
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,213
- Maybe we could just not be hysterical...
- I'm not being hysterical.

39
00:02:52,387 --> 00:02:55,413
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm the operations manager. Take it easy.

40
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,957
You run background checks on your
employees or do you let cons work here?

41
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:01,891
- There are no cons working here.
- What is she doing? "Mave."

42
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:05,191
- Mave, do you have a record, Mave?
- Excuse me, sir. Hey, calm down.

43
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,594
I didn't touch nothing.

44
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:10,932
I got a problem here. Did you come to help
me or did you come to give me a hard time?

45
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:13,235
Excuse me, miss?

46
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:19,211
Oh, thank you. I would have been in trouble
if I'd lost those.

47
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,406
My boss would have gone
up one side of me and down the other.

48
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,050
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

49
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,932
Why is she looking at me like that?

50
00:03:42,103 --> 00:03:44,503
She wasn't yelling at anyone.
We'll take care of it.

51
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:46,105
I'm not yelling at anyone.

52
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:48,265
Oh, sorry, sir.

53
00:03:55,783 --> 00:03:57,307
I'll keep an eye on the monitors.

54
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,451
He's heading back.

55
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:08,686
Let's go.

56
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:13,528
<i>- How's it look?
- I'm getting a clear signal. We're all set.</i>

57
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:17,034
Cardholder number four, you're up.

58
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:27,506
- Here you go, darling.
- Thanks.

59
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:31,049
Clocker said, SparkleKid
was edging on the track record at prep.

60
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:32,618
Oh, that's great, honey.

61
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:36,249
Let's go.

62
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:03,774
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

63
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:08,445
<i>And welcome to the first race of the day
here at Los Alamitos.</i>

64
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:15,389
<i>The starters are at the gate.</i>

65
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:18,227
<i>And they're ready to go.</i>

66
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:24,695
<i>- And they're off and running.
- What the hell?</i>

67
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,835
It stuck. The gate stuck.

68
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:32,244
I'm gonna talk to the manager.

69
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:14,817
- We're here to see the manager.
- Yes, sir.

70
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,416
It's gonna...

71
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:21,323
You better have a damn good explanation
about what just happened here.

72
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:23,224
All right, I'll get back at you.

73
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:26,730
- We're looking into it right now, Mr. Edison.
- Cue up the tape, now.

74
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:39,740
We've made contact.
Fifteen percent and counting.

75
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:45,643
Right there. It stuck.

76
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:51,791
- What happened to his gate?
- I don't know.

77
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,018
<i>- Louis, you better come down here.
- Not now.</i>

78
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:57,961
<i>We found something on Gate 8,
where SparkleKid was placed.</i>

79
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,964
- I'll be right back.
- I'm coming with you.

80
00:07:16,317 --> 00:07:17,716
Did we get it?

81
00:07:18,152 --> 00:07:20,620
A hundred percent. We're all there.
Card's all there.

82
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:27,959
- Was this jerk a loser before?
- It's all your fault.

83
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:31,962
We're gonna need backup.

84
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:33,998
You better go before you get recognized.

85
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:37,399
- Someone has to be look...
- I'll take care of it, go, go.

86
00:07:37,838 --> 00:07:40,534
All right, all right. Break it up, guys.
Let's go.

87
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:45,375
Let's go.

88
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,274
Hi, there. Excuse me.
I was wondering if you could help me.

89
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,350
I placed a bet on SparkleKid for my boss.

90
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,488
- Do you know what happened?
- Not right now, sweetheart.

91
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,051
Okay. My boss had me put more money
on him than I make in a week.

92
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:02,627
He's gonna flip out
when I tell him about this.

93
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:04,321
I'm not the right person to ask.

94
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:16,899
- But I put 500 here for Orca's Revenge...
- Talk to one of the window clerks.

95
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:19,103
But maybe I could add it to that?

96
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,046
Look, I can't help you, all right?
Now move it along, honey.

97
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:26,812
Okay, listen, I'm just trying
to ask you a couple of questions.

98
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:29,182
Yeah, well, you asked one too many.

99
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,427
How about this.
Why don't you help me find somebody...

100
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:38,122
...who could help me sort this out?
- Lf you don't take your hands off me...

101
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:41,200
...you're gonna have more to worry about
than an angry boss.

102
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:42,630
All right, well...

103
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:47,840
You take good care of yourself today,
officer.

104
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:57,775
Hey, excuse me. This is a restricted area.
You can't be back here.

105
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:59,146
I'm looking for a manager.

106
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,279
I'm getting the money back that I bet
on the horse that got stuck in the gate.

107
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:06,426
Hey, I said you can't be back there.
I need backup.

108
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:10,387
Hey!

109
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,802
- Where's Mahone?
- He's right there.

110
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,780
That's great. He's got the device.

111
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:32,985
We're screwed.

112
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:49,762
Mommy?

113
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:54,771
Go back to your room, okay, sweetheart?
Okay.

114
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:03,315
Oh, my God.

115
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,942
What happened to you?

116
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:08,084
Hey, sis.

117
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:27,502
- We have an issue.
- Good afternoon to you too, Andy.

118
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:30,439
I've been reviewing your roster
from the Northeast division.

119
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:34,206
Two of your top buyers
don't have valid social security numbers.

120
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,411
Care to explain that?

121
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:51,363
When I'm about to make a sale to a client,
I ask myself two questions:

122
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:54,763
Is the client being helped?

123
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,698
And are we getting paid?

124
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:03,243
There's a reason why
I was the top seller in the Northeast.

125
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:06,177
I don't get hung up on the details.

126
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:09,313
And what you're saying is?

127
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:15,115
There might be a typo or two in my reports,
but I'm pretty sure those checks cleared.

128
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:19,785
Fair enough.

129
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:58,554
You've had a busy morning, Frank.
Unlawful entry, resisting arrest.

130
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:00,324
It's not even lunchtime.

131
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:09,306
You're trying to put the fear of God into me.
Mission accomplished.

132
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:14,142
Listen, sergeant, I know a descent amount
about the justice system...

133
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:18,752
...enough to know that if you wanted to,
you could drop this whole thing...

134
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,410
...and save a lot of trouble
for everybody, huh?

135
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:28,024
- What kind of phone is this?
- It's a Japanese brand, off market.

136
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:31,089
What about the ankle monitor
you're wearing?

137
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:37,694
I've been on the straight and narrow and
it's due to come off in a couple of days.

138
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:40,732
Put your fingers in the ink.

139
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,742
I had 2 grand go up in smoke
because of a bum gate.

140
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:48,609
I mean, I got a little upset for a second.
Who wouldn't?

141
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:51,713
Let's talk about this.

142
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:56,113
Should we talk about how you punched an
officer or how you tried to flee the scene?

143
00:12:56,657 --> 00:12:57,817
Pick a felony.

144
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,354
Take him to the holding cell.

145
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,865
<i>What do you mean he got arrested?
What happened?</i>

146
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,063
It's a long story.

147
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,300
But we need you to get Mahone
and the device out. Can you do that?

148
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:20,675
You think that every time you guys screw
up, I can magically make things disappear?

149
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:23,715
We ain't interested in your excuses.
Can you do it or not?

150
00:13:23,884 --> 00:13:27,877
Lincoln, you know what, I'll call you back.
Excuse me, who are you? What is this?

151
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:31,115
I'm Brian. I work in the IT Department.

152
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,692
We're getting some registry inconsistencies
on the server...

153
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:37,194
...so I'm just running
a few routine spot checks.

154
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:42,028
- So you just barge in here without asking?
- I have Level 2 clearance, see?

155
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:45,262
It's what I do. I go into people's offices,
I fix their computers.

156
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:47,964
I figured it was better to do it
when you weren't here.

157
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:50,736
You gotta go. Don't come back in here.

158
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:55,005
Sure thing. You're all set.

159
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:04,950
- So, what's the word?
- Self's on it.

160
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:09,056
"On it," as in he's getting Mahone out?

161
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:11,561
- He said he'd handle it.
- What's there to handle?

162
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:14,428
Self yanked us all out of prison
for way bigger charges.

163
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:17,764
- Getting Mahone out should be easy.
- Yeah.

164
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:29,445
Let's concentrate on finding
the next cardholder.

165
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:32,881
As soon as we get the device back
we'll move forward.

166
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:35,146
Would you walk us through
what we know so far?

167
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:36,482
Sure.

168
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:40,855
Howard Scuderi runs Agrisow which is the
world's largest agricultural conglomerate...

169
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:42,723
...and has huge holding's in Laos.

170
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:46,559
Which, given the current inflation, means
they are making money hand over fist.

171
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:14,324
"My friends are playing at the park."

172
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:18,288
Sweetheart, why don't you go play
in your room for a little bit.

173
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:26,269
How you feeling?

174
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,101
Better.

175
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,368
I made you a sandwich.

176
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:32,806
Thank you.

177
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:36,107
You never explained what happened.

178
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:44,356
Well, my car broke down
in the middle of the desert.

179
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:48,518
There was no one around for miles and
my cell phone was dead, so I walked here.

180
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:53,958
Hey, do you still have that owl,
that I sent from Germany?

181
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:55,226
Yeah.

182
00:15:55,402 --> 00:15:57,563
- I need to see it.
- Okay.

183
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:09,676
Thank you.

184
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:15,515
Oh, my God. Gretchen, is that?
Is that a real gun?

185
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,316
It is.

186
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:20,022
- You don't work for the IRS?
- I don't.

187
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:24,226
Who do you work for?

188
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:25,558
As of now...

189
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,396
...myself.

190
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:36,633
He attended Touro Law School
in Long Island.

191
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,716
He spent the next 18 years,
bouncing around the DOJ and DOD...

192
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:46,853
...before being dumped on the doorstep
of Homeland in '02.

193
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,647
Come in.

194
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:54,251
General.

195
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:56,351
What did you find out?

196
00:16:57,197 --> 00:17:03,158
I tried accessing Self's user account
but he has a tricky firewall system in place.

197
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:07,296
There's no easy way to get past it,
not without drawing attention.

198
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:10,932
So we still don't know
why he's interested in me.

199
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,406
Maybe if you gave me more time.

200
00:17:16,116 --> 00:17:18,175
I'll look into it.

201
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:31,096
Look, he's important.
Okay, he's doing a job for me.

202
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:34,428
- Well, your CI punched one of my officer's.
- I understand.

203
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:39,368
- You're lucky he's not charged with worse.
- I apologize for him, okay?

204
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:43,805
Look, I'm asking for a favor here.
Okay, from one badge to another.

205
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:46,172
When was the last time
you looked at your badge?

206
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:50,248
Because mine says "Issued by the city of
Los Angeles," not the federal government.

207
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:53,045
- Unless you get a court order...
- You wanna go that route?

208
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,246
You wanna get smart? Wanna get detained
at Guadalajara Airport...

209
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:59,790
...when you're coming back from visiting
your nana? How does that sound?

210
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,159
You ever hear of a no-fly list?
That's what my badge could do, okay?

211
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:07,296
Wanna see what else it could do?

212
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,440
I was starting to worry.

213
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:18,601
- Sign this.
- Yeah.

214
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:26,310
- These aren't release papers.
- I need you to sign that so I can...

215
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,716
- They're gonna run my prints...
- You punched a cop.

216
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:31,687
- Yeah, trying to save a mission.
- Keep your voice down, okay?

217
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,120
I did the best I could do.

218
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:36,023
You need to sign those
so I can collect Roland's device.

219
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:43,436
You want me to give up the one thing
that makes me valuable.

220
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:45,571
You knew the deal
when you came on board.

221
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:48,071
Okay, we all sacrificed a lot
to get this far.

222
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:51,642
You wanna flush it down the toilet
because you made a bad move?

223
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:22,340
Got it.

224
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:25,171
Self got the device. Mahone's still in jail.

225
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:29,916
- But Mahone, he's part of the team.
- Was.

226
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:33,244
Look, I feel just as bad about his kid
as everyone else.

227
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,151
- We can't blow this mission on one person.
- Oh, yeah? If I get popped tomorrow...

228
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:40,350
...you guys are gonna forget about me?
- Yeah.

229
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:45,225
Hey, listen, an assassin
is trying to hunt us down, okay?

230
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:48,826
That T-Bag character's out in the wind
with the keys to the castle.

231
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:51,869
We got enough problems
without having to worry about this guy.

232
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:53,403
You, shut up.

233
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,401
Okay. Alex has an alias.
If they run his prints, they're gonna find...

234
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:59,568
Not "if," when they run his prints.

235
00:19:59,746 --> 00:20:02,909
They're gonna figure out who he is
and that he's not in a supermax.

236
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,449
- Then they're gonna realize we're not...
- Michael?

237
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:12,581
Linc's right. We don't have a choice.
We move forward with the plan.

238
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,139
Agent Self.

239
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:50,056
I'm an associate of General Krantz.

240
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:56,934
Word has gotten back to the general
that you've been pulling information on him.

241
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:59,094
Why is that, Mr. Self?

242
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:02,439
I'm Homeland Security.

243
00:21:02,676 --> 00:21:06,578
It's my job to protect people
who make attractive terrorist targets.

244
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:10,045
People in upper ranks of military.
People like Krantz.

245
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:12,583
Is there a particular threat
I should know about?

246
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,316
Maybe you can debrief me
on the situation.

247
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,515
What's your division?

248
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:20,890
You wanna give me your clearance level?

249
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:25,555
I'm a hired contractor.

250
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:28,291
Right.

251
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:31,263
Well, I usually don't make a habit
of giving civilians...

252
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:35,636
...who corner me in underground parking
structures, classified information.

253
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,036
Okay? So if the general has a problem,
he can call me.

254
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:47,783
- Is there something else you wanna say?
- I think we got off on the wrong foot.

255
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:51,913
I'm just here to give you
a little friendly advice.

256
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:57,086
- What's that?
- The general, he likes his privacy.

257
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:04,132
That's all.

258
00:22:21,922 --> 00:22:23,287
Yeah, so that was Wyatt.

259
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:28,125
I gotta tell you, I'm not a big fan
of almost catching a bullet in my head.

260
00:22:28,295 --> 00:22:29,956
Well, now you know what it's like.

261
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:37,268
So how well do you know Mahone?

262
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:40,666
I know he wants to take down the Company
as much as we do.

263
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,206
You also realize he's a major liability.

264
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:46,368
I mean, if Wyatt could find me,
he could find Mahone.

265
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:48,646
- And then people are...
- So get him out.

266
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:51,306
I told you, I can't.

267
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:54,247
But I can get to him.

268
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:57,281
I mean, he can be touched.

269
00:22:57,457 --> 00:22:59,721
I don't know,
maybe Mahone is a standup guy...

270
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:04,262
...or maybe he likes to run his mouth
to work an angle. I'm not sure.

271
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:08,697
But if need be, I can get rid of that angle.

272
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:11,564
I can eliminate that threat.

273
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:15,934
- That's not an option.
- Oh, yes, it is.

274
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:21,646
Okay, because if a choice has to be made
between him or us...

275
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:32,886
Frank, I got some good news.

276
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:35,920
Oh, yeah, what's that?

277
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:38,186
I can cut you a break.

278
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,698
As easy as that?

279
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:45,605
I spoke with the manager
at the racetrack.

280
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:49,708
He said you were spotted with another male
Caucasian about 10 years your junior.

281
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,673
That sound about right?

282
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:53,472
Here comes the cops.

283
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:57,048
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- What was it?

284
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:59,977
The two of you were gonna go in there
and rob the vault?

285
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:01,882
Grab as much cash and get out?

286
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:04,922
- Someone has to be look...
- I'll take care of it, go.

287
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:08,525
Look, maybe you got a wife
to get home to.

288
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,262
Family.

289
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,330
If you give me the name of your accomplice,
I think we can change your charges.

290
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:17,535
- We work together. Help each other out.
- You're on your own.

291
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:24,005
You holler if you change your mind.

292
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:31,447
Let's talk about the fifth cardholder.

293
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:36,555
The general is requiring all the cardholders
to have their cards on them at all times.

294
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:39,749
So Scuderi will have his card too.

295
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:42,087
Scuderi has major security
around his house.

296
00:24:42,262 --> 00:24:43,752
Big fence, lot's of guard dogs.

297
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,161
- Where are the documents?
- These are from the county surveyors office.

298
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,825
It shows the layout of his property
and its proximity to every other house.

299
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:55,202
He has, surprise, surprise,
a top of the line electronic alarm system...

300
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,503
...that will alert him
if there's a breach in the structure.

301
00:24:58,678 --> 00:25:00,839
If we cut the power, the alarm goes off.

302
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:03,778
If we double the power
with a voltage spike...

303
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,216
...the alarm system, in order to protect itself
against an overload, will shut itself down.

304
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:10,356
- That's how we're getting in.
- Then what?

305
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:13,219
Look, I know what the score is.
It's every man for himself.

306
00:25:13,393 --> 00:25:17,591
You get left behind, you get locked up.
I signed on the dotted line like everyone.

307
00:25:17,764 --> 00:25:20,927
And I wanna know
exactly what I'm doing on this job.

308
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,032
I'm with Bellick on this one.

309
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:26,697
Maybe we should have a plan
for when the cops get here.

310
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:29,433
If Mahone squeals,
they're gonna come real quick.

311
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:33,739
He's a fed. How many deals
do you think this guy's made in his life?

312
00:25:33,913 --> 00:25:36,746
- You think he's gonna tuck tail between...
- Shut up.

313
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:42,020
We can sit here and debate what Mahone
is or is not gonna do for the rest of the day.

314
00:25:42,188 --> 00:25:46,318
But it comes down to this,
we cannot break him out of a police station.

315
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:56,462
One, two, three, four, five, six...

316
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:58,900
No. Too big.

317
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:33,498
Eight-by-ten.

318
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:46,213
- It's the lowest gage I could get.
- It's perfect.

319
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:59,357
Well, I guess...

320
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:05,137
I guess we're gonna leave him in jail.

321
00:27:05,738 --> 00:27:07,365
Is that a statement or a question?

322
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:12,101
It's just if something happens to Alex...

323
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:14,676
...if the Company finds him...

324
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:18,446
If the roles were reversed
and you were the one locked up...

325
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:21,883
...you really think Alex would risk it all
to get you out?

326
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:25,022
I mean, I don't know...

327
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:29,019
...but he was a federal agent,
I think he'd finish what he started.

328
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:31,755
I think he'd bring the Company down.

329
00:28:06,266 --> 00:28:10,566
- Can I help you with something?
- Yes, I'm here to see Frank Zwan.

330
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:13,763
- I'm a family friend.
- I'm afraid you can't see him right now.

331
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,636
He's about to be transported
for his arraignment.

332
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:28,514
Actually, I'd like to be there
for moral support.

333
00:28:28,688 --> 00:28:30,656
Could you tell me which courthouse?

334
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,399
Hello?

335
00:28:51,611 --> 00:28:52,942
Michael?

336
00:28:54,814 --> 00:28:57,248
Alex, look, I'm sorry.

337
00:28:57,417 --> 00:29:01,478
He found me. Wyatt. He showed up at
the station house where they're holding me.

338
00:29:01,654 --> 00:29:04,179
I don't know how he did it,
how he figured it out.

339
00:29:04,357 --> 00:29:06,257
- Let me call Agent Self.
- Michael, listen.

340
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:09,327
<i>- No, maybe he can get you moved.
- It's over for me. It's done.</i>

341
00:29:09,495 --> 00:29:12,259
And I'm not gonna say anything
about anything.

342
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:14,525
But you need to promise me something,
okay?

343
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:16,365
Okay, what?

344
00:29:16,536 --> 00:29:20,336
Promise me that you will get to Wyatt...

345
00:29:20,506 --> 00:29:22,440
...and you'll kill the son of a bitch.

346
00:29:23,276 --> 00:29:27,679
And then you'll call Pam
and you'll tell her that he's gone.

347
00:29:28,614 --> 00:29:32,516
All right, I promise.

348
00:29:33,152 --> 00:29:34,779
Okay.

349
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:41,155
Okay. Bye.

350
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:46,994
Ready to go?

351
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:50,426
Michael?

352
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:57,467
I'm his wife. I'm sorry, I'm still in shock.

353
00:29:57,643 --> 00:30:00,578
I'll be down this afternoon, thank you.

354
00:30:00,747 --> 00:30:02,374
Who are you?

355
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:05,210
I just have some things
I need to take care of.

356
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:07,419
You don't need to worry.

357
00:30:11,924 --> 00:30:15,621
You have this switch inside you.

358
00:30:15,795 --> 00:30:19,595
I don't know how
you could you just shut yourself off.

359
00:30:19,932 --> 00:30:23,993
You did it when Mom died,
did it with Emily.

360
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:28,440
Did it with me.

361
00:30:30,877 --> 00:30:33,107
I do it because it's...

362
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:38,750
It's just who I am.

363
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,350
No, it's not.

364
00:30:42,488 --> 00:30:44,922
- You used to be...
- I have to go.

365
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:49,355
But thank you, for everything.

366
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:55,463
So you're not here to take her?

367
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:59,594
If I was capable of being her mother,
I wouldn't have given you custody.

368
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:08,412
You be a good girl, okay?

369
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:14,717
- Bye, Emily.
- Bye, Auntie.

370
00:31:23,763 --> 00:31:25,663
I love you.

371
00:31:30,436 --> 00:31:34,304
- Will we see you again?
- I don't know.

372
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:55,590
Call me if it goes south.

373
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:27,683
<i>To listen to your messages, press one.</i>

374
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:30,755
<i>Hey, honey, it's me.
I'm at the grocery store.</i>

375
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,730
<i>I was planning to make grilled pork chops,
unless you're not in the mood for them.</i>

376
00:32:34,901 --> 00:32:36,528
<i>I hope you're having a great day.</i>

377
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,319
Hey, what are you guys doing?

378
00:32:55,488 --> 00:32:57,388
We'll call you when we're done.

379
00:32:57,557 --> 00:32:59,252
No, wait...

380
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:04,359
- Where are you guys?
- Almost ready.

381
00:34:32,952 --> 00:34:35,887
- You have a problem.
- What's that?

382
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:39,686
What can I do you for?

383
00:34:40,126 --> 00:34:43,823
I found some more inconsistencies
in your sales reports.

384
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,323
Actually, many more.

385
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:51,498
In fact,
it kind of looks like fraud actually.

386
00:34:53,873 --> 00:34:56,467
I knew you were rotten
from the beginning.

387
00:34:56,642 --> 00:34:59,975
And I want you in my office in five minutes
to walk me through this.

388
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:04,708
And if you can't,
well, I'm gonna call the authorities.

389
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:26,695
- What are you doing?
- Nice knowing you, sugar.

390
00:35:27,106 --> 00:35:29,040
Cole, wait.

391
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:39,048
I was traveling abroad
when he passed away.

392
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:41,618
Again, I'm very sorry.

393
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:44,388
Is this your husband?

394
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:53,522
- Yes.
- I need to see some identification...

395
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:56,827
...so I can sign over his personal belongings
to you.

396
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:06,402
So you and your spouse
had different last names?

397
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:09,412
- That's correct.
- I realize this is an inconvenience...

398
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:13,245
...but I need to see other documentation
proving you were married.

399
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:17,549
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

400
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,056
Sorry, ma'am. Rules are rules.

401
00:36:39,478 --> 00:36:42,914
<i>Hey, Mr. Pfeiffer, this is Crystal,
from Instahome, getting back to you.</i>

402
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:46,017
<i>Just to let you know,
that the security-deposit check cleared...</i>

403
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:49,484
<i>... and your one bedroom is ready.
Okay, thank you.</i>

404
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:12,170
Hi, I'm representing Frank Zwan.
I'm gonna need his jacket from you.

405
00:37:12,344 --> 00:37:14,608
- I'd been informed he's going indigent.
- He was.

406
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,807
His mother in Santa Barbara, however,
is not, and she retained me this morning.

407
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:26,284
- Be my guest.
- Much obliged.

408
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:39,129
Five...

409
00:37:42,842 --> 00:37:44,605
...four...

410
00:37:47,213 --> 00:37:48,544
...three...

411
00:37:51,116 --> 00:37:52,777
Sir. Sir.

412
00:37:52,952 --> 00:37:55,614
...two...
- Please take a seat.

413
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:04,822
...one.
- One.

414
00:38:26,552 --> 00:38:28,816
Let's go people. Move it.

415
00:39:16,468 --> 00:39:18,561
All right, let's get out of here.

416
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:14,349
I don't know
if you guys did this for the team...

417
00:40:14,526 --> 00:40:18,656
...or if you did it for me. And I don't care.

418
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:20,560
I just...

419
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:23,125
Thank you.

420
00:41:11,316 --> 00:41:12,340
Yes?

421
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,586
I got your message.

422
00:41:16,488 --> 00:41:19,048
I was wondering
when you were going to call.

423
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:24,394
You told my wife
you wanted me to turn myself in.

424
00:41:26,098 --> 00:41:29,090
Why don't you tell me where to go
and I'll meet you.

425
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:33,200
<i>- Let's get this over with.
- This thing is far from over...</i>

426
00:41:33,806 --> 00:41:35,535
...Alex.

427
00:41:35,874 --> 00:41:40,072
First I find Sara Tancredi here, then you.

428
00:41:40,879 --> 00:41:43,780
Seems like there's a great deal of things
for us to talk about.

429
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:46,247
Oh, no, no, no.

430
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:50,053
There's only one thing
for you and I to discuss.

431
00:41:50,522 --> 00:41:53,047
You worked for the Company once, Alex.

432
00:41:53,425 --> 00:41:56,326
You should know better
than to take things so personal.

433
00:41:56,495 --> 00:41:58,258
<i>I'm gonna wrap this up...</i>

434
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,866
...just in case you decided to trace this call,
but I promise you...

435
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:05,300
...we will meet again...

436
00:42:05,471 --> 00:42:09,567
...and when we do, I'm gonna show you
just how personal things can get.

437
00:42:11,477 --> 00:42:12,944
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

438
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,349
Cole Pfeiffer.

439
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,454
What's you gonna do now?

440
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:07,630
Who the hell are you?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
