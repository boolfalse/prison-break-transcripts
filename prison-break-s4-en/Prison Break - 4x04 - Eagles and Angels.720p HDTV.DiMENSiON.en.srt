1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,260
They refer to it as "Scylla."

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,660
It's like the company's black book.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,200
What's that? Wireless hard drive that swallows up

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,130
any electronic data within ten feet of it.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,960
And the information embedded in Scylla?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,700
If we can get close enough...

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,460
it's ours.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,160
If Scylla was like a pizza,

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,530
all we got's a slice.

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,330
So Scylla isn't one card,

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,630
it's six.

12
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,000
They killed my boy.

13
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,500
I need to find out who did it.

14
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,630
Please.

15
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,430
I have a bank account in Dubai. It's yours.

16
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,000
Please, please.

17
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,730
Hello?

18
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,530
Cole Pfeiffer,

19
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,700
Gregory White here.

20
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,800
I'll see you at GATE first thing tomorrow.

21
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,100
And I will personally hand you

22
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,460
your bonus check.

23
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,930
Sara Tancredi's

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
somewhere safe, ist she, Bruce?

25
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,700
So tell me, where is Sara?

26
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,400
Los Angeles?

27
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,300
Good job.

28
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,300
It wasn't a meeting

29
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,700
between two Scylla cardholders, Agent Self.

30
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,100
It was a meeting

31
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,700
between all six cardholders.

32
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,330
So now we know who has the other

33
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,630
five cards.

34
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,300
Hey. You got anything

35
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,200
off the video?

36
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,000
It's a camera phone 50 feet away.

37
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,030
So, it's pretty grainy.

38
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,000
Still printing.

39
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,430
You ever been on one of those?

40
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,360
Yeah.

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,430
I was still drinking at the time,

42
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,830
so I don't remember much.

43
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,000
Um,

44
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,000
told I was a lot of fun.

45
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,030
You?

46
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,930
No.

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,130
Not a lot of yachts where I'm from.

48
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,960
I always kind of wanted to live on one.

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,800
I thought it'd be nice to have the ocean as my front yard.

50
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,260
The ocean is

51
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,460
your front yard.

52
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,600
What's wrong with the SS Minnow back there?

53
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,830
Nothing.

54
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,930
You really

55
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,760
want to drop that thing in the water someday

56
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,860
and sail off to parts unknown?

57
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,200
Yeah, why not?

58
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,930
As long as it's you and me.

59
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,530
I like the sound of that.

60
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,230
SUCRE: Yo, papi.

61
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,300
We got something.

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,060
One day.

63
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,130
What've we got?

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,930
Uh, we got a, we got a license plate.

65
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,900
It's a printout from the camera phone.

66
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,160
BELLICK: The numbers are

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,230
fuzzy, though. The whole damn thing's fuzzy.

68
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,160
Forget the numbers.

69
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,360
What's that next to the plate?

70
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,330
Looks like a sticker.

71
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,800
SUCRE: DMV? That's a flag.

72
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,200
SARA: It's a diplomatic plate.

73
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,130
The Six Ps, guys.

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
When I supervised 32 COs

75
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,330
back at Fox River-- it was the Six Ps

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,400
made it happen.

77
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,600
Can you blow it up?

78
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,030
I need to see more detail.

79
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,160
I'm already on it.

80
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,830
Prior, Planning, Prevents,

81
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,330
Piss-Poor, Performance. How about you

82
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
quit shaking your ass and say what's on your mind?

83
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,030
The second step.

84
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,130
Deciphering the cards.

85
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,830
The break-in. We need to plan.

86
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,160
Agent Self will provide that information.

87
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,060
You worked with Whistler.

88
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,600
Didn't he say anything about a location?

89
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,660
Wasn't that in his bird book?

90
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,030
Which T-Bag has.

91
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,430
If he made it out of Sona alive.

92
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,730
Finding where the break-in is doesn't mean anything

93
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,100
if we don't have the cards.

94
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,630
ROLAND: Here's your flag.

95
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,430
MAHONE: Algeria? Turkey.

96
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,000
Find out where the Turkish Consul is in town.

97
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,430
You know what? Get with the program.

98
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,430
You're up.

99
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,360
Uh, his name's Erol Tabak.

100
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Consulate is downtown. Yeah, but

101
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,400
we can't get into the consulate.

102
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,830
We can follow him from there.

103
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,660
SARA: Michael.

104
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,560
I'm gonna stay back

105
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,900
and work on the video.

106
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,630
Okay.

107
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,000
One day. one day.

108
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,400
Cole Pfeiffer.

109
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,730
How are ya?

110
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,900
Cole.

111
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,960
Pfeiffer.

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,330
P-f-e-i-f-e...

113
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Damn it!

114
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,730
Cole Pfeiffer.

115
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,730
How are ya?

116
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,800
No.

117
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,300
No.

118
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,330
Call me Cole, please.

119
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,530
P-f-e-i-f... e...

120
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Damn!

121
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,100
Breaking down

122
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,030
the captivity of negativity.

123
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,460
That's what we're doing here.

124
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,600
That's what we're doing here at GATE.

125
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,500
And I would encourage all of you to...

126
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,200
Huh.

127
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,960
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,960
...f-e-r.

129
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,300
P-f-e-i-f...

130
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,430
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,530
SUCRE: What do diplomats usually do?

132
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,660
Not a whole lot, but they park anywhere they want.

133
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,900
Put this on the dash.

134
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,700
Can we get any closer?

135
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,230
That's our guy.

136
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,100
Yeah?

137
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,500
We're copying.

138
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,800
He's got the card on him.

139
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,060
SUCRE: Hell yes.

140
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,200
That's the wife?

141
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,560
Sign me up.

142
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,930
You lost it.

143
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,100
How?

144
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,160
Dude, I don't know

145
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,460
what to tell you other than you lost it.

146
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,230
It's gone, man.

147
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,130
We lost it.

148
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,200
SUCRE: Wha!

149
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,200
How did we lose him?

150
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,260
We're right next to him.

151
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,760
He's not the cardholder.

152
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,060
She is.

153
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,260
We gotta get out ohere now before we get made.

154
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,400
Come on, go! Go!

155
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,600
You know what we've got in common, right?

156
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,660
What?

157
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,230
We both live in the real world

158
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,960
as opposed to these other knuckleheads.

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,460
So that whole prior planning

160
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,760
thing you were talking about,

161
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
if you got something on your mind

162
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,760
and no one else is interested, you just run it by me, okay?

163
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,860
And we'll just leave it at that.

164
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,730
All right.

165
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,660
Hello?

166
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,700
Sara?

167
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,760
Hey, it's Don Self.

168
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,200
Listen, um,

169
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,300
I have sbad news.

170
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,900
Bruce Bennett was found dead

171
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,430
in his apartment this morning.

172
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,630
I'm sorry.

173
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,260
Lisa, come in.

174
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,000
This will be quick.

175
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,230
I know you're on a schedule.

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,460
The value of the kip

177
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,100
is at ten right now.

178
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,600
I'll let you know as soon as it reaches 15.

179
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,930
At that point, you'll have to leave immediately.

180
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,560
I have my bags with me.

181
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,500
I could go now.

182
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,800
Don't you have that event tonight?

183
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,600
Yes.

184
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,730
But I...

185
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,100
It's important to keep up appearances.

186
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,600
Not arouse suspicion.

187
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,800
Fine.

188
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,660
I have no doubt in your leadership

189
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,030
abilities, Lisa, but... Good.

190
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,900
Nor do I.

191
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,460
So I won't keep you any longer.

192
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,260
Please...

193
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,460
be safe.

194
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,500
There she is.

195
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,400
All right, do what you gotta do.

196
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,760
Be next to her for two minutes so the device can copy the card.

197
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,860
I'll get it.

198
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,500
Take a seat. Take a seat.

199
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,260
See the three suits?

200
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,260
Forming a triangle around her?

201
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,600
Those are private contractors.

202
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,760
The Company would only do that

203
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
for the inner circle.

204
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,600
We're not getting anywhere near that lady.

205
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,000
Not today. Great.

206
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,860
What's wrong?

207
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,560
Hey, Teddy.

208
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,660
Well, if it ain't the Brothers Grim.

209
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,660
Easy, Linc. Remember, we need him.

210
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,630
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

211
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,830
I was thinking about maybe getting me a career in pictures.

212
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,530
Hey! If anyone's

213
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,260
got a right to be pissed-- it's me.

214
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,800
You put me out to pasture back in Panama.

215
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,560
Left me for dead.

216
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,930
Whh makes it the third time, I believe. So, congratulations,

217
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,060
you got yourself a turkey. Where's the bird book?

218
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,500
Bird book?

219
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,530
Where's the book?!

220
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,430
Ooh, look who's looking, pretty.

221
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,530
Look who's looking.

222
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,830
I don't think

223
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,600
the two of you are supposed to be carousing around

224
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,000
the Angel City any more than I am.

225
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,000
You don't know what you've gotten yourself into,

226
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,460
Teddy. But if you dot want to find out,

227
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,130
you're gonna tell us where that bird book is.

228
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,760
You're gonna let me go right now

229
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,730
or all of us are going down together.

230
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,060
Your choice.

231
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,160
Linc, come on.

232
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,430
Let's go, Linc!

233
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,400
WYATT: Tancredi. T-A-N...

234
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,700
C-R-E-D-I.

235
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,000
Make it a buckshot across the grid.

236
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,530
35-mile radius.

237
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,300
If she or any of those other names come up, call me.

238
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,760
FEMALE VOICE: Confirmed.

239
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,530
Where are you?

240
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,630
Los Angeles.

241
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,730
Trailing Dr. Sara Tancredi.

242
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,430
I ask for the knights, you're chasing a pawn.

243
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,200
She's irrelevant.

244
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,600
Not to Scofield.

245
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,600
If anyone knows what rock he's hiding under, it's her.

246
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,600
What about Gretchen?

247
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,160
I'm having her softened up,

248
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,000
but I question the merit of keeping her alive.

249
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,500
I don't think you should allow...

250
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,130
She must know something.

251
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,960
She lives

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,760
until she talks.

253
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,460
Now, I have something else I need you to do for me.

254
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,060
It seems a former employee

255
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,160
is looking into Scylla.

256
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,030
T-Bag's in town?

257
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,200
Yeah, but we lost him.

258
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,560
He could be anywhere by now.

259
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,660
It's not where he is. It's what he's doing.

260
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,730
He blew this whole thing for all of us.

261
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,000
Where's Sara? The boat.

262
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,800
SARA: Of course

263
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,030
it's my fault that he's dead.

264
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,130
It's not true. We both know it is.

265
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,330
I shouldn't have called him.

266
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,100
I knew that. I should never have reached out to him.

267
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,160
I shouldn't have involved him in any...

268
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,600
Bennett chose to help you.

269
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,760
The Company killed him, not you.

270
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,960
Listen to me, Sara. This is...

271
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,700
This is not your fault.

272
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm sorry.

273
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,530
I'm really sorry.

274
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,530
Hi. Can I help you?

275
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,960
With that smile you have, I'm Cole Pfeiffer.

276
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,630
Mr. Pfeiffer, uh, welcome to Los Angeles.

277
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,530
No, please.

278
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,600
Call me Cole.

279
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,700
Uh, Mr. White is looking forward to meeting with you,

280
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,200
uh, Cole, but he's just running

281
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,660
a few minutes late.

282
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,600
Precisely how few minutes are we talking about?

283
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,300
Oh, it shouldn't take long.

284
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,100
You can have a seat right over there.

285
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,660
Oh. Oh, I almost forgot.

286
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,160
You already have a message.

287
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,430
I do?

288
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,000
Mm-hmm. Mr. Xing called.

289
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,260
Twice.

290
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,330
I guess your reputation precedes you.

291
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,430
I guess so.

292
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,230
Don Self.

293
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,130
When did they find the body?

294
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,330
This morning.

295
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,860
They're saying it was a suicide,

296
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,360
but you and I know better.

297
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,560
So I need to ask you something very important, okay?

298
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,400
Did Bruce Bennet know where you are now?

299
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,560
I don't know.

300
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,760
Because if he did,

301
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,900
there's a damn good chance

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,100
that the Company does now too.Okay?

303
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,730
So you need to work double time.

304
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,960
Get some eyes in the back of your head, you understand?

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,360
Look, I appreciate the motivational speech,

306
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,660
but how about you figure out

307
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
where we have to break in so we can

308
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,630
decode those cards?

309
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,600
I've, I've got

310
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,730
some guys doing some digging, okay?

311
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,030
Actually, you might have two.

312
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,030
Well, what are you... what are you talking about?

313
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,000
His name is Theodore Bagwell.

314
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,400
He was with us in Panama,

315
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,030
and now he's here in Los Angeles,

316
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,860
and he has a book that used to belong

317
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,300
to Whistler, and Mahone thinks...

318
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,800
Mahone thinks this book has a plan for the break-in.

319
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,360
You've got to be kidding me.

320
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,530
I wish I were.

321
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,400
You've reached Jasper Potts.

322
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,600
Leave a message.

323
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,730
Hey, it's me. Listen, I need that information

324
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,860
we talked about, like yesterday, you understand?,

325
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,330
Call me back. Call... me... back

326
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,300
as soon as possible.

327
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,530
Lisa Tabak.

328
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,800
Wife of the Turkish Consul.

329
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,860
Married four years, children-- none.

330
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,800
Listed as the logistician

331
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,060
in the executive profile for SENSA,

332
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,030
a privately funded think tank with offices in D.C,

333
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,600
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.

334
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,700
Yeah, and the only thing

335
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,030
I want to know about this chick is her schedule.

336
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,560
What she's doing, where she's going.

337
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,000
We might not have that kind of time.

338
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,100
This morning, when she first got out of the car,

339
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,800
she had a suitcase.

340
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,630
Well, let's check the airlines, match her name against

341
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,230
aparting flights.

342
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,060
Maybe she's already gone.

343
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,230
I don't think so.

344
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,030
If she's going anywhere today,

345
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,700
it's gonna be on the red eye.

346
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,260
According to this press release, Lisa Tabak is being honored

347
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,700
at some charity shindig downtown.

348
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,900
Well, that's great. That's where we'll get her.

349
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,100
What's the benefit for?

350
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,960
She's the top donor of an organization

351
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,600
called Eagles and Angels.

352
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,130
Eagles and Angels?

353
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,400
You've heard of it?

354
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,800
When a police officer dies in the line of duty,

355
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,560
he's an Eagle.

356
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,230
The ones he leaves behind are Angels.

357
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,730
That's a benefit for the Association of Law Enforcement.

358
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,660
If you're gonna get near her,

359
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,330
it's gonna be with about half the cops in L.A.

360
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,560
Jasper, where the hell you been?

361
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,530
-Thinking.  -Thinking?

362
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,060
Come on, the only thing you ould be thinking about

363
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,460
is what I asked you to get for me.

364
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,960
Did you find the location?

365
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,830
Yes, yes, and don't say anything else, okay?

366
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,500
I heard clicks yesterday on my phone.

367
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,460
All right, settle down, all right? I'm coming to you.

368
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,160
It doesn't matter, you know, cause you're never gonna

369
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,060
be able to get in, not where they're keeping it.

370
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,260
I should have never helped you out. I...

371
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,230
Just relax, okay? I'm coming to you right now.

372
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,430
Think they're strong enough?

373
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,800
Together they should be.

374
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,430
That everything on the list.

375
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,560
You sure we have to steal them?

376
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,230
It's the one thing we need that we can't get at a store,

377
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,830
buddy, so yes, we got to steal them.

378
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,600
We'll get everything else and meet you there.

379
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,600
All right.

380
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,760
Look, um,

381
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,260
you gonna be okay?

382
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,060
Yeah. I just need time.

383
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,400
Right.

384
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,800
I'll be back as soon as I can.

385
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,930
Okay.

386
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,960
WHITE: I am so sorry

387
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,860
I'm not going to be around next week

388
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,200
to see you in action, Cole,

389
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,330
but you' be in good hands with Andy here.

390
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,660
I have got to catch a flight to San Francisco,

391
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,930
but I just wanted to say how thrilled we are

392
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,200
to have you here, and hopefully, some of the rest

393
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,500
of the sales force can learn a thing or two.

394
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,700
Uh, we'll settle up that check when I get back, all right?

395
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,400
Uh, remember, don't call it Frisco.

396
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,760
They hate that up there.

397
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,400
True.

398
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,100
Well, why don't I show you to your office, Cole?

399
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,860
-Okeydoke. -I'm sorry.

400
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,730
I didn't see anywhere in your paperwork

401
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,130
that you were... handicapped.

402
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,300
Otherwise, I would have made the necessary adjustments

403
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,860
to your work space.

404
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,100
Andy, I like to think of myself as...

405
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,430
handicapable.

406
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,830
Right. Yeah.

407
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,530
Well, here you are.

408
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,500
Right, right.

409
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,400
So this is where I'm gonna be doing my, uh...

410
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,460
my work, right here in this, uh...

411
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,530
...office.

412
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,130
That's right.

413
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,960
So, I'd better be rolling  my sleeves, then.

414
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,230
You know, Cole, I-I got to tell you.

415
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,730
I'm still a little amazed

416
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,230
at somebody I've never even seen at a convention

417
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,460
or seminar just falls from the sky

418
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,530
and shatters all of our sales records.

419
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,660
When you believe in GATE like I do,

420
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
it ain't that hard to sell.

421
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,860
There you go.

422
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,960
Well.

423
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,300
And here's your corner office as requested.

424
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,300
Welcome to the team.

425
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,630
All righty, then. Thank you.

426
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,260
One...

427
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,430
22...

428
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,330
...B.

429
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,430
Oh.

430
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,930
Hello, Sara.

431
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,460
ROLAND: Hey, Sara, where you going?

432
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,300
BARTENDER: What can I get you?

433
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,460
Club soda, please.

434
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,860
BARTENDER: How many years?

435
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,260
Sorry?

436
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,930
In the program. How many years

437
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,160
have you been sober?

438
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,960
About three years and three months.

439
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,900
Good for you.

440
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,560
Yeah, it doesn't feel good today.

441
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,700
But I'll take

442
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,660
the high five for cracking the big question.

443
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,800
Which is?

444
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,400
Is life a tragedy,

445
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,160
or is there...

446
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,130
...hope?

447
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,000
You tell me.

448
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,330
Double bourbon, neat.

449
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,860
pour it.

450
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,860
Cheers, honey.

451
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,730
We're good to go, guys.

452
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,000
Over here.

453
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,700
Eagles and Angels, with contributions from the Company.

454
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,300
This thing's supposed to start in five minutes.

455
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,100
Excuse me, sorry. No problem.

456
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,600
Where do you work out of?

457
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,000
That's one of my guys up there.

458
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,360
I'm sorry, I just...

459
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh, sure, sure.

460
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,660
Of course.

461
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,200
SARA: I've known him my whole life.

462
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,500
He was a very close person to my family.

463
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,860
It's always the good ones.

464
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,630
You ain't gonna drink that?

465
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,060
Honey

466
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,230
the Good Shepard is here to ease your pain.

467
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,160
Ronald Winston Shepard-- you can call me Shep.

468
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,730
Shep, I really don't feel like talking right now.

469
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,700
You've been talking to her.

470
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,460
Leave her alone, okay?

471
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,230
Pardon me.

472
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,630
BARTENDER: Go on.

473
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,030
When I was 13, I had to go see Annie, the musical,

474
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,960
but my mom had passed away

475
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,060
earlier that year and my dad had agreed to take me and...

476
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,160
I was all ready in my new drs,

477
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,100
and, uh, and I knew every word of this thing.

478
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,330
And my dad called from work,

479
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,330
and he said he wasn't going to make it.

480
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,860
That wasn't the first time.

481
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,760
And I remember feeling like I was floating...

482
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,900
like I was the only person in the whole world.

483
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,660
And Bruce came.

484
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,860
He showed up to take me and...

485
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,930
And after, he took me home, and he said

486
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,200
that if I ever needed him, he'd be there for me.

487
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,300
And a month ago, I needed him, and I called him.

488
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,930
And he died for it.

489
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,530
Just a sec.

490
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,560
What would he want you to do?

491
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,560
Let me do you a favor.

492
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,360
Uh, before we sit down to eat,

493
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,230
I'd like to welcome everyone

494
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,230
to the 15th Annual Eagles and Angels Benefit.

495
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,130
We all know why we're here tonight,

496
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,830
so I'd like to begin with a moment of silence

497
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,230
to renew our dedication to the law

498
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,900
and to honor those whose lives were cut short

499
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,760
by their fearless pursuit of justice.

500
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,130
They will truly be missed.

501
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,500
Thank you.

502
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,300
Enjoy your dinner.

503
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,030
I've been made, guys.

504
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,330
Just get the card copy.

505
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,660
Here we go.

506
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,060
We're copying

507
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,330
Hi, my condolences.

508
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,900
Yes?

509
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,360
The kip's at 15.

510
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,700
I understand.

511
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,160
I'm very sorry, but I'm going to have to leave.

512
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,430
Yeah. I'm so sorry. Yes.

513
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,800
What's she doing?

514
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,400
She's leaving.

515
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,730
I'm... so sorry.

516
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,230
Yeah?

517
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,200
I've been made. Meet me out back.

518
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,060
Go.

519
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,900
Lincoln Burrows.

520
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,630
I don't who you think i am.

521
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,700
I know who you are. Now put the gun slowy.

522
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,330
Three. Copy?

523
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,160
Three. Copy?

524
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,860
Move.

525
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,430
Move it.

526
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,030
Time to get the device.

527
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,430
That's far enough.

528
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,530
Why don't you just call one of the cops?

529
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,830
We work for the Company, Burrows. We don't need cops.

530
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,730
Got any last words?

531
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,500
Yeah?

532
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,530
We got a problem. I just killed one of the guards.

533
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,530
Let's go now!

534
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,930
No. We don't have it yet.

535
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,930
Do what you got to do.

536
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
We got to get rid of the body.

537
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,030
Let them find him.

538
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,900
What?

539
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,560
Wait for Mahone.

540
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,700
Gretchen.

541
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,460
How's my girl?

542
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,860
It seems your friend Whistler

543
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,430
wasn't the only one looking into Scylla.

544
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,830
You know anything about that?

545
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,500
No

546
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,200
No.

547
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,460
You never know anything, do you?

548
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,530
You have nothing to do with any of this.

549
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,700
Scofield, Burrows...

550
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,600
You don't know who...

551
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,900
No.

552
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:13,600
You can't keep lying to me.

553
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,330
No!

554
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,600
I don't know!

555
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,700
I don't know!

556
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,930
You look so...

557
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,230
...damn easy.

558
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,000
I can make this a lot harder.

559
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,960
Yes.

560
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,860
A credit card belonging to Bruce Bennett

561
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,060
was just used at a bar in San Pedro.

562
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,600
Thank you. It's lovely.

563
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,730
Excuse me.

564
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
Excuse me.

565
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,200
we have a DOA outside,

566
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,630
I believe it's one of your men.

567
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,260
You need to come with me.

568
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,930
Excuse me?

569
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,860
No one's leaving here until you make an ID.

570
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,560
Please.

571
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,400
Mathers.

572
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,500
Stay with Mrs. Tabak.

573
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,360
Uh, what hpened? I have a plane to catch.

574
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,160
I understand. We'll make this fast.

575
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,060
Officer Mathers, he'll wait with you.

576
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,860
Please. Stay with her.

577
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,500
If you could just wait with me, ma'am.

578
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,800
Thank you.

579
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,930
What's going on?

580
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,330
Should only take a few minutes.

581
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,300
This is a nice memorial.

582
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,960
I very much respect

583
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,360
the sacrifices you men make.

584
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,530
There's a lot of bad people out there.

585
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,330
Officer Mathers, you, um...

586
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,700
you have something.

587
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,760
Your, your nose is bleeding.

588
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,800
One day...

589
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,700
Excuse me.

590
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,860
I'm looking for this woman.

591
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,230
Here, take that.

592
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,630
You okay?

593
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,000
Hell, yes.

594
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,360
It's nothing. Travel safely.

595
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,260
Mrs. Tabak, we've got to leave.

596
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,860
Ma'am, now.

597
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,160
I'm telling you, I haven't seen her.

598
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,630
You're sure?

599
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,200
Oh, look out, fellas!

600
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,630
It's the pigs! Run!

601
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,560
Shut up, wiseass.

602
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,530
You're sure you got the whole thing?

603
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,960
A hundred percent.

604
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,060
Where's Sara?

605
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,230
It's not my turn to watch her.

606
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,860
What the hell are we gonna do? Someone must've seen us.

607
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,730
SELF: Don't worry, it's handled.

608
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,700
PAD  Politically motivated?

609
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,230
They think it had something to do with the Armenians.

610
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,800
Tip came in to LAPD.

611
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,830
The assailant thought the consul

612
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,930
was at the event.

613
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,230
Lisa's bodyguard got in the way.

614
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,000
Did Lisa make her flight?

615
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,760
Yes, General.

616
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,860
What do you got?

617
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,730
I had a guy.

618
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,960
I did. I had a guy.

619
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,200
He, uh, was an informant.

620
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,900
Actually, he used to work for the Company

621
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,460
for about 11 years until he

622
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,960
turned against them and decided to help me.

623
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,900
He said he had the location we needed.

624
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,060
But I, uh...

625
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,960
found him dead in his apartment today.

626
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,600
I'm sorry.

627
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,860
First Bennett, now your guy, huh?

628
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,200
They're closing in on us.

629
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,760
There's no doubt about it,

630
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
and now, I'm, uh...

631
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,500
empty-handed.

632
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,560
And now I have no idea where we need to break into.

633
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,830
We keep moving forward, ent Self.

634
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,430
Nothing changes.

635
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,160
No matter what. Right.

636
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,360
Okay .

637
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,500
Regardless of what happens, I, uh,

638
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,660
I like your style, Scofield.

639
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,230
You need anything else, Mr. Cole?

640
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,460
I'm all right, little lady.

641
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,000
What was your plan, Mr. Whistler?

642
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,530
What was your plan?

643
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,160
Cole Pfeiffer did not arrive for our meeting.

644
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,730
So you don't have Scylla?

645
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,600
Next time, Shan Xing.

646
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,900
I'll be in Los Angeles if anyone needs me.

647
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,330
Number two down, on to number three.

648
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,900
We manage to get anything off Lisa Tabak's phone?

649
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,200
I don't know.

650
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,430
I didn't pick up anything but the card.

651
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,360
I want to thank you

652
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,500
for what you did back there.

653
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,430
I need you to do something for me.

654
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah, doesn't everybody.

655
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,960
I'm looking for the man who killed my son.

656
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,060
What do you need?

657
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,460
Here's the police report.

658
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,700
I need you to get into the FBI database

659
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,900
and find a profile.

660
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,800
This man is a professional assassin.

661
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,800
He's African-American, six foot, four.

662
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,060
About 220 pounds.

663
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,660
That's for your eyes only.

664
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,700
Hey, are you all right?

665
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah, I think so.

666
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,260
Well, I was worried. Where are you?

667
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,300
Let me come get you.

668
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,500
No, it's okay. I'm almost home.

669
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,330
Um, listen...

670
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,200
You're what's keeping me going right now.

671
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,730
And you're all I have left, and that scares me.

672
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,930
I just want to be together.

673
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,800
I know the circumstances are a little less than ideal,

674
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,200
but we are together.

00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,360
You're here, I'm here.

676
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,630
It's not "one day" anymore, it's, um...

677
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,760
it's today.

678
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,230
Well, why don't you come back

679
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,230
and, uh, we'll make some dinner

680
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,360
and maybe find a little time for ourselves.

681
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,060
Okay, I'll be right there.
