1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,650
Previously on prison break.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,790
what do you want with scylla?

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,270
Same thing you want:
Bring down the company.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,330
We need the pages.

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,280
Are we partners?

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,590
Partners.

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,570
So your brother told me
about your nosebleeds.

8
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,050
I'm fine.

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,420
You don't look fine.

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,140
Sorry.

11
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,790
Consider this a warning.

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,500
linc,pull back!

13
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,180
It's a trap!

14
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,140
You all right?

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,580
Damn,you're hit!

16
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,640
All right,all right.

17
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,400
You'll get your shot,now back off!

18
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,100
This is an attempt on my card.

19
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,360
How do you want to proceed?

20
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,460
I want it moved.

21
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,090
Move scylla.

22
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,480
Now!

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,030
Now,tell the general you killed us.

24
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,760
Otherwise,my hand,it
ain't going to get tired.

25
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,730
I just hope your mouth gets tired.

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,440
That's funny.

27
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,870
Come on,buddy,come on.

28
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,120
Enough already,come on,linc.

29
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,930
Believe me now?

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,920
Beating him isn't going to work,lincoln.

31
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,680
You tried your way.

32
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,330
We want general krantz to
think wyatt took us out.

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,840
You don't think a trained military veteran
is going to hear the fear in his voice?

34
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,820
They're going to know he was coerced.

35
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:41,120
I hear you,linc,but he can't
make the call if he's unconscious.

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,250
However we do it,we better get
what we need from wyatt soon,

37
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:49,000
because mahone ain't going to wait.

38
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,030
I'm trying to find the son
of a bitch who killed my kid!

39
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,990
Lisa,what are we looking at?

40
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,740
Initial estimate is three days
to complete the move of scylla.

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,960
Unacceptable.

42
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,730
Respectfully,this is not as simple as unplugging
a laptop and moving it to another room.

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,550
The data on scylla is too delicate.

44
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,050
I don't want excuses.

45
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,660
All I care is that it's done
right and done right now.

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,620
I understand the urgency,but
it will take three days.

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,860
And if I may sak freely,

48
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,550
I think it's a mistake to move
scylla to the raven rock bunker

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,850
when the los angeles facility is
one of the most secure ones we have.

50
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,950
The most secure location we have
is the one they don't know about.

51
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,090
Sir.

52
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,110
still no word from wyatt.

53
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,570
He only uses the company-issued
cell,so we can't track him.

54
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,910
We have no way of confirming if he
successfully completed his operation.

55
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,020
Keep calling him!

56
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,630
And draft a press
release,photographs,criminal records,

57
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,140
everything we have on
scofield,burrows,all of them.

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,740
Tell our friends in
the media I want them

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,160
to saturate the evening
news and the morning papers.

60
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,060
I want it impossible for them to walk down the
streets of los angeles without being spotted.

61
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,000
I assume we haven't made much
progress with our friend overhere?

62
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,460
Any suggestions?

63
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,940
How about we talk to him?

64
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,500
Great,want to give him some milk
and cookies while you're at it?

65
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,320
No.How about just
some nice conversation?

66
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,130

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,930
So they sent florence nightingale
toet me all ready to cooperate.

70
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,890
Actually,I'm here to help
you,despite what you've done.

71
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,860
Because I'm still a doctor
and you're a prisoner.

72
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,160
You're going to save me?

73
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,110
Don self has a metal case out
there and I don't know what's in it.

74
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,060
I imagine you don't want to find
out,so I figure if you and I had a talk.

75
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,900
you'd make me see the light.

76
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,490
If you don't call the
general,you're as good as dead.

77
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,840
I've already been a lot of things
worse than dead in my life,doctor.

78
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,660
You better have more than
that to threaten me with.

79
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,650
Come on,mike,she's okay.

80
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,430
He's a professional killer.

81
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,620
Don't worry,he's locked up.

82
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,150
Let's go.

83
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,030
Come on,let's go!

84
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,980
So what'd you do with roland's body?

85
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,350
Roland?

86
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,020
He's been,uh,reconfigured and
given a permanent resting place.

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,940
Good.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,750
Take his bowling shirts and the rest
of his crap with you when you leave.

89
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,330
Come on linc,the guy died.

90
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,350
He died a punk!

91
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,560
He ratted us out,bellick.

92
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,720
You guys,you deal with
the matter at hand.

93
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,470
Assuming these pages are correct,

94
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,430
and there's no way of knowing
that they actually are.

95
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,430
we follow this basement hallway
through the boiler room to here.

96
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,180
There's some kind of elevated walkway.

97
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,950
We follow that to the end,

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,070
and we've covered most of the distance
between gate and the company's headquarters.

99
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,780
What's this thing at
the end of the walkway?

100
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,020
I don't know-- whistler
marked it with an "x"

101
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,760
so I'm thinking it's some kind
of wall or serious impediment.

102
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,470
That's why we're going
down there prepared.

103
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,850
Tools,thermal lances,sledgehammers.

104
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,760
okay,so we get through that wall.

105
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,390
what's on the other side?

106
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,730
Again,I don't know.

107
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,580
It's because gretchen
has the rest of the pages.

108
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,040
But once we're through this location,

109
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,330
we can't go any further
until she gives them back.

110
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,890
What's her game in all this?

111
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,140
I mean,if she wants
the company to go down,

112
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,380
she should just give us the pages.

113
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,870
Look,we're going to deal with
gretchen when the time is right,okay?

114
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,780
You guys need to go to
gate and get started.

115
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,230
I'm going to stay here with wyatt
and make sure we get what we need.

116
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,570
No more dawdlin' now.

117
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,410
Move your ass.

118
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,680
High gear,gentlemen,high gear.

119
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,860
My boss will be here any minute.

120
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,970
I assume I don't have to mention
that discretion is paramount.

121
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,240
In other words,silence is golden.

122
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,060
You just make sure you stay in your
office and you keep other people out.

123
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,940
Oh,I'll stay in my
nice,air-conditioned office,pretty.

124
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,160
And you can crawl down
into your little hole now.

125
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,600
Go ahead.

126
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,800
Go ahead,crawl.

127
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,820
Vamonos.

128
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,890
Cole?

129
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,420
What the hell is going on here?

130
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,060
Mr.White,are you back already?

131
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,900
How are you?

132
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,470
Fine,until I found a resignation fax
waiting for me from andrew blauner.

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,000
A resignation?

134
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,950
Yeah,I can't get him on the
phone,I reached out to his fiancée,

135
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,400
she hasn't seen or heard from him.

136
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,780
She's worried sick.

137
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,590
He's probably on a bit of a
bender,just sleeping it off somewhere.

138
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Blauner?

139
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,660
He's a boy scout.

140
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,110
None of this makes any sense,cole.

141
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,320
But I'll tell you what,I'm
going to look into it.

142
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,960
Let me know if I can
be of any assistance.

143
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,790
Good morning.Assistance.

144
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,650
What is that sound?

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,980
Yeah?

146
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,010
I hope you're having a
lovely enjoyable morning,

147
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,500
because while you are
nowhere to be found,

148
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,720
there is sleuthing going on here regarding
the whereabouts of one mr.Andrew blauner.

149
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,660
And?

150
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,740
And if I'm going down for this
little homicide,I ain't going alone.

151
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,820
We're going together
like traffic and weather.

152
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,020
Relax,okay?

153
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,540
They'll never find the
body where I put it.

154
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,290
Now,where are scofield and burrows?

155
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,090
Just doing their end of the bargain.

156
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,870
Which begs the question,what
the hell are you doing?

157
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,550
Me?

158
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,400
I'm getting ready for a meeting.

159
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,790
So,your friends have been calling a lot.

160
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,930
They must be wondering where you are.

161
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,510
That's right.

162
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,190
They're wondering,and the longer
they do,the more danger you're in.

163
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,590
Call the general,and say
what they want you to say.

164
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,750
And what?

165
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,720
You'll let me go?

166
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,050
No,but don self will make sure
that you spend the rest of your life

167
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,380
in a decent facility
without the death penalty.

168
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,410
Either way,if I make
the call or not,I'm dead.

169
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,950
You know that.

170
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:01,700
And we both know that you,as
a doctor,won't let that happen.

171
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:10,650
So,please,let's you and I figure a way
out of this mess that works for everybody.

172
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,590
Sit your ass down!Get out of my way!

173
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,880
Out!

174
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,140
I will cuff your ass to that table,okay?

175
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,870
All right,I know this is hard.

176
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,890
And I know what y want to do.

177
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,480
Okay,but I'm trying to do something here
and you need to deal with that reality.

178
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,640
Have you lost a kid?

179
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,570
Yeah,I did,too.

180
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,760
My wife was pregnant.

181
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,530
And there were complications
and the doctor messed up.

182
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,370
And she.

183
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,970
and they both.

184
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,970
they didn't make it.

185
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,070
Okay?So I understand.

186
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,300
What would you do if you were me
and that doctor was right there?

187
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,960
***What would you do?

188
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,160
I don't know what I would do.

189
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,650
Look,I'm giving you my word.

190
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,510
When the time is right,I
won't stand in your way.

191
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,490
When the time is right I won't let you.

192
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,820
- Okay.
- Okay.

193
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,850
Did you see the way mahone
was looking at wyatt?

194
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,980
The guy is hurting.

195
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,670
It was more than just
hurting,that's pain.

196
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,260
I never cared about anything like that.

197
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,950
I look at what I've done with my
life,beating on cons at fox river,

198
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,030
chasing money,trying to keep
my own ass out of prison.

199
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,140
This the pathway you talking about?

200
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,240
According to the map,this runs
almost the length of that courtyard.

201
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,570
It should put us directly
beneath company headquarters.

202
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,940
Shh,listen.

203
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,120
There it is again.

204
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,790
What's that noise,scofield?

205
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,200
I don't know.

206
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,350
Okay,just so we're clear,we get to go up

207
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,090
that ladder towards the noise
that we don't know what it is.

208
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,950
But if we're lucky,we get to basically
just walk smack into the company?

209
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,140
Sounds about right.

210
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,840
You up for it?

211
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,920
Oh,yeah,after you.

212
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,080
I am no different than
that man over there.

213
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,220
who wants to kill me.

214
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,010
Alexander mahone was forced to do
things by the company,and so was I.

215
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,540
But I know people.

216
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,340
People in government.

217
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,820
People that can help you and michael.

218
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,150
I can give you a phone number.

219
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,460
Arrangements can be made.

220
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:43,360
All you have to do is trust
me and this will all be over.

221
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,900
It is over.

222
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,520
Has,um,white had anything
new to say about blauner?

223
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,600
No,but he might.

224
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,360
Mr.Pfeiffer?

225
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,360
That would be moi.

226
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,710
Detective conor mara I was hoping I
could talk to you about andrew blauner.

227
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,010
Of course.

228
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,480
Great.

229
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,120
It's down this way.

230
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,850
This is it!

231
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,180
This is where the sound was coming from.

232
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,400
One of the main conduit
pipes for the la water supply.

233
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:43,260
30,000 gallons of water
rushing through th very spot.

234
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,790
Every second.

235
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,690
Oh,great.

236
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,440
There's got to be some other way to get
around it,some other pathway or something.

237
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,140
No,we took the only pathway
down and it leads right here.

238
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,270
How about over it?

239
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,140
We can't risk tunneling
too close to the surface.

240
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,160
What do we do?

241
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,070
We dig.

242
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,060
Truth be told,uh,mr.Blauner
isn't officially a missing person,

243
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,080
but his fiancée has a cousin at
the mayor's office so,here we are.

244
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,430
Here we are.

245
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,020
Hey,that's not to say though that there
aren't some things that concern me.

246
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,150
Really?Such as?

247
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,610
Well,the fax that came into white's office
anging continues came from a copy shop,

248
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,120
but blauner had a fax
machine at his house.

249
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,310
Okay.

250
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,940
And about a half hour after he resigned,

251
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,060
his car was seen
leaving the gate garage.

252
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,260
Now,the driver couldn't be identified,

253
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,010
but it appeared as though a woman's hands
were seen gripping the steering wheel.

254
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,190
Let me stop you right there.

255
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,540
It always seemed to me that mr.Blauner was,how
can I put this delicately,um,a swordsman.

256
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,980
You know what I mean?

257
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,160
Actually,I don'T.

258
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,820
He might be dipping his
snout into a different trough,

259
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,820
and the fiancée is none the wiser.

260
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,960
From what I've,uh,heard about
him from his other co-workers,

261
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,730
that doesn't sound too likely.

262
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,540
If you don't mind me asking,what
is that banging noise?

263
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,440
That's,uh.

264
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,280
it's trouble with the pipes.

265
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,840
You know,they loosened up,

266
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,690
it was a moderate quake and now they
shake more than the trembler itself.

267
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,940
Mr.Pfeiffer,uh,some people here have told
me that you and blauner didn't get along.

268
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,290
Would you mind talking to
me a little bit about that?

269
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,200
A few years ago,a partner of mine did
this same move agait an enemy combatant

270
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,740
we picked up at the
new mexico border--

271
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,000
this guy didn't want to
talk,he didn't know anything.

272
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,390
It worked then,

273
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,950
it should work now

274
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,310
- is that ambulance you got us still out back?
- Yeah.

275
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,420
Hey,come on,pal,

276
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,080
I got almost a decade on you
and you don't see me sucking air.

277
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,690
I got shot,brad.

278
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,550
Oh,yeah.

279
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,690
Guys,we ain't making any progress here.

280
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,820
There's nothing beneath
this cement but granite.

281
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,130
We couldn't get through
it with a jackhammer.

282
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,350
Maybe we should go back to
the warehouse,find another way.

283
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,230
There is no other way.

284
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,890
This is it!

285
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,380
This is where the plans lead;
this is our way to scylla.

286
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,470
What?

287
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,220
We got millions of gallons
of water in this drain pipe.

288
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,420
We can't go under
it,we can't go over it.

289
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,960
I know.

290
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,780
But maybe we can go through it.

291
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,820
it's loose!

292
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,720
All right,linc,this ought to do it.

293
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,620
After I'm done,how much time we got?

294
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,460
Not a lot.

295
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,990
Be careful.

296
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,700
You,too.

297
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,550
when I was a little boy,I
had an old tomcat named rufus.

298
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,940
He was a good mouser.

299
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,670
Tough as nails,solid feline all around.

300
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,480
One day,I bring home this little kitty
from a giveaway box outside the pic 'n save.

301
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,010
Old rufus didn't like that one bit.

302
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:29,770
He arched his back,hissed like a rattlesnake
and sprang out his claws like a switchblade.

303
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:37,200
You know,that new little kitty
didn't do nothing wrong but be new.

304
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,740
Now,that's all I did.

305
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,770
I was being new,and blauner was being
this old tomcat spraying his territory.

306
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,540
Now,I don't hold that against him.

307
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,550
If he didn't prote his turf
I'd question his character.

308
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,190
But aside from a little jealousy on his
part,our issues were as thin as tissues.

309
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,290
I assure you that.

310
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,470
detective,I pulled blauner's
travel schedule as per your request.

311
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,550
Thank you.

312
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,490
Uh,what's this?

313
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,480
Uh,sir,uh,we need to step out for a few
more bracket-joints for the shelving.

314
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,540
Uh,all right,yeah.

315
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,980
But I ain't paying you to stop for,uh,a
coffee and donuts,so get back here toot sweet.

316
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,920
Hey,wait up,manuel.

317
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,150
I hired some men,uh,out of
my own pocket of course,to,uh,

318
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,380
add some built-in uh,uh,storage in
my closet-- I hope you don't mind.

319
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,520
Nah.

320
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,560
Here's the monthly breakdown
of where he traveled.

321
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,280
you're gonna talk to me now?

322
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,280
Me?

323
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,300
No.

324
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,130
We're done talking.

325
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,120
but you're not.

326
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,710
wyatt's voice: They are all dead.

327
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,150
It's over.

328
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,190
wyatt's voice: This will all be over.

329
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,280
This will all be over.

330
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,920
It's over.

331
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,150
They are dea they are all dead.

332
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,690
It's over.

333
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,530
I'm going to take this.

334
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,540
Self.

335
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,450
can you take a walk?

336
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,410
Yeah.

337
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,260
come on,sara,we should go.

338
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,400
Let's go outside.

339
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,330
My son's autopsy report said that he'D.

340
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,970
that he'd been shot twice.

341
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,650
Once in the stomach.

342
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,860
why,man?

343
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,390
Why?

344
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,660
Just to terrify my wife?

345
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:28,360
and then a full five
minutes later,right in the.

346
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,310
you too will suffer.

347
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,810
And when.

348
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,870
and when you can't
stand the pain anymore,

349
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,820
you'll make a phone call for me.

350
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,390
You know,scofield said
that torture wouldn't work

351
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,360
because the general would
hear the fear in your voice.

352
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,650
But the thing is.

353
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,470
I want the person on the other end of
my call to hear the fear in your voice.

354
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,840
Press release,sir.

355
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,310
In short,it sets forth that
members of the fox river eight

356
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,260
and their accomplices are
alive and well in los angeles.

357
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,800
where have you been?

358
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,510
They are all dead.It's over.

359
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,980
Good work.

360
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,010
Your payment will be
left where we arranged.

361
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,010
This is no longer necessary.

362
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,330
go ahead.

363
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,490
The access code to the covert entrance
is still both your daughters' birthdays.

364
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,620
Everyone leave us alone.

365
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,570
I said everyone leave us alone.

366
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,390
It's okay.

367
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,140
She won't hurt me.

368
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,920
Lisa.

369
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,610
I knew you'd come home.

370
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,230
So,how are you holding up,you
know,not being with lj and all?

371
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,550
Good,he's a smart kid.

372
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,790
He can look after himself.

373
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,970
I can see it,how much you love him.

374
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,480
My dad died when I was a little kid.

375
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,660
But he was a good father.

376
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,690
Let's just focus and get
this thing done,all right?

377
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,640
Michael said the manual override should
be somewhere near the main conduit.

378
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,740
This look like the main conduit to you?

379
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,390
One way to find out.

380
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,510
That look like it to you?

381
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,490
- Looks like it.
- Fire it up.

382
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,440
All right,let's get out of here.

383
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,000
Hurry up,bro!

384
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,560
Almost done,buddy.

385
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,310
All right,ease it back.

386
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,220
it worked.

387
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,010
how long we got?

388
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,830
I don't know.

389
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,200
Water cut off to thousands of people.

390
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,900
The city will probably have that taken care
of in about an hour,which means we've got.

391
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,590
60 minutes to do 90
minutes worth of work.

392
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,500
Or we don't t to scylla.

393
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,800
What's wrong,papi?

394
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,450
Hey,mike.

395
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,920
Michael!Michael!

396
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,200
What's wrong,papi?Papi,talk to me!

397
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,450
What's wrong?Talk to me!

398
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,700
Michael!

399
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,770
Michael,what's wrong?

400
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,320
Michael!

401
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,530
You want some water?

402
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,600
I'm okay.

403
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,430
You're alot of things right now,my
friend,and okay ain't one of them.

404
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:28,490
You know,I may not be the
smartest guy,but I hear things.

405
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,760
Sara and your brother have been talking
about you not feeling well or something.

406
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,190
Look,I'm just,I'm just saying.

407
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,860
I need your help.

408
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,100
So,please,just,uh.

409
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,240
cover for me.

410
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,320
You got it.

411
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,400
Truth is,gretchen,I know you
better than you know yourself.

412
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,580
So you keep telling me.

413
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,920
When I first met you,you
were a 20 year old girl

414
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,010
who'd just been dumped by the wheeling police
academy for failing her psych evaluation.

415
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:31,680
But where those good old west virginia
boys could only see an emotional disconnect

416
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,670
with traces of sociopathic tendencies,

417
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:40,790
I saw a machiavellian streak that
would make failure an impossibility.

418
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,170
I had to let wyatt do what he
did because I needed to know.

419
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,680
What my little bulldog may have known
about whistler and his plans for scylla.

420
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,440
I told you that I knew nothing.

421
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,970
You should have believed me.

422
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,750
I knew you'd never take it personally,

423
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:10,320
because you are,and have been ever
since I took you under my wing.

424
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,820
My girl.

425
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,000
My girl.

426
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,290
The most sensitive nerve
endings are right here.

427
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,390
That's why acupuncturists avoid
placing needles anywhere near them

428
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,080
because opening up the nerve
endings in the fingertip--

429
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,930
even a little pinprick-- can
result in quit a painful hot flash.

430
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,690
So a five inch needle being
driven up the length of the finger.

431
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,920
can make your insides
feel like they're on fire.

432
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,060
Another fact of physiology,the human body
when in extreme duress begins to shut down.

433
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,280
Brain activity decreases
and your heart rate slows

434
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,520
until you just can't
feel the pain anymore.

435
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,620
And that's where the heart
monitor and the battery come in.

436
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,270
'Cause when your heart
rate dips below 50,

437
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,690
that battery will give
you a wake-up call,

438
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,590
preventing your body from shutting down.

439
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,100
And then you will feel every ounce.

440
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,830
of the pain.

441
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,240
and that's when you're going to
beg me to make the phone call.

442
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,310
What can I do you for?

443
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,610
I.I found some more inconsistencies
in your sales reports.

444
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,670
Listen up here.

445
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,510
From that little computer of yours,can
you access into gate's records?

446
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,930
If I access the network as an administrator,I
can see the files in a non-pdf format.

447
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,180
I don't know what that
means,but I assume it was a yes.

448
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,100
So you let your fingers do the walking across
that keyboard and you get me my sales records.

449
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,770
You are hurting my arm.

450
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,420
And don't make me hurt
any more of you.Now,go.

451
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,800
That's good work.

452
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,620
Here.

453
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,410
I need you to measure this hole.

454
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,430
And then make one of the same
size in the wall opposite.

455
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,030
How?

456
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,310
You got a belt?

457
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,840
We have less than 30 minutes until
this pipe is flooded with water again.

458
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,740
acceptance is important,wyatt.

459
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,560
I had to accept I had to
accept that my son is gone.

460
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,830
And you have to accept that your life,

461
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,670
your very,very short life-span ahead of you
is just ing to be filled with agonizing pain.

462
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,690
At least until you do
what I've asked of you.

463
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,210
And then.

464
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,290
then the pain will go away.

465
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,310
We're running out of time!

466
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,700
- Aw,man.
- What's wrong?

467
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,880
The stupid thing is empty!

468
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,590
All right.

469
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,520
I'm coming in.

470
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,640
You can't do this,bro.

471
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,940
Just finish it.

472
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,430
Hello?

473
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,330
It's me.

474
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,200
What's going on?

475
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,550
Somebody needs to tell you something.

476
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,770
You call her by her fit name.

477
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,730
Pam.

478
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,660
I'M...

479
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,800
sorry.

480
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,250
It's over.

481
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,630
And I love you.

482
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,900
I love you.

483
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,730
This thing is heavy!

484
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,360
Sure,show up when all
the hard work is done.

485
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,390
All right,ease it back.

486
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,230
We heard on the radio that dwp is going
to have the water running in 10 minutes.

487
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,520
You all right?

488
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,480
The sleeve is too heavy to
just slide it through the pipe.

489
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:09,750
Two of us are going to have to go inside
and guide it through that other hole.

490
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,570
That pipe can flood at any time.

491
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,640
I'll do it.

492
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,780
I'll go,too.

493
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,010
No,I'll go.

494
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,400
Oh,no offense,college
boy,but this sucker's heavy.

495
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,170
You're going to need a
little bulk down there.

496
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,620
All right.

497
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,670
Use this to brace the sleeve when
you pull it through to the other side.

498
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,520
And,uh.

499
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,130
let's get the hell
out of there,all right?

500
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,300
How's emmy?

501
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,930
I didn't come here to listen to
you pretend to care about her.

502
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,210
or me.

503
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,410
I came here to tell you
that I'm a free agent now.

504
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,760
The community we run with know
that I'm alive and available.

505
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,690
I can just as easily work for
one of them as I can for you.

506
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,270
So the question is,what's your offer?

507
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,960
Actually,the question for you is why
would you want to go anywhere else?

508
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,530
It's not a time for grudges,gretchen.

509
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,440
It's a time for coming together.

510
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,710
The salad days are fast approaching.

511
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,710
Laos worked perfectly.

512
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,450
Soon the populace
will turn to us--

513
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:30,100
the leaders of the military,finance
and energy-- to right the ship.

514
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,900
And then.

515
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,250
we'll rebuild this
country in our own image.

516
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:38,530
And when we do,I want you
there beside me,gretchen.

517
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,320
As my number two,like I always promised.

518
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,520
What about lisa?

519
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,200
I've already td yoU.

520
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,120
You're my girl.

521
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,190
Come on.

522
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,400
Over there.

523
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,330
Right up there.

524
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,530
You and I are the same,alex.

525
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,380
I've done things.

526
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,550
push!

527
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,400
Bellic keep going,keep going!

528
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,330
keep going!

529
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,960
Keep going!

530
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,340
Yeah,it's good right there.

531
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,920
- You got it?
- That's it.

532
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,080
I don't know how long
that's going to hold.

533
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,900
All we got to do is
pull this thing through.

534
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,770
Oh,my god.Come on,guys,push!

535
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,610
It broke!

536
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,990
The beam,it broke!

537
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,740
mr.White.

538
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,750
I'm sorry to bother you,but,uh,

539
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,540
after my talk with detective mara,

540
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,820
I was thinking about mr.Blauner and
some of the conversations we had.

541
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,790
Salesmen are a lot like fishermen,right?

542
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,860
Always bragging about their big catch.

543
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,400
well,andy never talked about his
sales,no matter how much I pried.

544
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,540
So I took the liberty of.

545
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,670
looking them up.

546
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,130
And there were,to say the least.

547
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,250
irregularities.

548
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,960
good afternoon to you,too,andy.

549
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,340
Two of your top buyers don't have
valid social security numbers.

550
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:22,430
I checked out the social security numbers of
the clients he allegedly sold gate workshops to.

551
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,580
In some cases the numbers
are just pure fabrications.

552
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,690
But the checks must've cleared.

553
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,760
He's must've been money laundering for god
only knows what kind of criminal exploits.

554
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,410
The point is.

555
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,190
if the good officer gets
his hands on these papers,

556
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,020
you know you're going to be up
to your eyeballs in irs auditors.

557
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:49,990
I suggest you go tell mr.Mara that you found
some irregularities in blauner's expenses.

558
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,820
Writing off personal matters,et cetera.

559
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:59,160
This will explain why he disappeared
and will placate the po-po.

560
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,720
Okay.

561
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,860
Listen,detective.

562
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,140
pick it up!Pick it up!

563
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,870
I can't,it's too heavy!

564
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,330
The brace must have snapped.

565
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,060
Let's try and get it up!

566
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,960
It's not moving!

567
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,730
The water's coming.

568
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,870
The water's coming!

569
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,150
Come on!

570
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,130
We got to leave it there.

571
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,850
But then we'll never get scylla.

572
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,550
We don't have a choice.

573
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,900
You don't,I do.

574
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,630
What the hell are you doing?

575
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,300
What the hell are you doing?

576
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,840
Brad,don't do this!

577
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,030
Brad!

578
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,690
Grab it,grab it,now!

579
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,660
The water's coming!

580
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,170
Get your ass up here,now!

581
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,500
Come on,come on!

582
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,490
You hear that?

583
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,230
They're flooding the pipe.

584
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,300
Linc!

585
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,580
Get out of there!

586
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,450
It's too loud,he can't hear you!

587
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,780
Linc!

588
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,560
Come on,man,there's still enough
room for you to get through the hole.

589
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,480
I let go othis you could drop it.

590
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,230
It's too heavy!

591
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,070
Brad,drop the sleeve
and get out of there!

592
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,000
Don't do this.

593
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,980
You have a son!

594
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,310
Don't do this.Don't do this!

595
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,690
Push it!

596
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,240
Push it,scofield!

597
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,650
Push!

598
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,520
Push it!

599
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,900
Push it!Push it!

600
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,900
Brad!

601
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,870
Brad,no!

602
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:58,500
Brad!Brad,no!Brad!Brad!

603
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,520
Brad,no!

604
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,900
Brad!

605
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,360
You can all come back in now.

606
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,860
Everything's fine.

607
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,260
It always was.

608
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,720
You're okay?

609
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,170
Couldn't be better.

610
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,050
More important: What's
happening with scylla?

611
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,420
I'll tell you in private.

612
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,860
You can tell me in front of gretchen.

613
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,430
Not until I say something else.

614
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,420
If you ever come near
him with a gun again.

615
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,290
you'll what?

616
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,280
That will do.

617
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,020
Scylla.

618
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,410
We got preliminary safeguards
in place faster than we expected.

619
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,810
We could move scylla
tomorrow if we wanted,

620
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:27,430
but now that wyatt's eliminated
scofield and burrows,there's no need.

621
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,050
Scofield and burrows are dead?

622
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,350
Dead as latin.

623
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,950
Go ahead with the plan.

624
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,790
If a couple of boys from illinois could
get that close,it's time to mix things up.

625
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:44,820
I want scylla out of los angeles
by the end of the day tomorrow.

626
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,150
He wouldn't climb up.

627
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,310
He just wouldn't climb up.

628
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,650
Whe does the south pipe lead to?

629
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,520
- Maybe we can follow.
- no.

630
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,020
No,he's gone.

631
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,650
