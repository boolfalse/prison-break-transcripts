1
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:08,511
 My name is Michael Scofield.
I am a fugitive.

2
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:14,151
Three weeks ago, I was incarcerated

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,751
in a Panamanian prison.

4
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:18,411
While I was there,

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,811
I was approached by the Company...

6
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:23,381
...a corrupt organization

7
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:27,911
involved in all levels of industry

8
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:29,711
They gave me two options:

9
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:32,651
break one of
their men--

10
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:35,051
James Whistler--
out of that prison...

11
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:39,451
or they would kill the
only woman I ever loved--

12
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,681
Dr. Sara Tancredi.

13
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:47,581
I held up my end and
broke Whistler out.

14
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,251
The Company...

15
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:53,751
...they killed Sara anyway.

16
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:59,651
I don't know why the
Company wanted James Whistler

17
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:03,611
out of prison, but I've
tracked him here to Los Angeles.

18
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:07,911
He's with an agent I
know only as Gretchen...

19
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,551
...the same agent who murdered Sara.

20
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:15,711
It ends today.

21
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,311
I will seek the justice

22
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:21,851
that I now know the
system cannot provide.

23
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:28,051
So if you're reading this letter,

24
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,781
you'll know I died
avenging Sara's death.

25
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:56,665
You get the data card.

26
00:01:56,695 --> 00:01:58,895
We drop it off in the racing
form, and we get the hell

27
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:00,065
out of there.

28
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:01,665
Who's the contact
we're leaving it for?

29
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:04,095
The Company wants
the card back, period.

30
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:05,295
All you need to worry about

31
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,395
is getting this rig the
hell out of there in a hurry.

32
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:08,665
Oh, I' be getting it out of there.

33
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,835
Don't you worry about that.

34
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:13,735
You worry about getting your
ass back in that seat in time.

35
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:19,635
If you pull this off, you
can come up to my room later

36
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:22,535
and the word "no" won't
be in my vocabulary.

37
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:25,695
Just make sure we get paid.

38
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,195
In and out.

39
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:47,035
Good to see you again.

40
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:49,235
You, too.

41
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:50,335
Didn't hear from you for a while.

42
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:51,335
Started to wonder if you
were still interested.

43
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,995
I am, very much so.

44
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:55,495
Well, I needed to
approach this carefully.

45
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,295
I'm sure you understand.

46
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:00,795
Who you buying it for?

47
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:02,135
A competitor?

48
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:03,995
A foreign country? Jason,

49
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,965
you know I can't get into that.

50
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:08,335
Now, we've bn negotiating
this for months.

51
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:09,495
I've jumped through all your hoops.

52
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:12,835
I've agreed to meet you here.

53
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:17,765
Do you want to sell
the card to me or not?

54
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:32,535
Be right back.

55
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:48,665
That's a lot of secrets on
a little piece of plastic.

56
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,065
Let me give you a
little bit of advice--

57
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:55,195
and this is
on the house--

58
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:57,595
watch your step with that thing.

59
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:00,095
The Company will do
anything to get it back.

60
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,535
Don't I know it.

61
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:32,965
What the hell are you doing? Yeah.

62
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:34,295
We got to get out of here.

63
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,835
I need to hide the gun.

64
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:38,365
Take the gun with you!

65
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:52,835
Where is she?

66
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:56,665
Michael, you don't understand.

67
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:59,695
Call Gretchen, get her in here now.

68
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,265
You have to trust me.

69
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,835
I'm not your enemy, Michael.

70
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:04,235
GRETCHEN: James.

71
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,395
We need to leave.

72
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,765
You know, despite everything...

73
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:11,835
if Sara could weigh in right now,

74
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:12,935
she'd tell me not to kill you.

75
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:13,995
That's the kind

76
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:15,465
of person she was.

77
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:17,795
That's the kind of
person you took from me.

78
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,935
James,

79
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:20,435
didn't you tell him?

80
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:21,735
He walked in five... Shut up!

81
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,065
Gretchen, look at me.

82
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:26,835
This is for Sara.

83
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:28,235
I never killed Sara.

84
00:06:28,265 --> 00:06:31,135
I wouldn't expect someone like
you to take this with dignity.

85
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:33,065
I swear to God she's alive.

86
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:35,935
Don't insult me and don't insult her.

87
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:37,395
She escaped.

88
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:39,835
We knew if you found out we
wouldn't have any leverage.

89
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:41,935
I fabricated the whole thing.

90
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:44,335
My brother saw... A head in a box!

91
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:45,965
From a cadaver.

92
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:47,635
You ask Lincoln what he really saw.

93
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:49,235
Listen to her, Michael.
Don't lie to me.

94
00:06:49,265 --> 00:06:50,765
I'm not lying to you.
Lincoln bought it,

95
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:53,665
you bought it, it worked.

96
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:56,665
Michael.

97
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:57,935
Then where is she?

98
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,465
I'll tell you when we get outside.

99
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:00,565
Right now,

100
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:02,595
we need to get out of here.

101
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:03,765
They found the bodies.

102
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,235
Give me the gun. She's lying.

103
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:09,395
Is she?

104
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:11,265
If you pull that trigger,
you'll never know.

105
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:13,195
Kill him, James.

106
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:14,265
Shut up.

107
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:15,495
Where is she?

108
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,035
Where is Sara?!

109
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:18,565
Michael,

110
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:20,695
if you don't give me that gun,

111
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:22,695
I'm going to shoot you in the head.

112
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:35,835
Let's go.

113
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:41,635
We got a double homicide
at the Roosevelt Hotel.

114
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:03,495
Sara

115
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:26,395
Do you know the difference

116
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:29,235
between a perfectly
executed operation

117
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:31,035
and a failed mission?

118
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:34,495
Sir? It's small unit leadership.

119
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:36,335
The Allies spent two and a half years

120
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:38,395
planning the invasion of Normandy,

121
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,335
but on D-Day it came
down to a handful of men

122
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:42,665
on a strip of beach

123
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:45,095
to decide the fate of the world.

124
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:47,235
What I'm getting at, Gretchen,

125
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,895
is even the best plan is only as good

126
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:52,765
as the moving parts on
the ground executing it.

127
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:55,035
General, we got your
card-- what's the problem?

128
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:56,865
We have nothing.

129
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:59,295
It's a duplicate.

130
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:00,695
Almost flawless,

131
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:02,035
but a duplicate.

132
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:03,035
That's impossible.

133
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:04,035
I saw... You know

134
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,835
how important the
retrieval of this card

135
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:07,595
is to me, Gretchen.

136
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:09,435
You know that this
is a security breach

137
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,735
that could have
catastrophic ramifications

138
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:13,665
for the Company.

139
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:15,895
The only thing I can think of...

140
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,195
there was a blind spot

141
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:19,235
when Whistler was hitting the target.

142
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:22,065
Maybe he made a duplicate
and he still has the original.

143
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,865
You hired him.

144
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,535
You kept him at the tip of the spear.

145
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:29,095
You insisted that we
get him out of Sona.

146
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,565
We had to.

147
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:32,665
He had already made
contact with the target.

148
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:34,795
At that point, it was
him or no one, sir.

149
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:38,395
What's your stake in all of this?

150
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:39,965
I had nothing to do with it.

151
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:41,335
Whistler acted on his own.

152
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:42,695
I swear to you.

153
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:46,395
General, I can fix this.

154
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:47,935
You trained me.

155
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:49,465
Not well enough, apparently.

156
00:09:58,295 --> 00:09:59,365
Please.

157
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:01,365
I have a bank account in Dubai

158
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,235
left over from a slush
fund from COBRA II.

159
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:04,295
It's yours.

160
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:05,465
No, please, please...

161
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:14,835
Hello.

162
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,095
Hey, it's me.

163
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:18,365
Where are you, man?

164
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:19,535
Los Angeles.

165
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:20,535
You okay, Michael?

166
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:23,135
No, I'm, I'm safe.

167
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,965
Thank God, thank God.

168
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:26,495
How's LJ

169
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:28,065
and Sofia? Yeah, they're, um...

170
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,895
I'm staring at them
right now in fact.

171
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:32,595
They're fine.

172
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:33,835
You hear about Sona?

173
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:34,795
What about it?

174
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:35,865
Burned down three days back.

175
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:37,395
The inmates--
they rioted.

176
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:38,895
Bellick

177
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:40,565
T-Bag, or Sucre.

178
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:41,865
Sucre

179
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:43,265
He got popped--
I don't know how.

180
00:10:43,295 --> 00:10:44,965
I mean, the papers listed
the names of the inmates,

181
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:47,365
and he was in there
when it went down.

182
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:50,535
I found Whistler and Gretchen...

183
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:52,735
and, uh...

184
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:56,465
...Gretchen said...

185
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:00,635
...she said Sara is still alive.

186
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:05,395
What did you see, Linc?

187
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:07,195
What do you mean what
did I see, Michael?

188
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:09,465
I need you to tell me
exactly what you saw.

189
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:10,795
Michael, Sara's gone.

190
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:11,835
Well, you said

191
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:13,765
it was in a garage,
right? So it was dark.

192
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,895
Yeah, it was dark.

193
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:20,135
But if you're asking me
if I picked up the head

194
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:23,695
to check to see if it was
Sara, no, Michael, I-I...

195
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:27,095
LJ said he...

196
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:28,865
he only heard them kill Sara, right?

197
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,035
You just got to come back, please.

198
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,695
Come back. Let's just...

199
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,265
let's just start a new life.

200
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,695
Tell Sofia I said hi.

201
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:38,495
And tell LJ...

202
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:40,495
tell him his uncle loves him.

203
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:42,665
Michael, don't do this, please.

204
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:06,035
Out, out!

205
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:08,465
You need some better
ventilation back there, amigo.

206
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:09,765
ue?

207
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,735
Want to translate that?

208
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:11,695
Don't worry about it.

209
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:12,865
Gracias.

210
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,435
Where's your mom?

211
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:18,365
She'll be here.

212
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:19,565
What do you mean she'll be here?

213
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:20,665
We're-we're running out of time.

214
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:22,265
-I got to be up there.
- Don't worry.

215
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:23,635
My mom wouldn't let me down.

216
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:27,535
At least, she hasn't yet.

217
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:29,765
Bradley

218
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:30,995
Over here!

219
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:32,465
Mom! Mom! Here!

220
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:34,795
I told you! Don't worry,
you'll make it there!

221
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:37,395
Ah!

222
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:39,235
Oh! Oh!

223
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:46,795
What is it called?

224
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,835
EuropeanGoldfinch.net

225
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:51,335
It's what we can all
use to communicate.

226
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:21,065
Michael

227
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:30,665
Don't worry, I'm alone.

228
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:31,795
It's good to see you.

229
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:33,435
So where's your new best friend?

230
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:35,495
Well...

231
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:36,635
I don't know about that,

232
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:38,735
but Whistler's not
who you think he is.

233
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:40,895
We're working together

234
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:42,235
against the Company.

235
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:44,235
-Yeah?
- Yeah.

236
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:45,735
And what about Gretchen?

237
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:46,735
She working with you?

238
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:49,765
He needed her to further his plan.

239
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,895
Look, if the guy was Company,
he'd have shot you dead

240
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:53,665
back at that conference
like she wanted him to.

241
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:57,435
Do you have any information
about Sara or not?

242
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:01,135
Let's go somewhere a
little more private.

243
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,495
I want you to tell me right now.

244
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:04,565
I want you to tell me
right now, right here!

245
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,065
Or we can get Gretchen on the phone.

246
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,635
Gretchen's dead.

247
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,235
She never showed up.

248
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,535
Come and talk to me, please.

249
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:20,935
Whistler and I were at that
conference to get a data card.

250
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:22,635
It's like the Company's black book.

251
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:25,935
And it lists all their
agents, all their operations.

252
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,765
They refer to it as

253
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:29,435
"Scylla."

254
00:14:29,465 --> 00:14:30,735
Whistler's got it.

255
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:32,395
Alex, talk to me about Sara.

256
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:33,495
That's all I care about.

257
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:34,765
I understand that.
I want nothing more

258
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:36,765
than to get home to
my wife and my son.

259
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:39,665
But that's not gonna
happen for either of us

260
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,265
with the Company out
there trying to kill us.

261
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:43,195
You don't know anything
about Sara, do you?

262
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:44,165
Whistler does.

263
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:45,265
He tells me he does.

264
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:47,795
And he wants to tell you.

265
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:49,195
But he wants something in return.

266
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:51,335
What? What does he want from me?

267
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:52,595
To talk to you.

268
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:06,065
I'm sorry about all
that the other night.

269
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:08,165
If I had more time, I would've
explained myself better.

270
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:09,395
Sure.

271
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:10,435
What are we doing here?

272
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:12,495
Alex told you about Scylla? Yes.

273
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:14,265
I have it.

274
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:16,795
There's one last step involved
in order to read the data.

275
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:18,965
And that step involves breaking
into a secured structure.

276
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:21,065
So now you need my help.

277
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:22,265
Yeah.

278
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:24,035
My book, the bird
book, the one I lost

279
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:25,195
in Sona contained information

280
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:27,095
that would've helped
facilitate the break-in,

281
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,665
but it can still be accomplished,

282
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:29,835
with your help.

283
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:31,235
Where's Sara?

284
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:35,495
The only thing I know for sure,

285
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,635
a week ago, some information

286
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:39,435
came through the wire.

287
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:41,565
Sara may have bought a
bus ticket in Santa Fe.

288
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:42,795
Headed where?

289
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:43,935
Chicago.

290
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:45,165
Michael, if Sara's

291
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,765
out there, she's not
safe-- none of us are.

292
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:48,965
The Company knows we still have

293
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:50,295
the original card, and that's why

294
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:52,135
Gretchen was the first to go.

295
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:53,995
I think we're done here.

296
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:57,465
Michael,We... have a chance for once

297
00:15:57,495 --> 00:16:00,135
to get Scylla to people that
want to take the Company down.

298
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:03,765
I don't want to run anymore.
We won't have to run anymore.

299
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:06,765
I spent the last month
thinking Sara was dead

300
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:08,465
and that it was my fault.

301
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:10,695
If she's out there,
I'm gonna find her.

302
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:11,665
That's all I care about.

303
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:13,165
This can be done within a week.

304
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:14,865
Less.

305
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:16,235
At least let me show you...

306
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:56,291
Oh, I'm gonna miss

307
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:58,761
these gams, girl.

308
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,891
Don't go.

309
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:03,421
This ain't no home for
a white boy from Alabama.

310
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:06,721
They're here, seur.

311
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:08,391
The bags are packed.

312
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:24,821
You kept your word to me.

313
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:26,821
You're the first that's
ever done that. Gracias.

314
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:31,721
Why must you go after this man?

315
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,721
You could choose not to.

316
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,891
Where I come from, there's
something called a blood feud.

317
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:38,591
Comprende?

318
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:39,791
Yes.

319
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:41,361
Michael Scofield left me for dead

320
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:44,921
one too many times, as it turns out.

321
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:47,291
What is Spanish for "little angel"?

322
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:48,491
Angelita.

323
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:54,191
Adios,angelita.

324
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:04,261
Is this legit?

325
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,791
Oh, S¨ª seur

326
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:09,521
For the money you're paying,
first class, all the way.

327
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:11,261
So these are coyotes one could trust.

328
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,221
Oh, S¨ª seur.

329
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:15,661
Vamanos.

330
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:40,561
As you've seen,

331
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:44,491
what you're entering
into is quite serious.

332
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:46,121
I realize that.

333
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:48,591
You're responsible for this now.

334
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:50,961
You have nothing to worry about.

335
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:53,561
We'll talk soon.

336
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:00,191
It's time to clean up now.

337
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,291
Thoroughly.

338
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:04,491
Everyone who was close to Whistler:

339
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:07,091
Scofield,

340
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:09,291
Mahone, Burrows.

341
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:11,821
Burrows is still in Panama.

342
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:14,061
Clean up.

343
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:26,491
Hello.

344
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:28,461
Hi, Pam.

345
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:32,121
Where...

346
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:33,361
Where are you?

347
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:34,561
Uh, you know.

348
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:38,161
In the middle of it, as usual.

349
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,391
Panama still?

350
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:40,391
No.

351
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:41,961
No.

352
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:43,661
Are you okay?

353
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:45,591
Definitely.

354
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,461
Are you?

355
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:50,321
Yes.

356
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:53,021
And Cameron?

357
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,761
He's fine.

358
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,261
I have to tell you, Pam, you know,

359
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:01,291
I had a plan for all
of us to be together.

360
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:04,291
And...

361
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:07,661
I'm not gonna stop working on it.

362
00:20:07,691 --> 00:20:11,721
Why do you need a plan if
you want to be with someone?

363
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:14,521
You just be with them.

364
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:19,261
Don't say that unless you mean it.

365
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,691
'Cause I'll turn this world
upside down to get back to you.

366
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,491
So don't say it unless you mean it.

367
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:28,961
I mean it.

368
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,891
Okay.

369
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:34,364
Come on, babe.

370
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:36,264
I-I hate plantains, you know that.

371
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:38,334
I try your chili burger.

372
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:40,534
Chili-chili burger? You
loved the chili burger.

373
00:20:40,564 --> 00:20:41,634
Okay, I'm gonna

374
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:43,434
make them with my
mom's special recipe.

375
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:44,464
Your mom's special recipe?

376
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:45,404
You'll love it.

377
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:46,404
Really?

378
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:48,804
Yeah! You're gonna love it.

379
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:51,764
It's delicious.

380
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:56,164
Let's get out of here. Drop 'em.

381
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:58,264
Let's go. Give me your hand. LJ.

382
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:02,104
Yeah, come with me.

383
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:03,804
Lincoln, what's going on?

384
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:07,364
Dad.

385
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:08,404
We're safe now.

386
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,204
Relax. No.

387
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:11,204
I saw someone.

388
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:12,834
Looks like Company, I'm sure of it.

389
00:21:12,864 --> 00:21:15,334
Let's just go, okay?

390
00:21:15,364 --> 00:21:16,604
Let's go.

391
00:21:18,504 --> 00:21:20,534
We'll-we'll be fine.

392
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:21,664
All right, all right. Yeah.

393
00:21:21,704 --> 00:21:22,734
Okay.

394
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:24,134
Let's go.

395
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:29,204
Get back.

396
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:43,864
Dad!

397
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,434
Dad, we have to run.

398
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,464
Go. Get out of here.

399
00:21:57,504 --> 00:21:58,564
Run!

400
00:21:58,604 --> 00:21:59,734
Get going!

401
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:01,034
Lincoln!

402
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:02,504
Lincoln!

403
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:22,634
I'm looking for Alex.

404
00:22:22,664 --> 00:22:24,934
I don't know where he is.

405
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:28,134
No?

406
00:22:28,164 --> 00:22:29,464
No.

407
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:31,404
Uh, we've been divorced
for almost two years now.

408
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,264
We haven't had contact in months.

409
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:37,364
I would think that might change
now that he's back in the U.S.

410
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:41,504
I am so sick of you people--
what are you a fed?--

411
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:43,334
thinking that you can
keep on harassing...

412
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:46,834
I'm not with the government, Pam.

413
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:48,764
Mom, could you come here?

414
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,204
We're done talking...

415
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:35,134
Bruce Bennett.

416
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,564
Do you know who this is?

417
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,404
I do.

418
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:43,564
I'm looking for Sara, and right now,

419
00:23:43,604 --> 00:23:47,134
you're the only person I
can think of who can help me.

420
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:49,264
Hold on.

421
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,304
Where are you?

422
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:01,634
Back in Chicago.

423
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:02,704
Have you heard from her?

424
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,004
Meet me in front of the
Drake Hotel in a half hour.

425
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:08,304
Please just tell me... is she alive?

426
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:12,464
Are you Michael Scofield?

427
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:18,264
Are you Michael Scofield?

428
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,004
Yes, I am.

429
00:24:36,264 --> 00:24:37,734
Michael Scofield.

430
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:42,004
Special Agent Don
Self, Homeland Security.

431
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:44,564
Were youhere when James
Whistler was killed?

432
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:46,164
I didn't kill him.

433
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:47,734
I know you didn't.

434
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:51,364
He was an independent contractor

435
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:55,064
who worked for the Company
for about ten years.

436
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:58,364
He was assigned to retrieve
Scylla once it went missing.

437
00:25:00,104 --> 00:25:02,664
Do you know what Scylla is?

438
00:25:02,704 --> 00:25:05,034
It's the Company's little black book.

439
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:08,134
So he was going to make a
copy of it and give it to me.

440
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:09,334
What do you want from me?

441
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:12,104
You're looking at major time.

442
00:25:12,134 --> 00:25:13,664
You know that, right?

443
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:17,804
So how would you like to
walk away from it all...

444
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:20,404
not do a day?

445
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:24,364
In exchange for...? Scylla.

446
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:28,634
All right. Sara Tancredi,
last seen in Panama,

447
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:30,764
if you help me find her,

448
00:25:30,804 --> 00:25:32,004
maybe we've got a deal.

449
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:34,204
I'm sorry, she's not my
department, Scylla is.

450
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:35,604
Then go find it yourself.

451
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,204
It seems to me,

452
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:38,704
the U.S. government should
have a little more reach

453
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:40,804
than someone who's
looking at major time.

454
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,834
To perform the operation, Michael,

455
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:44,864
that would require signatures

456
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:46,934
from about 20 different
department heads.

457
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:49,364
Do you want to bet at least
one of them is Company?

458
00:25:49,404 --> 00:25:51,204
The only way this is going to work

459
00:25:51,234 --> 00:25:54,004
is via freelancer, off the books.

460
00:25:54,034 --> 00:25:55,664
It sounds complicated.

461
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:57,304
I'll take a pass.

462
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:59,964
I'm giving you an opportunity
to avoid 15 years in jail,

463
00:26:00,004 --> 00:26:02,764
not to mention the time
that your brother's facing.

464
00:26:02,804 --> 00:26:04,364
What are you talking about?

465
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:06,504
The Company tried to
take him out in Panama.

466
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:09,464
He, um... reacted,

467
00:26:09,504 --> 00:26:11,504
apparently.

468
00:26:11,534 --> 00:26:12,964
But I just made a deal

469
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,364
with the Panamanian authorities

470
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:16,464
for him to serve out
his time in the U.S.

471
00:26:16,504 --> 00:26:18,464
He should be touching
ground any time now.

472
00:26:24,264 --> 00:26:26,334
You recognize this handwriting?

473
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:29,204
This is your father's.

474
00:26:29,234 --> 00:26:30,764
He spent the last two years

475
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:34,364
of his life going
after this very thing.

476
00:26:40,504 --> 00:26:43,064
Do you believe in fate, Michael?

477
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:46,734
I think I'd like to
talk to my brother.

478
00:26:51,804 --> 00:26:54,304
Oh, no.

479
00:26:58,564 --> 00:27:00,634
Oh, no.

480
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:07,504
What's going...?

481
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:09,964
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa!

482
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:13,704
Stop! Stop! Hey! You
don't want to go in there.

483
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:16,104
You don't want to go in there.

484
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,764
God, she's...

485
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:51,664
Lilah Maria Sucre.

486
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:55,134
She gave her my name?

487
00:27:56,364 --> 00:27:59,304
Soy tu papa.

488
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:11,264
You're setting me up?

489
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:14,834
Sucre, you can't keep
bringing Maricruz down.

490
00:28:14,864 --> 00:28:17,904
You can't do this to her anymore.

491
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,904
Wait. Don't...

492
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,604
Sucre, don't...

493
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:26,004
Go! Go!

494
00:28:26,034 --> 00:28:27,434
Oh, boy.

495
00:28:36,264 --> 00:28:39,664
We're screwed.

496
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,934
You know why Scofield

497
00:28:43,964 --> 00:28:45,834
gets all twisted up
when he's around me?

498
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:49,364
We're the same, and
he just can't stand it.

499
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:51,504
Drives his ass crazy.

500
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:53,104
We got the same brilliant mind,

501
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:55,964
the same natural-born
leader tendency,

502
00:28:56,004 --> 00:28:59,204
the same one-in-a-million-type
charisma, yes?

503
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:02,134
He just gonna look
down his nose at me?

504
00:29:02,164 --> 00:29:04,234
How you gonna find him?

505
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:07,534
This.

506
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:09,234
You're both into birds?

507
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:09,234
You're both into birds?

508
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:10,664
No, no.

509
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:10,664
No, no.

510
00:29:10,704 --> 00:29:14,034
It's either gonna take
me to him, or he to me.

511
00:29:10,704 --> 00:29:14,034
It's either gonna take
me to him, or he to me.

512
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:15,934
I just know it.

513
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:15,934
I just know it.

514
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,104
If I was you, I'd forget
about this Scofield.

515
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,104
If I was you, I'd forget
about this Scofield.

516
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:19,964
You have plenty of
money. See? I mean...

517
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:19,964
You have plenty of
money. See? I mean...

518
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:22,064
how much money you have in that bag?

519
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:22,064
how much money you have in that bag?

520
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:24,464
Why don't you just mind
your own beeswax, huh?

521
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:24,464
Why don't you just mind
your own beeswax, huh?

522
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,864
You just keep pointing

523
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,864
You just keep pointing

524
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,264
this jalopy northbound, all right?

525
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,264
this jalopy northbound, all right?

526
00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:31,134
Get me back to the land 'o cotton.

527
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:32,664
Of course.

528
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,834
Ready.

529
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:58,604
Only a few people in government
will know of the operation.

530
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:00,064
It has to stay that way,

531
00:30:00,104 --> 00:30:02,834
or people's lives will be
in danger, mine included.

532
00:30:02,864 --> 00:30:04,334
Taking down the Company
sounds a little bigger

533
00:30:04,364 --> 00:30:06,264
than a two-man job, no?

534
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,534
I'm going to get you help.

535
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:08,564
I thought you said, you
couldn't trust anybody.

536
00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:09,604
Yeah, but maybe you can.

537
00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:11,404
All right, two
of your cohorts--

538
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:15,004
Fernando Sucre, and Brad
Bellick were arrested,

539
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:16,464
they're both facing time,

540
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:19,034
and Alexander Mahone is
in a Colorado jail cell.

541
00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:21,304
Good, let him sit there.

542
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:23,004
You're going to need Mahone if
you want to make this happen.

543
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:24,704
He was working with Whistler.

544
00:30:24,734 --> 00:30:26,304
And you'll have me.

545
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:28,864
Okay? Whatever you
need, I'll provide.

546
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:30,964
Whistler also said something
about a second step,

547
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:32,864
something about a break-in.

548
00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:35,264
Yeah, the card has
all the data on it,

549
00:30:35,304 --> 00:30:36,904
but it's encrypted.

550
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:38,234
Once you get your hands on it,

551
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:39,564
you're going to need
to find a way to break

552
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,064
into the Company's headquarters.

553
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:42,734
It's the only way to
unlock what's on the card.

554
00:30:42,764 --> 00:30:43,734
Where's the building?

555
00:30:43,764 --> 00:30:45,334
L.A. Where in L.A.?

556
00:30:45,364 --> 00:30:46,664
I don't know.

557
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:49,004
So, we've got a data card,
which could be anywhere,

558
00:30:49,034 --> 00:30:50,404
and we've got to
break into a building,

559
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:52,434
the location of which
has yet to be determined.

560
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:54,004
Simple enough.

561
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:55,334
You've broken out of
two penitentiaries.

562
00:30:55,364 --> 00:30:58,134
I'm thinking, uh,
breaking into a building

563
00:30:58,164 --> 00:31:00,504
isn't too far outside
your wheelhouse.

564
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:01,904
How do you know our dad?

565
00:31:01,934 --> 00:31:06,064
He heard from contacts
that I could be trusted.

566
00:31:06,104 --> 00:31:07,634
Your father was a good man.

567
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:09,204
Why now?

568
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,334
Look, I've been going after
the Company for five years.

569
00:31:11,364 --> 00:31:13,064
Okay? When Whistler
was killed yesterday,

570
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:16,604
the plug was going to be
pulled on the entire operation.

571
00:31:16,634 --> 00:31:18,704
But, uh...

572
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:21,234
I convinced my superiors
to give it one more chance.

573
00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:23,504
So this is like job security for you?

574
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:24,504
What's that?

575
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:26,434
Well, when we go out
there and risk our necks,

576
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,064
you can collect your pension.

577
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:29,534
No, no, no, Lincoln.

578
00:31:29,564 --> 00:31:31,304
Okay, some people still
care about their job.

579
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:33,264
Some people still
fight for th country.

580
00:31:33,304 --> 00:31:35,164
Maybe you've been a
little too distracted

581
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:36,464
boosting car stereos
and breaking heads

582
00:31:36,504 --> 00:31:37,964
to remember that.

583
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:49,434
If we do this deal,

584
00:31:49,464 --> 00:31:51,864
after it's done,

585
00:31:51,904 --> 00:31:55,564
you can look for
Sara... if she's alive.

586
00:31:55,604 --> 00:31:57,734
If we take this deal,
we'll both be dead

587
00:31:57,764 --> 00:32:00,164
long before I get the chance, Linc.

588
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:09,634
You guys must have
some big-time friends.

589
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:10,964
What are you talking about?

590
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:12,364
Somebody just posted

591
00:32:12,404 --> 00:32:14,304
a significant amount
of bail for both of you.

592
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:15,404
Who?

593
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,164
I don't know, but they're outside.

594
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:19,264
You're free to go.

595
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:22,934
Here, take your dad's
file. My number's inside.

596
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:24,864
We ain't doing this.
Just take it anyway.

597
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:27,064
This file, it means
nothing to me anymore.

598
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:45,864
Bruce Bennett.

599
00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:52,004
Let's go for a drive.

600
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:06,704
I thought I'd never see you again.

601
00:34:31,064 --> 00:34:33,134
I have something for you.

602
00:34:37,504 --> 00:34:39,664
Okay.

603
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:46,604
You left this behind.

604
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:52,204
Is that what this is about?

605
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:54,434
You just getting me my rose back?

606
00:34:54,464 --> 00:34:56,064
Yeah. I guess I'm done now.

607
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:57,264
I can retire.

608
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:03,334
How much time are you looking at?

609
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,804
They're saying 15 years.

610
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:11,864
I have to find out for sure.

611
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:15,804
I heard Lincoln say
something about a deal.

612
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:17,304
No jail time.

613
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:21,004
In exchange for taking
down the Company.

614
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:23,134
How?

615
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,234
Exactly.

616
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:32,664
I love you.

617
00:35:32,704 --> 00:35:35,164
That's all I know right now.

618
00:35:54,464 --> 00:35:57,834
"Will you not yield
to the immortal gods?"

619
00:35:58,804 --> 00:36:00,234
"That nightmare cannot die.

620
00:36:00,264 --> 00:36:01,904
"Eternal evil itself.

621
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:04,604
"There is no fighting her, no.

622
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:07,334
No power that can fight her."

623
00:36:07,364 --> 00:36:10,404
Now, listen to me--
it's up to you now.

624
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:26,534
"All that avails is flight."

625
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,160
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

626
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,330
I'm sorry.

627
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,160
Do you want to talk about it?

628
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,630
It's not your fault.

629
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,160
It's not.

630
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,300
Tell me what happened.

631
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,030
It's just the Company.

632
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,460
It's just what they do.

633
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,130
It wasn't just me.

634
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,460
God, it was you and LJ and-and

635
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,300
Lincoln.

636
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,030
And they won't stop,

637
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,400
and I don't know how
to deal with that.

638
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,830
Hey, come here.

639
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,660
Come here. Come here.

640
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,360
Let's go!

641
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,930
Are you okay?

642
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,100
I can't believe they
found us so fast.

643
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,930
Should I call... should I call Bruce

644
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,500
and-and get some place safe?

645
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,400
No place is safe.

646
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,500
They're not gonna stop
unless we stop them. Linc?

647
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,130
You are thinking what I'm
thinking? Let's end this.

648
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,230
But I'm not gonna
leave you behind again.

649
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,930
Yeah?

650
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,700
We're in.

651
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,730
Hey, papi.

652
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,230
Linc.

653
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,330
I can't tell you how grateful
I am for you including me.

654
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,960
Well, Sucre vouched for you, Bellick.

655
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,530
He said you came through

656
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,730
for him down in Panama.

657
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,130
Alex?

658
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,230
Michael.

659
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,000
You ready for this?

660
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,030
Yeah. I am.

661
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,100
So I hear Whistler's bird book

662
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,160
has details about
what we need to steal.

663
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,730
Yeah.

664
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,260
You know who's got it, right?

665
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,900
Please.

666
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,400
We'll die out here.

667
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,430
Thanks for the cashgringo.

668
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,660
First class all the way.

669
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,360
Do we have any idea where T-Bag is?

670
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,300
That snake could be anywhere.

671
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,630
When we're in L.A., we
can think like convicts,

672
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,930
we just can't act like them.

673
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,900
If we do, we're done.

674
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:47,930
It goes
without saying--

675
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,230
this is your last chance to back out,

676
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,560
'cause first on the list of things

677
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,960
I cannot guarantee
you is your safety.

678
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,060
We're all a long way

679
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,330
from where this started.

680
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,530
But what I can guarantee you

681
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,460
is that if we do this thing right,

682
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,260
we'll be close to where it ends.

683
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,600
Freedom.

684
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,760
Finally.

685
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,560
You two--
let's go.

686
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,760
Hey, Mike?

687
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,160
What about Sara?

688
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,760
Sara's in.

689
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,600
All right, we're
heading out tomorrow.

690
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,060
I have to finalize a
few things before we go.

691
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,100
No games and no stunts.

692
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,430
Otherwise, I promise,

693
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,560
you're gonna see a whole
different side of me.

694
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,660
Likewise.

695
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,200
Fake IDs.

696
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,800
It's a good start,

697
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,900
but there are some
things you can't fake,

698
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,460
and there are some things

699
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,660
you can'de.

700
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,600
Know what I mean?

701
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,530
How high is your threshold for pain?

702
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,400
You sure you don't want a sedative?

703
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,130
We're gonna go into the night.

704
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,160
How do you feel?

705
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,660
Lighter somehow.

706
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,260
Look, I don't know how
we're gonna take them down.

707
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,130
I don't even know who they are,

708
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,330
but I do know
one thing--

709
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,430
the Company's gonna pay
for what they did to you.

710
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,130
SELF: Let's go.

711
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,800
You sure you're up for this?

712
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,460
If we can

713
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,500
do it together, um... yeah.

714
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,230
Absolutely.

715
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,900
A C-130? What do they want...

716
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,060
want us to parachute
out of this thing?

717
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,660
This guy called in a
favor to the Air Force.

718
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,900
It's not like we can be
flying commercial, you know?

719
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,660
If you're successful
with obtaining Scylla,

720
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,760
you'll not only avoid jail time,
but you can take great pride

721
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,500
in knowing you helped dismantle
this country's greatest threat

722
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,360
to its own democracy.

723
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,260
If you're killed while doing so,

724
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,100
a proper funeral will be provided.

725
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,260
But if you try to escape,

726
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,900
you will have no funeral.

727
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,260
You will have nothing,

728
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,230
and you will be
apprehended and buried where

729
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,730
we find you.

730
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,900
I sincerely hope we
understand each other.

731
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,030
You better hold up
your end of the deal.

732
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,300
Let's go!
