1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,670
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,970
The price of the operation
is the safe return of Scylla.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,630
See if the buyer left him a message.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,260
Yeah,it's a Miami area code.

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,700
The item.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,630
I'm sure you understand no one
can know where Scylla's going.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,280
Do you know who took it?

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,470
No,but Self and Gretchen do.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,960
- Then you've got your team.
- I'm not working for them.

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,810
There are holes in your r茅sum茅 that
Gretchen or Self or even Bagwell can fill.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,120
What happened?

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,050
He got away.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,000
What's this?

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,090
My resignation.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,590
Whatever plan you're working on to get us
out of here, we better make a move on it.

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,310
You're not getting out of here,Michael.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,540
I made a deal.

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,140
Your life in exchange for Scylla.

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,920
You think you can do that knowing
what you know about the Company?

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,900
You want to know what I
know about the Company?

21
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,930
Mom worked for them before she died.

22
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,430
Now,I'm gonna do everything
and anything I can to end this.

23
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,350
Hello?

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,710
Sara,it's me.

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,240
Where are you?

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,630
Miami. The guy who took Scylla's here.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,620
So you're-you're actually trying
to get it back for the Company?

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,620
I'm gonna give it back to the
Company so we can walk away from this.

29
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,150
How's Michael?

30
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,520
I don't know. I don't know.

31
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,580
Two guys from the Company came, and they
brought me to a hotel, and-and I was given...

32
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,940
flowers and a fruit basket, and
absolutely no information about Michael.

33
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,640
Is Fernando with you?

34
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,450
Sucre split.

35
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,320
We,uh,we left some messages with Mahone,

36
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,240
telling him where we are,but
that was two cell phones back.

37
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,740
Sorry,who's "we"? Who are you with?

38
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,590
People I don't trust.

39
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,620
Okay. Listen,um...

40
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,570
Lincoln,I know why
you did it,and-and...

41
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,890
I'm grateful to you,
because he was gonna die.

42
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,700
But do you really think that they're just
gonna let us live when we give them Scylla?

43
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,440
You know what,Sara, I'm doing my best.

44
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,940
Just-just call me if you hear
anything about Michael,please.

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,660
Linc,the Company's data tech finally
got a hit on our guy's cell phone.

46
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,700
It's a number, and it goes to this
address-- The Grafton; it's a club.

47
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,770
- How many calls?
- Three. All outgoing.

48
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,810
How do we know this guy's still in
Miami, that he hasn't sold it already,huh?

49
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,880
Not that I'm complaing.

50
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,040
I've had some filthy,
filthy times in this state.

51
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,370
Don't screw this up, all right?

52
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,300
Because that's our
only lead on this guy.

53
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,870
Be thankful I haven't killed you.

54
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,670
Oh,yeah? Wh-What are
you, Eliot Ness now?

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,510
What,are you upset because
I screwed you over,Linc?

56
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,200
'Cause don't act like you haven't done
that to ten times as many people. All right?

57
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,440
We're just crooks that
got caught,Lincoln.

58
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,360
This... this guy,this isn't gonna work.

59
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,470
Why don't we all just
focus on who's got Scylla.

60
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,550
What do you say?

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,530
Hey,Scofield.

62
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,990
Where am I?

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,680
- He's awake.
- I said,where am I?

64
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,840
It's a house, in the woods,
60 miles from anywhere.

65
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,060
Swept clean of weapons, so you don't
need to worry your head about that.

66
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,600
There are no bars on
the windows or the doors,

67
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,420
but there are three types
of mountain lion in the area,

68
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,490
so you might want to stay close by.

69
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,120
I'll take it from here.

70
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,210
Dr. Roger Knowlton,Michael.
How are you feeling?

71
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,580
You some kind of neurologist?

72
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,670
Psychiatrist.

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,100
Given that you've got some free time,the
General asked if I'd sit with you.

74
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,280
A cigar's a cigar. Are we done?

75
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,800
You've been operating under some...

76
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,250
misconceptions about the Company, and
the General wants to,uh,open the books.

77
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm here to...

78
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,680
provide facts and to
help you process them.

79
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,410
If by facts,you mean what's on Scylla and
that my mother once worked for the Company,

80
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,090
I already know these things.

81
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,830
"Worked"?

82
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,090
Your mother... worksfor us.

83
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,290
Your mother is alive.

We don't open till 3:00.

88
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,900
I'm just looking for someone.

89
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,540
Haven't got the guy's name, uh,but he
called here yesterday about three times--

90
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,630
New Yorker,dark hair, bits of gray.

91
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,840
You know where I can find him?

92
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,140
Uh,yeah,I can't help you. Sorry.

93
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,850
You sure?

94
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,490
My man,you need to check your ears, all right,'cause
he just said we don't know who you're talking about.

95
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,950
- Is that right?
- Yeah,that's right.

96
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,930
Well,what about blondie?

97
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,180
You've got about two seconds...

98
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,920
How about it?

99
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,080
- I don't know his name.
- How about it!

100
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,380
He works... this girl...
works here, he dates her.

101
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,110
You're gonna take me to her.

102
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,500
Well,this is all just.

103
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,750
fascinating,Doctor.

104
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,050
I don't know how better to say this.

105
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,230
She left you and your
brother to protect you.

106
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,710
From the dangers of
solar synthesis work?

107
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,460
I know what's on Scylla.

108
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,790
There were threats,you and
Lincoln might be kidnapped.

109
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,580
- You were in imminent danger.
- Really.

110
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,360
Where was she when my brother
was strapped to an electric chair?

111
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,190
She'd been working in a Madagascar
rain forest, without satellite access.

112
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,730
Orshe wasn't alive, hasn't been for
25 years, and this is all fiction.

113
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,090
There's a million acres,
corn and soy,outside Cordoba

114
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,290
that was arid scrub before
your mother's research.

115
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,460
That's not fiction, that's food...

116
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,930
for thousands. Millions.

117
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,450
There's so much more
on Scylla than you know.

118
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,150
It sounds like we'd
have a lot to talk about.

119
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,980
Why don't you get her on the phone.

120
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,530
When you're ready.

121
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,390
No time like the present.

122
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,120
When you're ready... to join her.

123
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,250
Us.

124
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,340
That's... what this
conversation is about.

125
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,340
Joing... the Company.

126
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,990
Hey,Erica,it's me.

127
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,300
So,are you coming?

128
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,810
I really need to talk to you.

129
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,840
She's on her way.

130
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,030
<i>{\a6}B there in 1 min</i>

131
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,280
Oh,my God!

132
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,140
Why'd this guy call the
club's phone and not Erica's?

133
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:09,280
I... They fight a lot, so when she
doesn't answer, he calls the club.

134
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,300
What do you want with this guy?

135
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,110
He took something that
belongs to me. I want it back.

136
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,510
There. There's Erica.

137
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,050
Wait here.

138
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,750
Get him stitched up.

139
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,080
Big guy. Shaved head. Crazy.

140
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,010
- Who the hell is he?
- I don't know.

141
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,700
He bought the whole thing about you
being friends with this chick or whatever?

142
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,090
Yeah.

143
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,570
He didn't know I was with you, and by the
time he did,he was trying not to get shot.

144
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,790
You did good.

145
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,290
I just need a smoke so bad.

146
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,760
- Oh,no.
- What?

147
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,770
My wallet.

148
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,950
This is the chick who set me up.

149
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,120
We find her,we find our guy.

150
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,300
Busting up clubs,
firing shots in public.

151
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,610
You keep that up and we're not
going to last here much longer.

152
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,440
I don't plan on staying
here very long. You?

153
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,060
See,that's why I have to
give it up to the General.

154
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,750
He puts four enemies together,
guaranteed dissension.

155
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,290
No alliances form against him.

156
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,920
This is our guy's girlfriend's address.

157
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,180
He's probably gone, but
see what you can find.

158
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,760
This is Tia.

159
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,230
Do you want to know what I
think they were talking about?

160
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,560
I don't care.

161
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,980
Just as long as they keep out of my way.

162
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,750
Same with you.

163
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,780
Send her in.

164
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,350
Sarah! You're looking... rested.

165
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,550
How is the hotel?

166
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,600
I would like to offer my professional
assistance in Michael's rehabilitation.

167
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,730
Kind...

168
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,200
but he's receiving excellent care.

169
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,610
There's nothing for you to worry about.

170
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,130
Whatever it is you have planned for him, I
would simply like to help maintain his health.

171
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,100
And that's appreciated,
but it's impossible.

172
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,700
Believe me, you serve Michael
best at a distance right now.

173
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,500
Trust me.

174
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,020
I have no agenda apart from simply...

175
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,810
wanting to see that he's okay.

176
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,930
And in three days to a week, he'll
be back in your loving arms forever.

177
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,300
Okay,I'm not that patient.

178
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,240
Indulge yourself.

179
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,640
Sit by the pool, envision the
future: financial security,

180
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,020
Michael's talents being
utilized on a global scale,

181
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,820
you beside him innovating.

182
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,340
Michael's talents being
utilized on a global scale?

183
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,870
I'm simply trying to
maximize his potential.

184
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,020
Yours,too.

185
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,870
What's being done to him?

186
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,830
I'm putting an end to this
exhausting cat-and-mouse.

187
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,800
Thank you for stopping by.

188
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,940
"Radical architecture is a rejection
of all formal and moral parameters."

189
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,640
From your thesis.

190
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,060
Someone else's words
heavily paraphrased.

191
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,690
And it pertains to buildings,structures.

192
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,510
I think you meant it as a metaphor.

193
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,150
What,that the ends justify the means?

194
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,670
Which neatly coincides with
your mother's philosophy.

195
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,890
Did you know that she had an almost
identical quote in her thesis?

196
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,500
From 30 years ago.

197
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,360
You've done a lot of homework.

198
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,580
Just a few conversations.

199
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,460
Let me guess.

200
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,980
You two had some kind of moment
at the Company Christmas party?

201
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,070
I've known your mother for years.

202
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,140
Well enough to know you've
got the same brilliant mind

203
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,740
and the same sense of
humor, for that matter.

204
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,310
I'm guessing this isn't
about my sense of humor.

205
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,980
She was just as resistant
to joining the Company,

206
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,010
but then she learned the truth.

207
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:18,040
If the truth is that the Company is all
about saving the world, I don't buy it.

208
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:24,070
And if my mother is so brilliant and active
in the Company, what do you want with me?

209
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:29,080
A fully functioning Scylla project
would exist on a global scale.

210
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,970
It can't be managed by one person.

211
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,180
But two...

212
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,230
equally formidable, working in lockstep?

213
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,660
Absolutely.

214
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,740
That's very good.

215
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,350
You've clearly thought of everything.

216
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,870
Michael...

217
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,570
if I weren't telling you the truth,

218
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,730
how would I have gotten this?

219
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,260
5416 Grand St. 1 Hour

220
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,570
***

221
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,670
This is just a stupid
girl who dates a criminal.

222
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,460
This is a waste of time.

223
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,790
A signature of Burrows' leadership.

224
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,460
All right,we need to make a shift.

225
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,190
Bagwell,I'm telling you right now,if
I make my play and you go soft,

226
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,720
I will sail you off that loft
balcony and no one will bat an eye.

227
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,370
My aim is true,Don.
Keep it in your pants.

228
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,490
I'll keep it in my pants,all right?

229
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,560
All right,all in favor of
changing the regime,say "Aye."

230
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,710
-Aye,aye,Captain.
-Aye.

231
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,200
All right,Burrows is out.

232
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,380
Good,great. Send it.

233
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,670
The Company's e-mailing
Tia's credit card history.

234
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,310
You know,I'm thinking more and
more that this is an inside job.

235
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,490
Why?

236
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,660
A couple reasons.

237
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,480
The hardware he brought to the meet.

238
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,420
He could read Scylla right on the spot.

239
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,250
Since he's disappeared,I should be
able to find this man,and I can't.

240
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,400
People you can't find
are usually Company.

241
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,830
How does that change anything?

242
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,030
It doesn't. It just
makes everything harder.

243
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,920
-Lincoln...
-Yeah?

244
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,460
when are we going to
get this out of the way?

245
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,230
What?

246
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,630
Of all the mercenary humps I've
thrown at guys in my lifetime,

247
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,690
I think I'm due for one I want.

248
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,700
Don't flatter yourself.

249
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,170
Too late.

250
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,720
Name it.

251
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,490
And I do mean anything.

252
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,230
A big ol' fat load of nothin'!

253
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,050
A big ol' goose egg.

254
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,350
Nothing.

255
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,950
Old address books,photographs,hard
drive from her computer.

256
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,150
I checked her e-mails and her Web
sites. There's nothing from our guy.

257
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,270
Are you sure this girlfriend
route is the way to go here?

258
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,270
Because this is starting
to feel like a wasted trip.

259
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,000
How long is it gonna take the Company
to pull everything off this thing?

260
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,560
A couple hours.

261
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,580
All right,Linc,this is the deal.

262
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,130
Look,we appreciate your effort,but
Bagwell and I took a vote,

263
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,640
and this being Florida and
all,you came up a little bit short.

264
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,060
-Meaning?
-You're not in charge.

265
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,760
-Who is?
-Him.

266
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,010
Yeah. The bull-in-the-china- shop routine might
have worked when you were stealing gumballs,

267
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,560
but our asses are on the line now,okay?

268
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,330
And we all have deals with the General.

269
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,250
So that's the way it's gonna be.

270
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,300
And if you notice,even Gretchen
hasn't leapt to your defense.

271
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,200
Linc,just let him wear his crown.

272
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,240
I would if I thought he
wasn't gonna sell this thing.

273
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,940
Oh,what,am I the only one
who's thought about that?

274
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,930
Look,here's the deal,Linc. At
some point,you'll have a vote.

275
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,340
But until then,you're done,all
right? We're shuttin' you down,okay?

276
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,490
You're no longer in charge.

277
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,290
Uh-oh,looks like
there's been a recount.

278
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,330
-Bad time?
-No,perfect.

279
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,880
The second you stop doing
what I tell you to do,

280
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,630
I'm gonna blow your brains out.

281
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,740
Bring her back.

282
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,000
It's not gonna be the same.

283
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,110
Stir any memories?

284
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:26,370
I was ten. We were on a
camping trip in Jackson Hole.

285
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,950
Fishing,hiking.

286
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,080
family huddled under a blanket
in front of the bonfire.

287
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,770
-You can stop now.
-Why?

288
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,040
Because two years later it was gone?

289
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,980
You know,three of the four people
in this photograph are still alive.

290
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,800
So what are you
suggesting,grab my fishing pole?

291
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,560
Time for a... a family
reunion in Wyoming?

292
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,300
Or wherever you like.

293
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,130
Don't tell me it's something
you haven't wished for.

294
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,920
I wished for a lot
of unrealistic things.

295
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,780
I got over them,too.

296
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,330
Why,when we can make this happen?

297
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,460
These pictures could have been
taken anywhere at any time.

298
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,850
Before you were incarcerated,you'd go to visit
her grave on the anniversary of her funeral.

299
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,620
-All right,enough.
-You'd bring a bouquet of blue irises.

300
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,170
-You'd sit for an hour.
-I said stop it.

301
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,760
When you'd leave,you'd take a
flower and pin it to your lapel.

302
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,980
She watched you do this every year.

303
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,190
She's seen the pain you carry.
She wants to make amends.

304
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,390
All right!

305
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,030
So you did a little
digging. Good for you.

306
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,600
But everything out of your mouth is a
lie,and I don't believe a word of it.

307
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,450
So let's just stop.

308
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,950
Let's just stop.

309
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,440
That's Tia's address
right there. Pull it up.

310
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,460
All right,she lives here,works here,

311
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,130
but yesterday she used her credit card to buy
a drink at the Pelican Club a little after noon,

312
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,730
and then she picked up something at
the gift shop a little after 1:00.

313
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,910
Waiting for her boyfriend to debark.

314
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,010
Disembark.

315
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,930
-He's already in town.
-Yeah.

316
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,170
Then he lives in the Marina.

317
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,870
Or this is another reason
to think it's an inside job.

318
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,750
If he's working with someone from the Company, they
wouldn't want their names on any flight manifests.

319
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,450
All right,they're trying to get Scylla
out of the country by boat undetected.

320
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,060
Let's go.

321
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,040
Alex,Yeah?

322
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,530
thanks for coming when you did,man.

323
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,740
You helped me like you said you would.

324
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,490
I owe you.

325
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,000
***

326
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,840
Okay,I'll do the talking.

327
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,190
You guys wait here. Alex,let's go.

328
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,410
Afternoon.

329
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,710
-How's it going?
-What can I do you for?

330
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,730
Recognize her? Her name's Tia Hayden.

331
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,170
Can't say I do. Wish I did.

332
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,750
Nice little tomato there.

333
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,340
She was in here yesterday with a man.

334
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,460
Can't help. Sorry.

335
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,460
Don Self,Homeland Security.

336
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,290
And this is my partner Bruce Liberace.

337
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,700
No relation.

338
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,360
Our department is working with the
Office of Foreign Assets Control.

339
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,610
Have you heard of them?

340
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,680
-Yep.
-Bet you have.

341
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,850
We're looking into smuggling and
contraband transportation of Cuban cigars.

342
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,970
None here,swear to God.

343
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,830
All right,well,that's for us to decide.

344
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,500
It's going to take about a week,

345
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,640
and it's going to involve
shutting down this entire marina...

346
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,550
-Oh,yeah.
-for about a week.

347
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,870
-Or...
-She was here with that guy you were talking about.

348
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,810
He wanted to know which berth a
private charter was docking in.

349
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,130
He asked me to move it further
down the dock,which I did.

350
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,890
Further away from the Coast Guard slip?

351
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,820
I didn't ask. And I
didn't accept any money.

352
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,170
If he said he paid me,he's lying.

353
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,930
What's the point of departure?

354
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,540
Nassau,Bahamas. Round trip.

355
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,470
-When does it arrive?
-Arrived.

356
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,060
Hey,everybody!

357
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,580
Okay,my name is Don
Self! Homeland Security.

358
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,490
My colleagues and I are hoping that
you guys have a wonderful and safe trip.

359
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,580
Unfortunately,we're going to have
to do a quick luggage check search.

360
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,550
Shouldn't take more than a minute,folks.

361
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,780
Your cooperation is all that's required.

362
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,790
Open your bags.***

363
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,210
Get on your knees!

364
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,450
Okay,okay,okay.

365
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,700
Where is it? Where's Scylla?

366
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,690
What have you got in here?

367
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,070
Three joints.

368
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,920
I'm on probation.

369
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,240
Is this going to send me back?

370
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,860
Make yourself a helmet,pal.

371
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,260
Just like old times.

372
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,820
Bring her back.

373
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,020
You know I can't do that.

374
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,530
But,look,there's some stuff that Icando.

375
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,400
It's not going to be the same,but
we're going to figure it out.

376
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,080
And,no matter what,it's
still going to be me and you.

377
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,440
I am thrilled that you're enjoying
your trip to the mountains,

378
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,400
but it's not an open-ended vacation.

379
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,350
Scofield's exhausted.

380
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,400
Despondent.

381
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,440
He's very resistant,but a classic
abandoned child. He'll come around.

382
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,190
Time frame,Doctor?

383
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,190
Unaided,three days.

384
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,780
With the pentothal?

385
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,100
Sooner,but it's nearly
a chemical lobotomy.

386
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,690
But,if he turns on his own,it'll
be his decision,his reasoning.

387
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,600
We'll own him forever.

388
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,620
Scofield's squirrelly.

389
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,830
I won't trust him till
he walks hot coals.

390
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,350
-I think I can get him there.
-Good.

391
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,750
But,if I find out he's
been playing you,Doctor,

392
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,630
you'll get the same
lobotomy as Scofield.

393
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,630
Just get it done.

394
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,220
Go!

395
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,920
Hello,I'm a Mac.

396
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,440
If you fight when those cuffs are off,the
guards will stomp the life out of you.

397
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,030
Yeah.

398
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,700
Forgive the dramatics. The Company
can't know I'm talking to you.

399
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,710
Youarethe Company. You're his daughter.

400
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,260
-Do you want to find Michael Scofield?
-Of course I do.

401
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,400
It's 60 miles northeast of
downtown. I'd move quickly.

402
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,290
-What are they doing to him?
-Having lemonade.

403
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,330
They're carving out his
personality. That's how they recruit.

404
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,600
Or you're setting me up.

405
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,920
Clandestine warfare isn't pretty, but the rules of
engagement don't include killing and torturing the innocent.

406
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,550
At least not for me.

407
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,790
Michael is the object of a quick and
nasty process,and you're wasting time.

408
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,610
Out.

409
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,180
Out.

410
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,640
We need the footage from
that security camera.

411
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,680
Not to offend either of you,but I
took the liberty of calling my attorney

412
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,990
to find out exactly what the scope of
your authority is here,and he tells me...

413
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,350
Just get the tape,all right?

414
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,600
***

415
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,800
-Either we missed Scylla...
-No,no,no.We did not miss Scylla.

416
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,570
We searched every bag.

417
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,770
Then maybe the buyer was already on
the boat,and wasdisembarking,right?

418
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:51,010
I mean,if they don't want their names on any
flight manifest,maybe they just eased back on in.

419
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,550
That wouldn't be the worst news.

420
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,810
-That means they're in Miami.
-Right.

421
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,450
So get yourself back down with your
disgraced badge to Steamboat Willie,

422
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,230
and have him cough up every name of
every person on that boat coming off.

423
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:08,260
Okay,that's good,because they probably would have
traveled in on a low-grade charter from the Bahamas,

424
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,360
and used their real names,right?

425
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,400
That would be a good plan.

426
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,290
-How is he?
-He's alive.

427
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,380
So we get Scylla.

428
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,480
Then we're free,all
of us-- Pam,LJ...

429
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,160
All of a sudden,the
Company grew a heart?

430
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,980
They're just tired of us. They
want Scylla back.That's it.

431
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,940
-Then we never really had anything they wanted.
-Exactly.

432
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,040
Now we got leverage.

433
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,660
We don't have it yet.

434
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:48,150
- Anything?- No.

435
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,830
Nothing yet.Nothing.

436
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,590
No,Lincoln,you don't understand.

437
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,460
The way she said "recruit" made my stomach turn.

438
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,850
They're going to torture him.

439
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,870
He can take care of himself,at least for one day,until we get Scylla.

440
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,270
Lincoln,he needs to be in the ICU.

441
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,000
What's your plan?Break him out?

442
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,390
I don't know.I don't have one.

443
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,650
Well,you're putting him and us at risk.

444
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,920
Just stay in the hotel until we get back to L.A.All right?

445
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,310
Yes?

446
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,530
Tancredi got the location of her shining knight.

447
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,390
She may be heading there now.

448
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,270
Exemplary,Bagwell.

449
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,940
Thank you,sir.

450
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,110
A deal's a deal,right?

451
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,720
Not to be a broken record,but all I ask...

452
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,790
But I think we're making some real progress,General.

453
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:03,290
The Scofield/Burrows family would have been a formidable asset to the Company,

454
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,770
but since his lapdog insists on complicating matters,we move on.

455
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,260
General,we can handle a lone female.

456
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,280
If,indeed,that's what we're dealing with.

457
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,880
But it's my experience,that with the one comes many.

458
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,980
Do it now,Doctor.

459
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,380
I need an hour.

460
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,810
He just ate.I don't want him to aspirate.

461
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,480
Now,Doctor.

462
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,010
I want Scofield pliable for transit.

463
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,280
Your vehicle arrives in 20 minutes.

464
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,270
And if we can't revive him?

465
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,960
C'est la vie!

466
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,920
Michael,come out.

467
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,620
We need to talk.

468
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,920
Think of something.

469
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,110
That's it!That's our guy!

470
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,450
There's Tia right beside him.

471
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,230
We've got to pull that image,get it to the Company,and have them match it.

472
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,940
Where's Gretchen?

473
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,430
How'd you find me?

474
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,760
Once I found your mug shot,it really wasn't that hard getting your legit cell number.

475
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,500
Well,now I'm here.What do you want?

476
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,040
You never bothered to ask back in Los Angeles--

477
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,720
you were too busy planning on killing me--

478
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,200
but I actually worked for the Company.

479
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,260
I know who you are.

480
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,560
And I'll ask it again.

481
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,190
What do you want?

482
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,060
To solve your problems,Scott.

483
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,190
I mean,it is what gets me up out of bed in the morning.

484
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,630
You have a big problem,and so does whoever it is you're working for.

485
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,190
And you obviously know that or you wouldn't have graced me with your presence.

486
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,210
And you can make that problem disappear?

487
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,200
Quickly and completely.

488
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,800
With an extra added bonus.

489
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,730
Crucial,I might add.

490
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,130
I then feed the Company a story that has them looking elsewhere.

491
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,750
Meaning you're invaluable and please don't kill you.

492
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,240
Yeah.

493
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,390
Without the "please."

494
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,500
- How much?- A lot.

495
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,960
And it's about to double here in a second if you don't look at me when I'm talking to you.

496
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,370
You go run and talk it over with your boss.

497
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,760
Call me with a number.

498
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,970
I'm authorized to negotiate on their behalf.

499
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,380
If you serve up whoever's looking for us and get the Company off our scent--

500
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,110
$10 million.

501
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,090
Best and final offer.

502
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,950
Ask for a penny more and I'll shoot you in the chest and take my chances.

503
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,930
Take it easy,Michael.

504
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,930
This...is for your own good.

505
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,050
What was that?

506
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,480
Sounded like the water heater.

507
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,930
Came from the bathroom.

508
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,460
Pick it up!

509
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,950
*******

510
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,950
Now give the doctor his medicine.

511
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,220
No.

512
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,220
Bedpost.

513
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,700
In here,in the bedroom.

514
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,400
Come on!

515
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,620
Uncuff me now!

516
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,880
hat's great.

517
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,600
Thank you.Perfect.

518
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,530
Let me know if you hear anything else.

519
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,870
Where the hell you been?

520
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,620
Figuring this whole thing out.

521
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,480
I know who it is.The buyer.

522
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,600
His name is lawrence wilcott and he'srkn woing for the company for ten years.

523
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,000
How did you figure that out?

524
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,730
I still have friends on the inside,and on the outside of the company.

525
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,750
I've been putting together a profile,narrowing down the candidates.

526
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:05,620
Wilcott got on a plane in bogot* and flew to the bahamas yesterday and then got on a boat.

527
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,250
The guy who took scylla off us in L.A.?

528
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,960
We pulled his image off the security tape.

529
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,390
Company's running a recognition match right now.

530
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,620
That's great,but that's going to take all day.

531
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,970
Do you know wher he is right now?

532
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,130
With wilcott.We need to go now.

533
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,650
Because better yet,I know where wilcott's staying.

534
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,150
Okay,we need to move before scylla does.

535
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,460
Let's go.Let's go.

536
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,430
****

537
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:14,030
Turn around!

538
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,680
Punch it,we gotta get out of here!

539
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,840
Michael,get in!

540
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,550
He's rented out the entire top floor.

541
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,760
Security at every point.

542
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,410
We might want to get to an employee-- bribe 'em.

543
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,730
Top level company in a big glass building.

544
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,790
nice and slow.

545
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,670
Get your hands up.

546
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,760
This is everyone?

547
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,690
You whore.

548
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:04,610
You're a whore,and your mother waore,a wh and her mother,

549
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,080
and your father used to turn tricks at a gas station,

550
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,170
'cause he was a whore,too.

551
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,760
Bye,tie.

552
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,540
Sorry,but right now I want my life back more than I want your money.

553
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,650
Where's scylla?

554
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,830
Well,let's talk about that,okay?

555
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,140
Let'S.Where is it?

556
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,860
I can get it.

557
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,550
No,he can'T.

558
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,270
He's stalling,linc.

559
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,120
- It's gone.- You're right.

560
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,760
And since all you guys can kiss my ass,

561
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,240
there's only one thing I want to accomplish right now.

562
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,510
Lawrence wilcott?The whole floor of the hotel rented out?

563
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,700
Made it up.

564
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,970
You have no idea who this guy was working for?

565
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,650
Chenno.

566
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,340
No clue.

567
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,030
we gotta pull the pin here,guys.

568
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,960
Just because she switched sides at the last second doesn't mean

569
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,340
she wasn't going to kill us two minutes ago,okay?

570
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,930
Kill her.

571
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,710
All right,we're not leaving her here for the cops

572
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,660
and we're not taking her to the hospital.

573
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,020
Why?

574
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,190
I didn't let you get slaughtered.

575
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,190
- She's got a kid.- So what?

576
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,950
Are we killing the kid?

577
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,540
The kid doesn't even know it's her mother.

578
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,160
Come on,linc,pull the trigger.Do it.

579
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,470
Her name's emily-- she's only eight years old.Come on.

580
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,690
Do it.

581
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,240
We're not them.

582
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,430
you keep your mouth shut,and you get to see your kid in visitation.

583
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,960
I know what the general will do to me for talking.

584
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,930
Believe me.I know him well.

585
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,060
Are you serious?

586
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,310
Let's go,let's go.

587
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,750
What happened?

588
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,260
You haven't said a word.

589
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,840
I think my mother's alive.

590
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,900
That's his cell phone.Answer it.

591
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,960
Hello.Hello.

592
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,710
Your boy's dead.

593
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,490
And now I'm coming after you.

594
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,590
Did you hear me?

595
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,210
Whoever you are,I'm coming after you.

596
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,040
Who was that?

597
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,540
It was my son--

598
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,700
lincoln.


9999
