1
00:00:02,315 --> 00:00:04,010
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:04,183 --> 00:00:06,117
It was a meeting between all cardholders.

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:08,253
Now we know
who has the other five cards.

4
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:10,188
Your nose is bleeding.

5
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:14,853
- I'm Cole Pfeiffer.
- Welcome to Los Angeles.

6
00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:16,517
His name is Theodore Bagwell.

7
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:19,358
He was with us in Panama.
Now he's here in Los Angeles.

8
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:22,126
And he has a book
that used to belong to Whistler.

9
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:24,599
Mahone thinks this book
has a plan for the break-in.

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,931
Cole Pfeiffer did not arrive
for our meeting.

11
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:28,733
You don't have Scylla?

12
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:34,445
It seems your friend Whistler
wasn't the only one looking into Scylla.

13
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:36,548
- Do you know anything about that?
- No.

14
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:42,047
I'm looking for the man who killed my son.
This man is a professional assassin.

15
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:45,748
He's African-American, 6-foot-4,
about 220 pounds.

16
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:14,253
We refined the images
the best we could...

17
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,379
...but we need your specialists to sharpen
the video so we can ID the rest of them.

18
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:22,288
All right, I'll see what I can do. I've seen
what those tech guys are capable of.

19
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:24,053
Sometimes it's...

20
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:26,830
Wait a sec. I know this guy.

21
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:29,331
This guy works in my building.
That's Griffin Oren.

22
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:32,835
- You know him?
- He's the head of Treasury's L.A. Bureau.

23
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:35,439
If he's in your building,
you can get close to him.

24
00:01:35,608 --> 00:01:37,337
- I need a reason.
- Make something up.

25
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,343
Something about al Qaeda
using stolen bearer bonds...

26
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:43,346
...to finance shady operations. Whatever.

27
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:47,282
Making false claims affecting government?
That's up to five years in prison.

28
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:49,148
Welcome to the club, Agent Self.

29
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:18,040
Thanks for meeting me.

30
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:20,310
I would have come up to see you,
but I can't...

31
00:02:20,486 --> 00:02:22,147
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:24,653
But you said that you had some pictures
to show me.

33
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:45,666
That's him.

34
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:50,905
I'll get in touch with you as soon as...

35
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,643
Soon as I...

36
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,924
You didn't do this.

37
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:09,033
In your heart, you are a really good man.

38
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:12,796
That's why I married you.

39
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:17,238
That's why I started a family with you.

40
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,611
When you used to bring your files home...

41
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:31,120
...and I would beg you
to leave that stuff at work.

42
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:34,856
But when you have a monster
in your sights...

43
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:40,531
...you can't focus until you get him.

44
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:43,463
And I used to hate that about you.

45
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:49,000
Now it's the only thing that lets me sleep,
because I know...

46
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:52,970
...that you're gonna get him.

47
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:42,684
What the hell are you doing?

48
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:47,028
Move.

49
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:50,556
- What are you doing?
- Hey, there, Blauner.

50
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,759
Just doing a little research.

51
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,396
- GATE-related?
- Adding a little flourish to my pitch.

52
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,869
Like the caged macaw
who cannot spread her wings...

53
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,302
Well, you know, Cole...

54
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:05,409
...I was thinking maybe you should
spend less time practicing...

55
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:07,808
...and a little more time actually pitching.

56
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,312
I mean, number-one salesman
in the world?

57
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:14,418
We're just waiting with bated breath
to see what you can do around here.

58
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:05,403
I just saw him right here.

59
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,198
- Hey.
- Hey.

60
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:12,741
- You haven't seen Sara, have you?
- No.

61
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:16,773
Look, you wanna end up back in Fox River,
just go right ahead.

62
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:19,783
Hey, what's going on?

63
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:22,944
- He wants to look for T-Bag.
- We know he's got the bird book.

64
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:25,215
The bird book's got the plan
for the break-in.

65
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:28,622
And we saw that snake right here today.

66
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:31,319
It ain't safe
for a member of the Fox River Eight...

67
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:34,193
...to be looking for another member
of the Fox River Eight.

68
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:35,890
Yes, but...

69
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:40,029
Bellick, go with Sucre. Canvas the area.
See if you can get a lead on him.

70
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:42,799
There are six buildings there.
He could be in any one.

71
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:45,341
That's why it's called canvassing.

72
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,817
You do realize
this is the Treasury Department, right?

73
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:58,150
Tell Self to go down a few floors,
walk past the right computers...

74
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:00,757
...and we are billionaires.
- Just the card, please.

75
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,165
Don Self, Homeland Security.

76
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,234
- I need to see Mr. Oren.
- Not available.

77
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:15,271
I need to see him right away, otherwise
hundreds of Americans will be in jeopardy.

78
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:19,508
- Don Self, Homeland Security.
- Talk to Angela down the hall.

79
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:21,509
Sorry to barge in, but this is urgent.

80
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,376
I'm sure it is.
Talk to Angela down the hall.

81
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,814
We are hearing chatter
about stolen bearer bonds.

82
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:30,079
- We have reason to believe al Qaeda...
- Do you have serial numbers?

83
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:31,586
No, I do not.

84
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,728
- Mind turning around?
- Not at all.

85
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:56,214
I leave for Asia in six hours.

86
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:58,909
He's got it.

87
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:05,585
Until then, I've got meetings
with the bureau chiefs...

88
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:07,988
...of the FBI, the CIA,
and Homeland Security.

89
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:10,990
It's gone.

90
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:15,863
If what you have to tell me is important,
I'll hear about it from your boss.

91
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:20,066
Until then, talk to Angela down the hall.

92
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:23,140
If you set foot in my office again
without my prior consent...

93
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:28,336
...I will see to it you spend the rest of your
career running border security in Alaska.

94
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:34,810
Did we get it?

95
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:36,614
<i>- What happened?
- What do you mean?</i>

96
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:39,587
We had it for two seconds
and then it disappeared.

97
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:40,782
It's in the safe.

98
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,417
He has this safe in his office.
That must be blocking the transmission.

99
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:46,120
That's where he keeps the card.

100
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:49,096
- We need to get into that safe.
- Trust me, there's no way.

101
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:53,034
I'll have the enhanced images of the other
cardholders. We'll go from there.

102
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:55,639
Now, you can access
the building's blueprints, right?

103
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:56,968
I can't go back up there.

104
00:09:57,142 --> 00:10:00,703
- We'll take care of that.
- You'll never get past the front door.

105
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,677
Even if they don't recognize you,
you need a security card...

106
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:06,317
Just get the blueprints
and get back here, all right?

107
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:07,952
Yeah.

108
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:13,315
- Sara, what happened?
- I'm fine, but someone was following me.

109
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:16,518
I lost him a mile back.
I don't think he could have followed me.

110
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:18,925
- I made sure of that.
- What'd he look like?

111
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:21,964
- Tall, black, he had a beard.
- Is this the guy?

112
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:26,695
Yeah.

113
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,831
Who's that?

114
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:31,375
That's the man who killed my son.

115
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:35,144
Now he's coming to kill us.

116
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:44,920
Where were you
the first time that you saw him?

117
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,115
- The very first time.
- Walking home.

118
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,852
He didn't just run into you on the street.

119
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:51,928
Where were you before that?

120
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:54,992
- The Towne Lounge.
- Is that a bar?

121
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:57,065
You have a problem with that?

122
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:01,269
No. I just wanna know
how long you were there.

123
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:05,834
Sara, I need to find this guy
and I can't do it without your help.

124
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:09,777
I don't care why or what you were doing
in the bar. I just wanna know how long...

125
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:11,916
- Okay, a couple hours.
- Thank you.

126
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:14,552
So something must have tipped him off.

127
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,911
- You paid cash, right?
- Of course.

128
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,557
But the credit card
that Bruce gave me is gone.

129
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,124
What credit card?

130
00:11:25,564 --> 00:11:27,725
These are the security checkpoints.

131
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,698
You can't get past one of those
unless you have one of these.

132
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:32,097
Any way we can forge it?

133
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:36,207
Sure, if you have two weeks and access
to the building's mainframe, maybe.

134
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,674
It doesn't look there are any security
checkpoints on the 10th floor.

135
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:42,279
No, just at all the access points
to the 10th floor.

136
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:45,974
But if you could somehow magically appear
in the hallway, you'd be fine...

137
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:49,882
...except for all the government officials
who'd arrest you in a heartbeat.

138
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:53,286
If you get us into the parking structure,
will security check our van?

139
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,653
Sure, transporting known felons.
Why not?

140
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:58,824
The parking structure.
Then this is our point of entry.

141
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:00,464
We need the details of the safe.

142
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:09,500
Okay, the safe has an insignia on it...

143
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:13,270
...that looks something like this.

144
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:24,714
You're gonna need some of this.

145
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:46,204
I got a positive ID of Sara Tancredi
in Los Angeles.

146
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:48,175
That means Michael Scofield is here.

147
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:51,976
That means Lincoln Burrows is here.
Why?

148
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,981
Sara, huh?

149
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:58,717
She's a slippery little bitch, isn't she?

150
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:03,953
Time is not on your side, Gretchen.

151
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:06,689
Maybe you hadn't noticed...

152
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:12,159
...but since you seem to be
somewhat immune to physical coercion...

153
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:14,965
...we've decided to move on.

154
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,777
The nose is an evolutionary marvel.

155
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:27,041
Our brain has been constructed
so that certain aromas...

156
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:31,217
...coffee beans, blueberries...

157
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,951
...that are helpful to our body,
we perceive as pleasant.

158
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:40,656
Whereas other smells
that signify death, disease...

159
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:46,236
Initial symptoms
include nausea, dizziness, burning eyes.

160
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:49,101
All of which
you are experiencing right now.

161
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:52,072
Prolonged exposure
will lead to faintness...

162
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:55,270
...rapid degradation
of your mental faculties.

163
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:58,477
Tell me.

164
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,284
I don't know anything.

165
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:05,686
You've got one more day.

166
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:26,501
Top of the line.

167
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:31,111
It's a biometric design,
and only Oren's fingerprint will open it.

168
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:34,781
So we lift his prints
off something he touched.

169
00:14:34,953 --> 00:14:36,818
The pad knows
what human skin feels like.

170
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:41,015
If we trick it, we'll set off the alarm.
And then there's the 12-digit key code.

171
00:14:41,193 --> 00:14:43,184
- What about the hinges?
- Wired to the alarm.

172
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:45,886
- We drill it.
- Through the outer layer of steel, maybe.

173
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:49,795
But the bones of this thing are
three-quarter-inch cobalt-alloy hard plate.

174
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:52,334
Drilling's not gonna work,
not in our time frame.

175
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:54,938
Basically we have a way
to get you into the garage...

176
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:58,304
...which in case you forgot,
puts me on the hook for other charges.

177
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,604
But no way
to get you up to the 10th floor.

178
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,770
But let's say you do get to the 10th floor.

179
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:05,917
Then we need to get you
into Oren's office for an hour.

180
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:08,917
Then we need to hope
that not one of Oren's coworkers...

181
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:11,647
...is gonna hear the loud drill
you're gonna be using...

182
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:14,917
...to break into a safe
that I'm telling you cannot be broken into.

183
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:17,857
You understand? There are
Homeland agents whose sole job...

184
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:21,089
...is to design safety measures
to make this structure impregnable.

185
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:24,201
Yeah.
They had those guys at Fox River too.

186
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:29,701
- Whose office is this?
- Sam Middleton, Department of Justice.

187
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,173
This wall separates Middleton from Oren.

188
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:36,272
I'm gonna need some supplies.

189
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:40,450
The credit card was used at the bar
at 10:32.

190
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,917
- What time did you see him?
- About 11:00.

191
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:45,613
And how long were you walking
at that time?

192
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,848
Ten-, 15 minutes.

193
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:50,586
Let's assume that he was at his place
when he received the call.

194
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:54,730
That's an 18-minute drive
from the Towne Lounge bar in San Pedro.

195
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,337
Averaging 30 miles an hour the whole way,
that's a nine-mile radius.

196
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:01,734
He's gonna be somewhere
around that circle.

197
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:02,999
He's gotta be mobile.

198
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:07,339
Within a half mile of a major freeway.
The 10, the 110, the 405.

199
00:16:08,113 --> 00:16:10,411
No permanent address,
so we're looking for hotels.

200
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:14,575
But nowhere you need to valet your car.
It's gotta be readily accessible at all times.

201
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:17,984
Somewhere you don't need a credit card
down for incidentals. Got that?

202
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:20,056
I'll see what I can do.

203
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:22,325
Hurry.

204
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:29,490
Trishanne, I'm gonna need a mug of tea
with lemon.

205
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm sorry, Cole.
I can't leave the desk right now.

206
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,501
Good help is so hard to find.

207
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:45,775
- May I help you?
- We're with Upper Valley Insurance.

208
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:49,785
And this man just came into
a $ 100,000 inheritance.

209
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:53,789
We can't track him down,
so we're offering 10 percent finder's fees...

210
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,553
...to anyone who can point us
in his direction.

211
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:59,754
- Oh, my gosh. What, $ 10,000?
- Yeah.

212
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,743
I'm sorry, I don't recognize him.

213
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:20,612
Okay, so if you do see him,
would you please give us a call?

214
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,812
Thank you.

215
00:17:25,757 --> 00:17:28,385
- GATE?
- Greatness Achieved Through Excellence.

216
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:50,476
A toy? You wanna try to explain this?

217
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:54,874
Mix aluminum powder with iron oxide,
add a little heat.

218
00:17:57,656 --> 00:17:58,987
Hey.

219
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:01,785
Yeah, well,
thanks for calling me back, Sam.

220
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:06,395
Yeah, I know you have
these trial dates coming up...

221
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:10,364
...and we just wanna make sure you have
everything to convict these bastards.

222
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:14,836
Okay. That's terrific.

223
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:17,207
All right, I'll see you then.

224
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,138
All right. We're gonna have lunch.

225
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:21,779
I'll keep him out of his office
for as long as I can.

226
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:23,573
Good luck.

227
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:25,972
All right.

228
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,717
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, any sign of him?</i>

229
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:36,520
No, we checked about 10 buildings,
but nothing so far.

230
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:38,686
<i>Scrap it. We're going after the next card.</i>

231
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:42,355
Meet me on the corner of Santa Monica
and Century West.

232
00:18:57,716 --> 00:19:00,378
- Hey, Charlie.
- Yankees lost again last night.

233
00:19:00,552 --> 00:19:03,385
At least our fans show up
before the fifth inning, right?

234
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:06,752
- Have a good day, all right, Charlie?
- You too, Mr. Self.

235
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:28,536
I'm letting you guys know right now,
if you get busted, don't mention my name.

236
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,754
We're ready.

237
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:59,770
- Working with several personnel.
- Okay. Yeah.

238
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,759
Now.

239
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:22,056
One, two, three, up.

240
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:30,002
So...

241
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:33,372
...a couple of scruffy guys walk in...

242
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:36,139
...tell me they're from
the insurance company...

243
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:41,342
...and they offer me $ 10,000
if I know where you are.

244
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,948
Something tells me there's a better offer
on the table.

245
00:20:46,324 --> 00:20:49,487
Well, I'll be, Trishanne.
You just caught yourself a leprechaun.

246
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:53,021
And as the legend goes,
you got yourself one wish.

247
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:55,063
- Anything in the world.
- Oh, really?

248
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:58,100
- And I am bound to grant it.
- Yeah?

249
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,336
Well, your commencement check
is sitting on my desk waiting to be signed.

250
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:04,134
That's a pretty nice pot of gold.

251
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:07,173
Before you say another word...

252
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:14,008
...now it's true, leprechauns cannot refuse
their captor's demands.

253
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:16,779
But if they deem her to be greedy
or covetous...

254
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:23,326
...whatever she desires will certainly be
accompanied with disastrous tidings.

255
00:21:26,097 --> 00:21:28,065
Or so the legend goes.

256
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:34,503
Three percent of your commission
from here on out.

257
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:38,303
Done.

258
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:46,779
Don Self to see you.

259
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:48,710
You can go right on in.

260
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:51,412
- All right, thank you. Have a great day.
- You too.

261
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:57,791
Hey. Hey, Sam.

262
00:21:57,962 --> 00:21:59,361
- Great to meet you.
- Same here.

263
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:02,056
Thanks again for squeezing me in
on such short notice.

264
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:05,760
I figure we had so much to get through
that this would be the best way.

265
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:10,106
- I thought we were going out for lunch.
- Is there a problem?

266
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:14,735
Well, actually, I'm a vegetarian.

267
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:20,148
It's a new diet. But there's a great place
down the street, and it'll be my treat.

268
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,544
<i>- Elise?
- Yes, sir?</i>

269
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:25,450
I'm heading out for lunch.

270
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:52,906
Hold it there.

271
00:22:56,955 --> 00:23:00,891
Sorry, I was just coming in to...
There's no more tp in the ladies' room.

272
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,119
- We'll get right on that.
- How about you get it right now?

273
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:11,659
Best we got in here.

274
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:33,482
You guys need to get better organized.

275
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:52,466
Fifty-three hotels
matched the search criteria.

276
00:23:57,148 --> 00:23:59,981
You know, I read this article
a little while ago, right...

277
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:04,879
...about the whole nature-versus-nurture
thing, and it turns out...

278
00:24:05,056 --> 00:24:07,854
...it's all kind of a mismatch
because DNA trumps everything.

279
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:13,921
And I believe it, because,
I mean, I grew up in the same house...

280
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:17,226
...went to the same school as my brother,
who's a math professor.

281
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:18,733
My sister's a pediatrician...

282
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:21,929
...and I'm a thief who blows his money
on hookers and coke.

283
00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:25,200
So like the same way Scofield's hardwired
to be a genius...

284
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:27,708
...and you were always
gonna be a lawman, right?

285
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,039
Whoever this guy is...

286
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:32,341
...you think he wanted to grow up
to be a murderer? Probably not.

287
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:38,448
Be very careful choosing the next words
that come out of your mouth.

288
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:45,892
I'm just saying...

289
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:47,856
...we are who we are.

290
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:01,735
Oh, man.

291
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,119
Jake, I'm gonna need you
in front of Room 1018, now.

292
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:10,754
- What's going on?
- I apologize...

293
00:25:10,922 --> 00:25:13,948
...but we're gonna be in your way
for the next 90 minutes or so.

294
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:17,020
- Black?
- Yep.

295
00:25:17,195 --> 00:25:20,528
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where can I plug in?

296
00:25:20,698 --> 00:25:24,862
For now, you can go in there. But when my
boss gets back from lunch, you're gonna...

297
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:56,263
The safe should be somewhere
behind this wall.

298
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:31,429
As soon as you're through the steel
I'll have the thermite ready.

299
00:26:37,408 --> 00:26:40,104
- What is it?
- How long has it been happening?

300
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:43,574
- It's not a big deal.
- It was a big deal when you were 13.

301
00:26:43,748 --> 00:26:46,182
- Promise me you won't tell Sara.
- Sara can help.

302
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,046
Look, I'm acclimating
to the warmer climate, all right?

303
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,654
Come on, we've got work to do.

304
00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:53,883
Let's go.

305
00:27:00,865 --> 00:27:02,765
I don't know
what this Company is up to...

306
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:06,301
...but it sure sounds like
there's a whole lot of money involved.

307
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:08,502
Yeah, I don't know.

308
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:12,503
Lisa Tabak just hopped a flight to Laos,
didn't she?

309
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:14,736
- Yeah, I guess.
- Griffin Oren just said...

310
00:27:14,912 --> 00:27:17,142
...he was going somewhere in Asia.

311
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:30,323
- Down to the cobalt.
- All right.

312
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:59,451
- What can I get you?
- Just a moment of your time.

313
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:03,025
I'm a private investigator. I'm working
with a woman named Sara Tancredi.

314
00:28:03,194 --> 00:28:06,425
- And she was recently a patron of yours.
- I don't wanna get involved.

315
00:28:08,566 --> 00:28:11,933
She moved all the way across the country
to get away from this guy.

316
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:16,698
Help me find him before he finds her.

317
00:28:20,878 --> 00:28:23,642
Last time Sara had a broken jaw.

318
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:30,814
I was standing by the front door
when he left.

319
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:33,786
A second later, I saw him
take something out of his car.

320
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,256
- Do you remember what the car looked like?
- Gray.

321
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:39,590
A sedan, sort of like one of those
rental cars, you know?

322
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:52,900
You need something?

323
00:28:55,546 --> 00:28:57,639
Just a small...

324
00:28:58,349 --> 00:28:59,907
...kindness.

325
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:07,917
That's the easiest 300 you'll ever make.

326
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:19,496
Hey, hey, hey.

327
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:21,130
We're working here.

328
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:25,798
So am I.

329
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:29,041
There's a stack of letters
that I need to put in the mail.

330
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:31,545
The chemicals
don't react so good with leather.

331
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:34,617
- What are you using, lye?
- Wait, wait, wait.

332
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:38,345
Listen, we know this is a hassle.

333
00:29:38,522 --> 00:29:41,320
We know we're disrupting your work
and giving you a headache.

334
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:43,255
We annoy a different person every day.

335
00:29:43,427 --> 00:29:46,726
But if this gets dirty while it's wet,
it's gonna leave a stain...

336
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:49,661
...and then we'll be back here
all over again.

337
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:53,365
Why don't you just tell me where they are
and I'll get them for you.

338
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:57,197
On the corner of his desk
near his computer.

339
00:30:01,045 --> 00:30:03,377
- How much longer?
- Another couple minutes...

340
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:05,538
...and we'll be ready to copy.

341
00:30:24,635 --> 00:30:27,661
- Is Griffin in?
- He's in a meeting right now.

342
00:30:27,838 --> 00:30:30,272
But I can pull him out if you like.

343
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:31,499
If you could.

344
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:34,769
Just have a seat in his office.
He'll be right with you.

345
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:46,052
All we need is one more.

346
00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:52,992
Someone's in there.

347
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,217
- Lf I can hear him, he's gonna hear the drill.
- We can do it manually.

348
00:31:23,394 --> 00:31:27,262
- It won't generate enough heat.
- We're like a 16th of an inch away.

349
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,603
- Can I help you?
- I phoned earlier about one of your guests.

350
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:14,969
- Gray sedan, right?
- Yeah, right.

351
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:19,012
Is that the guy?

352
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:22,882
Yeah, that's him.

353
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:25,882
- What room?
- He was in 130.

354
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:27,785
He checked out.

355
00:32:33,497 --> 00:32:35,624
Did he leave any clue
as to where he was going?

356
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:43,502
Do you mind if I look at the room?

357
00:32:43,674 --> 00:32:45,835
Nineteen dollars an hour,
59 for the night.

358
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,342
Fine, whatever. Give me a key.

359
00:33:14,972 --> 00:33:15,996
Yes?

360
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:18,737
You wanted to know
if anyone came looking for you.

361
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:20,433
Did they?

362
00:33:23,314 --> 00:33:25,214
No, I was just calling to let you know...

363
00:33:25,382 --> 00:33:27,373
...my shift was ending
and nobody showed up.

364
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:29,519
<i>All right. Thank you.</i>

365
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:35,287
What do you say you give me that paper
in your hand. How's that sound?

366
00:33:42,032 --> 00:33:45,126
Sorry for keeping you.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

367
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:47,736
Just making sure you're ready
for your trip.

368
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:49,930
I better be. I'm leaving in five minutes.

369
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:54,605
If we dial it down to the lowest setting,
that might work.

370
00:33:54,778 --> 00:33:56,575
- You sure?
- We don't have a choice.

371
00:33:56,747 --> 00:33:57,771
I'll tell you when.

372
00:33:57,948 --> 00:34:00,883
The finance minister
is anxiously awaiting your arrival.

373
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:04,509
Well, if you recall,
I successfully negotiated financial policies...

374
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:07,054
...with the IMF and the World Bank.

375
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,956
Pretty sure I can handle Laos.

376
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:12,094
Now.

377
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:21,969
I'm well aware of your résumé, Griffin.

378
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,232
We got it.

379
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,750
<i>- We're in.
- Got it.</i>

380
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:47,328
<i>The runaway inflation in Laos
has given way to food riots...</i>

381
00:34:47,498 --> 00:34:53,164
<i>... in the capital city of Vientiane,
where the death toll has risen to over 200.</i>

382
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:15,982
Monetary policy is a means to an end.

383
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,628
I'm aware of our final objective, general.

384
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:20,787
This is an important day for us.

385
00:35:21,398 --> 00:35:24,799
I need to make sure
that everyone knows his role.

386
00:35:25,169 --> 00:35:27,569
You could have told me all of this
on the telephone.

387
00:35:28,238 --> 00:35:32,299
Why did you take today of all days
to come down and berate me in person?

388
00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:36,572
Things have happened in the past few days
that have made me somewhat uneasy.

389
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:40,183
Today we got confirmation
that one of our targets is in Los Angeles.

390
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:45,687
That on top of the fact
that one of Lisa's bodyguards was killed.

391
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,416
I thought that was because
she was married to that Turk.

392
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:51,322
- That's the official story.
- What is the problem?

393
00:35:54,164 --> 00:35:55,256
Come on. Come on.

394
00:35:57,835 --> 00:36:00,167
- Do you have your card on you, Griffin?
- Of course.

395
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:01,668
I'd like to see it.

396
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:05,269
<i>- Where are we?
- Talk to me, Roland.</i>

397
00:36:05,442 --> 00:36:06,466
<i>Seventy-two percent.</i>

398
00:36:06,643 --> 00:36:09,840
- I put it in my safe this morning.
- I'd like to see it.

399
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:41,435
Eighty-six. Eighty-seven.

400
00:36:49,553 --> 00:36:51,111
<i>Ninety-two.</i>

401
00:36:52,222 --> 00:36:55,157
Fifteen years of working together,
you think you'd trust me.

402
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:58,158
Don't turn this into an opera.
Just hand me the card.

403
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,120
Come on. Come on.

404
00:37:14,678 --> 00:37:16,270
- Happy?
- From now on...

405
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:20,440
...l'm asking that everyone keep their card
on them at all times.

406
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:24,018
Anyone makes a move,
anything goes missing, you call me.

407
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:31,419
<i>- Did we get it?
- One hundred.</i>

408
00:37:31,595 --> 00:37:33,028
Yeah.

409
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:37,463
- I don't know how you eat that crap, Don.
- Yeah.

410
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:41,001
What was that called, tempeh?
Looked like you could barely choke it down.

411
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:44,834
- Yeah, well, it's an acquired taste.
- Excuse us.

412
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:50,004
Well, it looks like I should be getting back
to work. This was a pleasure.

413
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:15,262
Apparently billions in counterfeit currency
flooded the economy...

414
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:17,134
...which is what caused it all.

415
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:19,207
What I don't understand is why.

416
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:22,277
So far all the cardholders
have been experts in their fields.

417
00:38:22,446 --> 00:38:26,109
In energy, in logistics, in finance.

418
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,642
I mean, it looks like they're just trying
to tear the country up.

419
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,380
So they can profit by rebuilding it.

420
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,618
So the question is, what's next?

421
00:38:40,464 --> 00:38:41,556
I was at a bar earlier.

422
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:46,893
- Nothing happened, I didn't drink.
- Lf this is too much for you...

423
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,332
No, no.

424
00:38:48,505 --> 00:38:52,168
- Say the word, we'll scrap the whole thing.
- It's not gonna happen again.

425
00:38:52,342 --> 00:38:56,278
But it would be a lie
not to tell you...

426
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,610
...and I want you to know
that I'll never lie to you.

427
00:39:02,686 --> 00:39:03,778
I'm sorry.

428
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:20,033
Somebody's here for you.

429
00:39:20,704 --> 00:39:21,966
For me?

430
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,544
Cole Pfeiffer.

431
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,742
Is your name Xing?

432
00:39:35,652 --> 00:39:39,349
Mr. Xing stayed behind in New York.

433
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:43,786
Well, have a seat then.
What can I help you with?

434
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:51,191
You were supposed to deliver the item
two days ago.

435
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:52,699
Where is it?

436
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:55,963
- Where's what?
- I've traveled a long way, Mr. Pfeiffer.

437
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:57,800
My patience is wearing thin.

438
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:00,967
Playing games is not going to be good
for either of us.

439
00:40:01,144 --> 00:40:03,442
Scylla. Where is it?

440
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:10,750
- Mr. Pfeiffer...
- I'm at work. It's not like I can talk freely.

441
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:12,582
Just tell me the latest.

442
00:40:12,756 --> 00:40:16,385
The latest? If you deliver it to me
by the end of the day...

443
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,393
...I will pay you the sum
that we agreed upon.

444
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,089
As much as I'd like to tell you
that were possible...

445
00:40:22,265 --> 00:40:25,723
Give it to me by tomorrow
and you will receive 50 percent of your fee.

446
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:28,200
Two days, 25 percent.

447
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:31,000
Three days, I shoot you through the brain.

448
00:40:31,174 --> 00:40:33,904
That is the latest.

449
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:37,776
No problem.

450
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:11,843
I thought that urine
might be getting a little stale...

451
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:13,539
...so I brought you some more.

452
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:57,055
Hey, the image enhancement from the video
came back.

453
00:41:57,227 --> 00:42:00,025
- Did you get what I sent over?
- We got all three cardholders.

454
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:02,290
For the first two,
we have names, addresses...

455
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:04,593
...everything we need to grab them.

456
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:06,092
Sara.

457
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:17,174
But for the general, we got nothing.

458
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:18,405
<i>This guy's a ghost.</i>

459
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:24,446
You all right?

460
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:34,896
Look, most of what happened to me
in Panama is a total blank.

461
00:42:35,165 --> 00:42:38,225
When I was being held, I could hear
Gretchen talking on the phone.

462
00:42:38,401 --> 00:42:40,961
And she was taking orders
from the guy in charge...

463
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:42,765
...and she called him the general.

464
00:42:42,939 --> 00:42:46,773
- In charge of the mission?
- No, I think in charge of the Company.

465
00:42:51,548 --> 00:42:53,379
I told you...

466
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:57,513
...we should have killed Gretchen
when we had the chance.

467
00:42:58,722 --> 00:43:00,383
She'll come home.

468
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:04,354
- She always has.
- You'd better be sure about that.

469
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:08,289
- Excuse me, sir.
- What?

470
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:12,358
Someone at Homeland Security
did an enhanced image search on you.

471
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:15,630
- We couldn't tell where the original picture...
- Who?

472
00:43:15,806 --> 00:43:18,832
The guy who ordered it,
his name is Don Self.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
