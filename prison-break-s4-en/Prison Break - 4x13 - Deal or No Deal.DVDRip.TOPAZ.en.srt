<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:04,152 --> 00:00:05,312
This is Scylla.

3
00:00:05,486 --> 00:00:08,614
You're not even close
to getting out of here.

4
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:11,280
- Dad, it's me.
- Lisa?

5
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:13,086
I'm at gunpoint. It's Tancredi.

6
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:17,561
She says if you don't let Michael and
the others leave with Scylla, she'll kill me.

7
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:20,727
Don't move.

8
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:25,233
- I'm leaving.
- No, Mr. White.

9
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:30,842
- Turn around.
- Gentle, now, sugar.

10
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:33,810
That's "Special Agent Miriam Holtz"
to you, sugar.

11
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:35,710
- We have it.
- They got it.

12
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:38,909
I never thought you'd make it this far.
I was wrong.

13
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:40,144
What now?

14
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:44,018
This is all your transfer paperwork.
I need to get to Dallow ASAP.

15
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:48,923
- What happened to Gretchen?
- She got away.

16
00:00:56,604 --> 00:00:57,696
Self.

17
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:02,270
Self.

18
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:16,020
- He screwed us.
- Self can't do that.

19
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,454
He's government.
He can do what he pleases.

20
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:29,228
The vans are coming. They're just late.

21
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:32,497
- He ain't coming back.
- You don't know that, Linc. They're coming.

22
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,436
What do we do now?

23
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:39,379
Call Homeland.
See how much they know about Self.

24
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:46,915
- Stanton.
- Herb, it was Scofield and Burrows.

25
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:49,579
- Are you at the senator's office?
- Look, I'm shot.

26
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:51,651
<i>I'm shot.</i>

27
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:55,626
- Miriam's gone, okay?
- What's your position?

28
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:59,254
You were right
about this whole operation.

29
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:02,732
No. Burrows. Burrows!

30
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,131
Don. Don!

31
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,674
No, no, no.

32
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:12,103
I need to find Gretchen.

33
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:17,011
You gonna help me, or are you gonna
make me shoot you in the face?

34
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:18,811
Help.

35
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:22,889
<i>Department of Homeland Security.</i>

36
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:26,254
I'd like to talk to Don Self's superior,
please.

37
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:28,327
<i>One moment, please.</i>

38
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:31,894
We gave this guy
something worth $ 100 million.

39
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:34,193
Is he even with Homeland?
Did we see a badge?

40
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,598
We were given guns
and flown out on a C-130.

41
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:38,329
He didn't work for the DMV.

42
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:40,804
- That doesn't make him the law.
- No, it don't.

43
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:43,641
What if Homeland was in on this
from the beginning?

44
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:45,506
<i>This is Herb Stanton. Who is this?</i>

45
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:51,541
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

46
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,382
The way Self played this, no, no, no,
he kept himself too insulated.

47
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:59,185
That's why he hesitated with official
authorizations on behalf of our mission.

48
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,193
He kept saying
he didn't want the Company to find out.

49
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:05,127
It's because he didn't wanna get caught,
the son of a bitch.

50
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,359
He kept the circle tight
and left the rest of us holding the bag.

51
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,470
If Homeland knows where we're at,
sooner or later they're coming for us.

52
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:16,303
Let them come. We didn't
do anything wrong. We have deals.

53
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:20,277
No, we have paper. That's what Self left us.
We gotta get out of here.

54
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,746
We can't leave. Michael needs surgery.

55
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:28,521
I'm not talking about running.
I'm talking about surviving.

56
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:41,561
What I want is to see the Company
burn to the ground...

57
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:43,702
...and you in prison.

58
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:47,935
We did this to you.

59
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:50,241
We did this to you.

60
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,915
They're ready for you downstairs, sir.

61
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:14,627
Today marks a critical juncture
in our endeavor.

62
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:18,203
Do we have a bead on Scylla yet?

63
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:22,808
Our security, our future,
stands at a great precipice.

64
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:25,571
It's a yes-or-no question, Jonathan.

65
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:29,549
We don't need a soliloquy.

66
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:33,946
Howard,
why don't you wait in my office?

67
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:35,782
No.

68
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:40,916
I'm in here making sure
this operation isn't fumbled as well.

69
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,766
Out. Now.

70
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:47,958
What's your plan, Jonathan?

71
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:52,906
That's what we're all here for, right?

72
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:56,565
You tried to move Scylla
over our better judgment, and it backfired.

73
00:04:56,744 --> 00:04:58,405
So spill it.

74
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:25,000
Any further questions?

75
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:29,208
Very well. You have your assignments.

76
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:34,171
Access your assets
and retrieve Scylla today.

77
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:53,993
Yeah, well, a lot of people have believed
in me in the last few months, Agent Self.

78
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:56,136
Not all of them are alive today.

79
00:05:57,404 --> 00:06:01,135
I can't shake that line.
"All that avails is flight."

80
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:29,634
Come on.

81
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:45,276
Here, take that.

82
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,586
Sara's right.
We're need to get you to a hospital now.

83
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:54,589
We were so close to the finish line, Linc.

84
00:06:54,962 --> 00:06:58,898
- So close.
- Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know.

85
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,294
Listen...

86
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:03,334
...I spoke to L.J. Yesterday.

87
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:05,699
Told him this was almost over.

88
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:10,100
I'm keeping my word to my son, Michael.

89
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:16,382
- I should have seen this coming.
- No, no, it's no one's fault.

90
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,780
Self played all of us.

91
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:22,512
But we gotta get out of here.

92
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,920
This is our last option.

93
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:31,658
Yeah.

94
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:49,742
- Check upstairs.
- Clear.

95
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:52,108
It's clear.

96
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:54,582
- Got anything?
- Clear.

97
00:07:58,258 --> 00:07:59,520
Now we know where we stand.

98
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:02,290
Let's go.

99
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:07,525
Hello?

100
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:10,261
- Michael Scofield?
- Yes.

101
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:13,304
Herb Stanton,
Department of Homeland Security.

102
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:17,006
We wanna talk. Can you please come back
to the warehouse?

103
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:18,701
All right.

104
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,109
But first we're gonna need
some assurances.

105
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:24,876
- What kind of assurances?
- Look, we held up our end of the deal.

106
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:27,714
We're gonna need you
to honor the terms of our agreements.

107
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:29,788
<i>I'd have to look at those terms...</i>

108
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:32,824
...but I'm fairly certain
it didn't include stealing Scylla...

109
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:36,121
...or killing two federal agents
in cold blood.

110
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:38,062
What are you talking about?

111
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:40,996
Here are the new terms
I'm prepared to offer.

112
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:45,502
- Come back, turn yourselves in.
- Wait a minute, Self set us up.

113
00:08:45,673 --> 00:08:49,541
Don't and I'll hunt you down
like animals.

114
00:09:27,848 --> 00:09:28,872
We did what they said.

115
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:31,779
I ain't going down
on some trumped-up murder charge.

116
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:34,443
Self pinned two murders on us.

117
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:37,215
- What are you doing, Linc?
- Lf Homeland Security comes...

118
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:39,222
- Then we'll handle it.
- You know what?

119
00:09:39,393 --> 00:09:42,851
There's a point where you draw the line.
Now's the time to draw that line.

120
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,555
Don't be stupid.
You can't fight off Homeland Security.

121
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:48,998
Stupid is listening to the government.
I ain't going back to death row.

122
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:52,536
We can still hold on to our deals.
All we have to do is flush Self out...

123
00:09:52,706 --> 00:09:53,798
...prove he has Scylla.

124
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:56,772
- And how are we gonna do that?
- Devise another strategy.

125
00:09:56,944 --> 00:10:01,108
No, we should start devising a plan
that can get us across the Mexican border.

126
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,613
That's what we should do.
My cousin can hook us up.

127
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:05,376
We're not running.

128
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,851
I can't.

129
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,319
<i>Negative on Scofield,
Burrows and Mahone.</i>

130
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:13,221
TDZ think that Self
may be using a bakergrip...

131
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,088
...to mask his cell-phone signal.

132
00:10:15,496 --> 00:10:17,430
Place a tactical team around Homeland.

133
00:10:17,598 --> 00:10:19,862
If Self or any of those other bastards
show up...

134
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,593
...make well damn sure
they don't get near the building.

135
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,034
I can't go back
to living in and out of motels...

136
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:27,867
...constantly looking over my shoulder.

137
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:30,642
Nothing changes.
We take down the Company.

138
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:32,904
We finish what we started.

139
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:37,445
Who are you calling?

140
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:40,576
- The doctor.
- Sara, not now.

141
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:46,516
- When?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, listen.

142
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:50,857
<i>Cole Pfeiffer, an employee of GA TE,
a downtown wellness organization...</i>

143
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:54,091
<i>... and his yet-unidentified
female accomplice...</i>

144
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:56,168
<i>... both seen here in police sketches.</i>

145
00:10:56,637 --> 00:10:59,697
- And them?
- Gretchen.

146
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:02,036
Bagwell?

147
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:06,040
Have our people at DOT
monitor every traffic camera...

148
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:09,006
...from San Diego to the Bay Area.

149
00:11:12,786 --> 00:11:15,380
I can't believe you shot him.

150
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:19,859
Knowing when to sever a cancerous limb
to preserve the rest of the body...

151
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,154
He was one
of your most trusted advisors...

152
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:24,126
When I brought you in...

153
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:29,401
...I told you that a cardholder
has certain responsibilities.

154
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,472
If you can't handle
what we're doing here...

155
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,108
...it's time you let me know.

156
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:39,336
<i>- Gregory White,
who was shot and killed in the standoff.</i>

157
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:43,381
<i>Police are trying to determine
whether revenge or robbery was the motive.</i>

158
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:46,745
<i>Cole Pfeiffer was a recent addition
to the Los Angeles...</i>

159
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,218
Maybe we weren't
the only ones left hanging, huh?

160
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:52,118
If we're gonna flush Self out...

161
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:54,692
...how do you think he intended
to unload Scylla?

162
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,521
- Gretchen.
- He's gotta sell it.

163
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:04,330
Tell me when I'm getting warm.

164
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:07,003
You handpicked Michael Scofield
and the bunch...

165
00:12:07,174 --> 00:12:11,270
...trucked them all out here
on Uncle Sam's dime to do your bidding...

166
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:14,937
...and now they're standing
right in the cross hairs for what you did.

167
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,079
<i>I gotta hand it to you, Don,
if that ain't the Mona Lisa.</i>

168
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:26,122
I always said cops are more crooked
than criminals.

169
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:29,353
Let me guess, a little slice of heaven?
Is that what it was for?

170
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:32,025
Gambling debt?

171
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,967
Maybe you're a geologist
of the rock-candy variety?

172
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:40,436
The information you got
from Gretchen's prints.

173
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:42,871
- You sure it's the right address?
- Right as rain.

174
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:45,637
Good, now shut up
or I'm gonna shoot you.

175
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:48,044
You understand me? Shut your mouth.

176
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:49,477
- I ain't...
- Shut your mouth.

177
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,618
- I know when to shut...
- Be quiet.

178
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:01,984
How long does it take
to find a payphone in this city?

179
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:04,027
They'll be back.

180
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:06,323
Okay.

181
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:10,734
- Same deal as before.
- Yup.

182
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:13,566
No physical duress
for the next eight hours.

183
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,579
Here's the thing. You need help.

184
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:23,546
And running around
trying to track down Self isn't...

185
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:25,184
...safe.

186
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,354
You could be in Mexico in a few hours.
There are doctors there that I trust.

187
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:37,492
And you've been taking care of all of us.
I think it's okay if we take care of you.

188
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,931
Surgery or no surgery, I'm never gonna
be able to live with myself...

189
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:47,164
...unless I find a way
to take these people down.

190
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:52,168
It's that simple.

191
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:54,371
And I get it.

192
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:57,343
I'm not gonna demand
that you feel the same way.

193
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:07,084
We can't trust anyone.
Government, law enforcement.

194
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,718
- We should consider getting out of here.
- No, we deal with this now.

195
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:13,331
I want this guy as much as you,
but we're scrambling.

196
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,695
I don't know
how long Self's been planning this.

197
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:18,303
From the looks of it, it's pretty airtight.

198
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:49,862
- Gretchen.
- I hope you are calling...

199
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:52,130
...to tell me where Scylla is, Lincoln.

200
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:56,071
- You don't know?
- I don't know. What's going on?

201
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:58,507
Self double crossed us,
and he took Scylla.

202
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,280
You know where he could be?

203
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:05,378
If I'm Self, I'm looking for a new buyer.

204
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:07,884
A new buyer? You know what?

205
00:15:08,422 --> 00:15:11,016
If you're playing me,
I'm gonna split you in half.

206
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:16,254
Yeah. I want him just as badly as you do.
Where are you? I'm coming to you.

207
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,126
Grand Hope Park. One hour.

208
00:15:23,737 --> 00:15:26,035
- What?
- Sis.

209
00:15:27,074 --> 00:15:32,068
It's Emily. She's been in an accident.

210
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:35,237
Tell whoever's got that gun pointed at you
to grow a set...

211
00:15:35,415 --> 00:15:37,349
<i>... and get on the phone.</i>

212
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:42,412
She wants to talk to you.

213
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,285
What's up, Gretchen?

214
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:49,456
Time to come home now.

215
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:59,403
Are we really gonna
keep trusting that bitch?

216
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:03,475
Gretchen and T-Bag were waiting at GATE
with machine guns, guys.

217
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:05,634
You think they just wanted
to provide cover?

218
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:07,302
This chick's a mercenary.

219
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:09,745
She'll do whatever it takes
to get what she wants.

220
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,679
We just happen to want the same thing.

221
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,149
We are taking precautions...

222
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,118
...but one way or the other,
Gretchen's gonna get us to Self.

223
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:19,383
Right now that is all that matters.

224
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,151
We don't stand a chance.

225
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:23,626
Our photos aren't plastered
all over the TV.

226
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:27,324
Homeland's keeping it in-house.
We have a chance.

227
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,004
- Senator.
- Herb.

228
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:46,181
We sponsored this operation
with the best of intentions...

229
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:49,652
...but the secretive manner
in which we've handled it...

230
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:53,281
...I now fear is working against us.

231
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,621
- How so?
- We're in the middle of a manhunt...

232
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:58,355
...and it's just you
and a couple of agents out there...

233
00:16:58,532 --> 00:17:00,261
...trying to reign in these cons.

234
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,628
It's madness.

235
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,597
What we initially sponsored...

236
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:10,641
...didn't pan out.

237
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:13,736
That doesn't mean
that the boat is taking on water.

238
00:17:14,514 --> 00:17:16,345
No one knows.

239
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,744
That's the way it's going to stay.

240
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:23,313
Come in.

241
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:28,588
Good afternoon.
Richard Sooter, U.S. Marshals Service.

242
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:32,257
I've been sent at the request
of Deputy Director Esmar...

243
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:36,732
...to get to the bottom
of the Scofield-Burrows supermax story.

244
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:38,864
I'm hoping you gentlemen can help.

245
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:44,141
Guys, if there's a reason
you're keeping secrets, just fill me in here.

246
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:45,335
I can help.

247
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:49,246
How strong is your stomach?

248
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:51,441
Very.

249
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:55,415
Herb Stanton.

250
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:59,291
He's working with Donald Self.

251
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,321
We got a record of all incoming
and outgoing calls from Homeland today.

252
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:09,264
Stanton received a call
lasting approximately one minute...

253
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:12,103
...that was connected to no one.

254
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:16,205
- No one that we could identify.
- Self's phone.

255
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:19,539
DOT has a positive ID on Gretchen
from a traffic cam.

256
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:21,374
She's still in Los Angeles.

257
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:24,608
Chris is on the phone from Johannesburg,
looking for an update.

258
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:26,513
I'll call back.

259
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:30,317
Now, about this Mr. Stanton...

260
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:40,598
Alex, how are you doing?

261
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:43,999
No sign of Gretchen yet.

262
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:46,404
Linc?

263
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:50,274
<i>- No sign of Gretchen.
- Sucre?</i>

264
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:54,313
She ain't here yet, bro.

265
00:18:55,248 --> 00:18:56,340
Sara?

266
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:58,345
All clear.

267
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:01,180
All right, here we go.

268
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,507
That's far enough.

269
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:24,373
That's far enough.

270
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,713
I'm sorry, Rita.
I promise everything's gonna be okay.

271
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:37,789
Yeah, we're all friends here, Rita.
Don't worry about a thing.

272
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,790
You know, sending Feng after me
almost cost me my life.

273
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:50,959
And it did cost me my plan,
which is why you're here, Gretchen.

274
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:53,867
You're gonna help me find a new buyer
for Scylla.

275
00:19:57,577 --> 00:20:00,205
You been talking to Scofield
and the boys, huh?

276
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:03,012
Yeah.

277
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:05,310
- How are they?
- They're good and pissed.

278
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:07,112
Yeah? Where are they?

279
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:09,619
Gee, Don, I don't know.
I'm not their mother.

280
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:12,155
You're not their mother, but...

281
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,361
She looks just like you.

282
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:23,332
Doesn't she?
She's got those big blue eyes.

283
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:30,342
I'm supposed to meet them
in half an hour.

284
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:34,272
Get ready to phone in a tip to Homeland.

285
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:36,210
Where at?

286
00:20:36,383 --> 00:20:37,873
Where?

287
00:20:56,469 --> 00:20:59,199
To perform the operation,
that would require signatures...

288
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:01,237
...from 20 different department heads.

289
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:05,242
Now, the only way this is gonna work
is via freelancer, off the books.

290
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,911
I should be thanking you.

291
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:12,609
Because of what you've done,
lives are gonna be changed forever.

292
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:23,919
Scofield, you reconsider my offer?

293
00:21:24,097 --> 00:21:28,591
If I get you Self, if I can get you Scylla,
are you gonna be able to hold up our deals?

294
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,205
How do you intend doing that?

295
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,004
Well, that's what we're working on.

296
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:45,746
The feds, they're here.

297
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,943
We were set up.

298
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:19,808
Hands where I can see them, right now.

299
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:22,113
- Turn him around.
- Hands behind your back.

300
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:23,846
- Got him?
- Yeah.

301
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:26,491
- Right now.
- Up against the car. Up against the car.

302
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:40,633
Killing two federal agents ought to put you
back on top of death row, Mr. Burrows.

303
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:48,007
We didn't kill anyone. Self's behind this.

304
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:51,810
Don Self was a decorated agent
and an honorable man.

305
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:53,350
Yeah.

306
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,014
But you wouldn't be the first guy to sit in
that chair and try to sell me a bill of goods.

307
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:01,217
Why weren't we to Mexico
by the time you worked things out?

308
00:23:01,394 --> 00:23:04,557
- You slipped up.
- No, we were in the dark as much as you.

309
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:06,198
We know what happened, Burrows.

310
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:09,301
You're not putting this together.
Think how much Scylla's worth.

311
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:13,496
Think of the length's that Self went to
to keep this thing off the books.

312
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:16,608
And us, us, of all people...

313
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,702
...pulling this job off?

314
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:20,243
Where are the bodies?

315
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:24,349
For five minutes stop thinking about us
and focus on Self.

316
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:26,576
Why would we jeopardize our freedom?

317
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:30,245
It's the only thing
we've ever cared about.

318
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:41,094
- Where's Fernando?
- He's on his way.

319
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:44,065
I still have a friend in the bureau
we can reach out to.

320
00:23:44,237 --> 00:23:46,569
Maybe she can see
where they're holding Linc.

321
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:48,263
Who are you calling?

322
00:23:51,544 --> 00:23:54,308
- It's Scofield.
- All right, so answer it.

323
00:23:58,151 --> 00:24:00,551
I should've put a bullet in your face.

324
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,315
- I'm not the one who set you up, Michael.
- Yeah? Who did?

325
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:11,822
You know,
I meant what I said before, Michael.

326
00:24:11,998 --> 00:24:14,057
I like your style, okay?
You're a smart guy.

327
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:17,760
Unfortunately for you,
I'm just a little bit smarter.

328
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:19,427
Yeah, we'll see about that.

329
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:22,632
I heard Homeland made a surprise visit
to the plaza, huh?

330
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,868
Look, I'm gonna give you
some parting advice.

331
00:24:25,044 --> 00:24:28,810
Run, okay?
Get your pals and just start running.

332
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:30,574
We gotta go. Michael, we gotta go.

333
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,776
I appreciate all your help.
I'm gonna go sell Scylla now.

334
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:37,081
Don, you're not going anywhere.

335
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:38,848
Really? Okay.

336
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:41,391
- Who's the buyer?
- His name is Vikan.

337
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:44,530
- And he's not a buyer, he's a conduit.
- A conduit to what?

338
00:24:44,697 --> 00:24:48,189
We're not exactly moving heroin here.
It's a little bit more specialized.

339
00:24:48,368 --> 00:24:51,132
There's about five people
who know what to do with Scylla...

340
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:52,828
...and are willing to pay for it.

341
00:24:53,006 --> 00:24:56,601
All right, let's go.
And Bagwell's staying here.

342
00:24:58,778 --> 00:25:02,509
You will remain captive in my negativity
if you lay a hand on either one of them.

343
00:25:02,682 --> 00:25:04,809
I warned you not to screw me over.

344
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,982
How could you?

345
00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:15,057
I'll be back very, very soon.

346
00:25:15,228 --> 00:25:18,686
And I promise you
that that man is not gonna hurt you.

347
00:25:23,636 --> 00:25:25,831
How could you?

348
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,765
I'm gonna fix this.

349
00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:34,071
Wow, Gretchen,
you're making friends left and right, huh?

350
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:36,306
Now move your ass.

351
00:25:43,756 --> 00:25:45,053
We've accessed Self's EID...

352
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:48,216
...and have been able to get the files
he tried to delete.

353
00:25:48,394 --> 00:25:52,262
They're giving us a lot clearer a picture
of who he is and what he's been up to.

354
00:25:53,132 --> 00:25:54,429
Honorable, huh?

355
00:25:57,103 --> 00:25:58,400
What did you find out?

356
00:25:58,571 --> 00:26:01,039
A name, Robert Walker...

357
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:03,767
...the new identity
Self was planning on using.

358
00:26:03,943 --> 00:26:07,208
We found a Social Security number,
a bank account in the Caymans...

359
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,714
...credit cards, and a flight itinerary
out of the country for tomorrow morning.

360
00:26:13,753 --> 00:26:15,152
So first of all...

361
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:17,747
...we owe you an apology.

362
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:22,952
Second, when we get our hands on him,
it's gonna be paramount to get your help.

363
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:26,456
- How?
- Your testimony...

364
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:29,760
...and the testimony of your brother
and the others against Self...

365
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,404
...in exchange for full immunity.

366
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:34,938
- You walk away.
- We already had a deal.

367
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:37,872
If you walk now,
there will be no one left to tell the tale.

368
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:40,604
DHS needs you to cover its ass.

369
00:26:41,214 --> 00:26:43,546
We can't spend our time
chasing your friends.

370
00:26:43,716 --> 00:26:46,981
They need to come in
so we can work out the details.

371
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,579
What if they don't?
We got a whole bunch of trust issues.

372
00:26:51,758 --> 00:26:54,556
Then you'll all rot in a supermax prison.

373
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:59,790
DHS is prepared to fly
into the face of this thing or to bury it.

374
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:03,227
It's your choice, Mr. Burrows.

375
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:08,006
This is the best you're gonna do.

376
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:18,273
- Michael.
- Linc, where are you?

377
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:21,011
In the warehouse. Put me on speaker.

378
00:27:22,188 --> 00:27:24,986
<i>Homeland knows Self screwed us.</i>

379
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:26,819
What do we have?

380
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:28,961
They found a file he thought he deleted...

381
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:32,120
...with an international bank account
and one-way ticket out.

382
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:33,424
So it's over?

383
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:35,493
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

384
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:39,636
...if we testify against Self,
we get full immunity.

385
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:43,970
Immunity from what?
We did the job they hired us to do.

386
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:47,506
Michael, Senator Conrad Dallow.

387
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,671
<i>We have evidence
that supports your claims.</i>

388
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:52,682
I'm giving you're my word,
your troubles are over now.

389
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:55,650
Please come in so we can end this.

390
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,998
Okay, I've decided...

391
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:14,566
...or rather I think,
that we should hear the senator out.

392
00:28:15,341 --> 00:28:18,833
And if everything goes south,
then I do have a backup plan.

393
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:21,172
Go with Sara to the meeting
and get a lookout.

394
00:28:21,347 --> 00:28:23,611
Alex and I make sure
they don't bring surprises...

395
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:25,717
...by doubling back to the warehouse...

396
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:28,854
...and then following them
to the rendezvous.

397
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:31,785
This is where we're meeting the senator.

398
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,983
- All right?
- We'll be there.

399
00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:47,570
You know,
my father spent most of his political life...

400
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:50,440
...chasing justice.

401
00:28:51,577 --> 00:28:53,772
It was sort of an obsession.

402
00:28:54,614 --> 00:28:56,673
And my mother and I
could never understand...

403
00:28:56,849 --> 00:29:03,413
...why he would so easily
make other people's problems his own.

404
00:29:04,257 --> 00:29:06,623
And I think that's why she left him.

405
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:12,961
And, Michael, you remind me
more and more of him these days.

406
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:18,764
The way you put everybody else's problems
before your own.

407
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:23,908
That said...

408
00:29:25,444 --> 00:29:27,139
...I want you to know...

409
00:29:27,313 --> 00:29:32,410
...that if this meeting with Senator Dallow
doesn't go the way you want it to...

410
00:29:32,985 --> 00:29:35,579
...you don't have to worry
about you and I.

411
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:38,317
Nothing's...

412
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:42,627
Nothing's gonna come between us.

413
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:44,795
Yeah.

414
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:51,568
And everything is gonna be okay, right?

415
00:30:04,517 --> 00:30:06,576
You know, I figured it out.

416
00:30:07,553 --> 00:30:10,852
DHS wined and dined you in the beginning
and promised you the world...

417
00:30:11,023 --> 00:30:13,787
...and then they ultimately settled
on a broom closet...

418
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,124
...next to some schmuck from the FAA,
and you said no.

419
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:22,066
Gretchen,
you have a real keen sense of perception.

420
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:23,258
It's amazing.

421
00:30:23,436 --> 00:30:28,499
And this all ends
with a three-story hut in Tahiti, right?

422
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:31,939
Flat-screen TV, a couple Jet Skis outside.

423
00:30:32,345 --> 00:30:36,008
But what you're gonna find, Don,
is that when the rush is over...

424
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:40,346
...you're done patting yourself on the back,
and there's no one to tell the story to...

425
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,987
...you're gonna be just as alone
as you are now.

426
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:45,385
That's who Don Self is.

427
00:30:46,225 --> 00:30:49,126
- Is that right?
- You tell me.

428
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,835
- Yeah?
- Take out your gun.

429
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:08,646
- What's going on?
- You want your cut or not, Bagwell?

430
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:11,078
- Take out your gun.
- Relax, Don.

431
00:31:12,451 --> 00:31:13,816
All right.

432
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:15,248
Now point it at her head.

433
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:18,351
Don.

434
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,027
- Pull back the hammer.
- Don!

435
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:28,091
- Don.
- I want my money.

436
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:30,235
I wanna be on a plane
by the end of today.

437
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:33,895
Otherwise you and your family
are gonna find out who the real Self is.

438
00:31:34,073 --> 00:31:35,540
- It's him.
- Do you understand me?

439
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,266
We're set.

440
00:31:38,344 --> 00:31:41,438
Okay? That's him.

441
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,710
Please.

442
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,878
I'll call you back.

443
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,643
1714 East 7th Street.

444
00:32:14,814 --> 00:32:17,510
- This can't be right.
- You sure this is what he wrote down?

445
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:18,877
That's what it says.

446
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:22,949
It's a parking lot.
Why would Michael pick here?

447
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,190
I thought you were going
to the warehouse.

448
00:32:26,358 --> 00:32:27,825
Michael sent me ahead.

449
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:31,656
- What's going on? Where is he?
- He's safe. Michael's safe.

450
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:35,031
We're not gonna be able to do this alone.

451
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:37,863
He's doing what he has to do,
and we have to do our part.

452
00:32:38,037 --> 00:32:41,632
And right now that's getting on that bus
and getting out of the city.

453
00:32:44,143 --> 00:32:45,804
And we gotta go now.

454
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:51,011
He just wants you both to be safe.

455
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:55,452
- We gotta go. We really gotta go.
- Where's Michael?

456
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:11,827
Mr. Scofield, Herb Stanton.

457
00:33:12,004 --> 00:33:14,131
This is Senator Conrad Dallow.

458
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:16,831
On behalf of all Americans,
thank you for your service.

459
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:18,271
Save it.

460
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:22,471
I'm here to give my testimony,
and then I'm leaving with my brother.

461
00:33:23,082 --> 00:33:25,107
Right over here.

462
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:33,857
All right, gentlemen,
tell us what you know.

463
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:50,238
Are we really leaving?

464
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,842
You heard Mahone.
This is what Michael wants.

465
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,314
Right.

466
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:00,846
Okay, but if the deal with Dallow
is legit...

467
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,483
...there's no reason to run, right?

468
00:34:04,657 --> 00:34:08,525
Michael's just covering the bases,
making sure we don't run into trouble again.

469
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:12,687
Yes, but if he's in trouble,
he's going to need our help.

470
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,268
Well, maybe he thinks there's nothing left
for us to do.

471
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:31,382
If we leave now,
we're leaving him behind.

472
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:49,125
I didn't know Don Self had it in him.

473
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:53,237
Now that we know he's behind this,
our situation's a lot worse.

474
00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:57,808
We're not talking
about our careers anymore.

475
00:34:58,978 --> 00:35:01,344
We're talking about real jail time.

476
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:05,915
We get 15 years just for conducting
an unauthorized operation...

477
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:07,950
...without congressional approval.

478
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:11,082
Or not.

479
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:15,885
This doesn't have to be
about containment anymore.

480
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:20,329
It could be about excision.

481
00:35:24,403 --> 00:35:26,701
You all right with that, senator?

482
00:35:33,779 --> 00:35:35,770
Then they all go.

483
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:40,242
Where are the others?

484
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:43,286
- Mahone, Sucre, Tancredi.
- They're not coming.

485
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:47,482
Linc and I will testify, but the others...

486
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,322
Well, we all get immunity.
Those are the terms.

487
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:53,021
Our testimony alone will put Self away.

488
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:55,826
Gentlemen,
we can't have the others running around...

489
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:58,026
...while we're trying to wrap this up.

490
00:35:58,203 --> 00:36:00,831
I mean, can we call them?
Can we get them here?

491
00:36:01,006 --> 00:36:04,965
The deal was for all of you.
Those were the terms.

492
00:36:05,144 --> 00:36:06,941
Without everybody, there is no deal.

493
00:36:07,112 --> 00:36:09,376
Listen, pal,
you're gonna get what you want.

494
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:12,039
Are you gonna call them or not?

495
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,149
There never was a deal,
was there, senator?

496
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:24,652
I wish I could give you a better answer,
Michael.

497
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:31,294
Don Self left a lot of rough edges.
We have to smooth them out.

498
00:36:32,471 --> 00:36:34,871
You wanna tell me where they are?

499
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,234
It ain't gonna happen.

500
00:36:39,912 --> 00:36:43,404
I can get you Self.
I can still get you Scylla.

501
00:36:43,582 --> 00:36:46,983
Scylla? Oh, we're past Scylla.

502
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:52,554
Between getting it back
and ending this now, the choice is simple.

503
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:55,853
You wanted your supermax answer,
you got it, Richard.

504
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:57,723
Now time to go.

505
00:36:58,597 --> 00:37:00,929
Escort Mr. Sooter out.

506
00:37:09,742 --> 00:37:11,573
I'm gonna count to five.

507
00:37:13,178 --> 00:37:14,372
One...

508
00:37:15,314 --> 00:37:16,542
...two...

509
00:37:16,982 --> 00:37:18,040
...three...

510
00:37:33,298 --> 00:37:35,266
You've got an appointment
with the general.

511
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:55,012
There you go.

512
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:06,058
Wait right here.

513
00:38:33,258 --> 00:38:34,589
Been a long time, Gretchen.

514
00:38:35,494 --> 00:38:38,657
- No longer working for the general?
- Correct.

515
00:38:39,798 --> 00:38:42,824
- Who's he?
- I'm the guy that's holding Scylla.

516
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,127
You interested?

517
00:38:44,837 --> 00:38:49,035
Well, the general has offered a reward
for anyone who can return Scylla...

518
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:51,676
...along with the heads
of the transgressors.

519
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:56,173
I appreciate you
allowing me the opportunity...

520
00:38:56,348 --> 00:38:58,179
...to kick the general in the teeth.

521
00:38:59,218 --> 00:39:00,583
May I see it?

522
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:09,052
I said, move, move.

523
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:14,394
Long time coming, fellas.
You picked the wrong fight.

524
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:18,534
Let's see how well
you like your second term.

525
00:39:19,438 --> 00:39:20,962
Let's go.

526
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:24,406
All of you.

527
00:39:27,212 --> 00:39:31,239
- Sooter, please, I can give you cover...
- Save it. Save it. Save it, senator, save it.

528
00:39:32,251 --> 00:39:36,085
The general specifically asked
that I bring you in alive. Just move.

529
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:49,764
- You were gonna kill us, senator.
- It was Stanton who made that call.

530
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:55,203
What was extremely complicated
30 seconds ago is not so now.

531
00:39:55,374 --> 00:39:57,274
Six people knew about this operation.

532
00:39:57,442 --> 00:40:00,502
Two of them are still alive,
one is on the run, and I'm the other.

533
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,408
I'm not saying a word.

534
00:40:02,581 --> 00:40:06,108
You're not getting off that easy, senator.
You are going to help us.

535
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:13,988
There is a folder in that briefcase
on the conference table.

536
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,424
It contains the last remnants
of this operation.

537
00:40:17,796 --> 00:40:22,597
Once you dispose of it,
none of this ever existed.

538
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:24,861
That's the saving grace
of a covert operation.

539
00:40:25,037 --> 00:40:26,868
If you want...

540
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:30,166
...it never happened.

541
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,846
I'm gonna walk away now, catch a flight.

542
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:43,046
Maybe see my wife
before she goes to bed.

543
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,323
I only hope I don't catch a bullet in the back
on my way out.

544
00:40:50,662 --> 00:40:52,994
I'm really very sorry, gentlemen.

545
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,297
We tried.

546
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:02,730
We tried.

547
00:41:02,908 --> 00:41:06,776
Let him go. Linc, let him go. Don't.

548
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,280
Let him go.

549
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:18,445
We running now?

550
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:21,923
I will kill you myself
the next time you do something like that.

551
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:27,196
Where's Mahone?

552
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:29,700
He's gone.

553
00:41:43,682 --> 00:41:46,549
Well, we can do business
when you get the rest of Scylla.

554
00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:49,386
What are you talking about?

555
00:41:51,123 --> 00:41:55,287
- It's incomplete.
- Incom? Who is this clown?

556
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,052
- Clown?
- Yeah, clown.

557
00:41:58,163 --> 00:42:00,893
There's a piece missing, slick.

558
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,899
Look, here.

559
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,838
Hello, Don.

560
00:42:50,015 --> 00:42:52,916
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

561
00:42:55,954 --> 00:42:57,080
Come and get it.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
