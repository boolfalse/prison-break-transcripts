1
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,989
My name is Michael Scoldfield.

2
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:08,019
And I am a fugitive.

3
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:14,149
Three weeks ago, I was
in Panamanian Prison.

4
00:00:16,499 --> 00:00:19,369
I was there, I was
approached by the company.

5
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:25,888
The company is a corrupted orgnization.
Involved all levels of industry and government.

6
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:28,818
They gave me two options.

7
00:00:29,598 --> 00:00:32,818
Break one of their man
James Whistler, out of that prison.

8
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,798
Or they will kill the only
woman that I ever loved.

9
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:39,968
Doctor Sarah Tancredi.

10
00:00:42,328 --> 00:00:45,458
I held up my end of deal.
And I broke Whistler out.

11
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:51,708
But the comany, they
killed Sarah anyway.

12
00:00:55,677 --> 00:00:58,877
I dont know why the company want
James Whistler out of prison.

13
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:01,637
But I have tracked
him here to Los Angles.

14
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:05,697
He is with another company agent
that I only known as Gretchen.

15
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,207
The same agent who murdered Sarah.

16
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:14,477
This ends today.

17
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:18,127
I came here seeking justice.

18
00:01:18,297 --> 00:01:21,407
The justice I now know
the system can not provide.

19
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:26,186
So if you reading this letter,

20
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:29,096
You know I died revenging Sarah's death.

21
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:56,695
We drop it off in the racing
form, and we get the hell

22
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:57,955
Out of there.

23
00:01:58,115 --> 00:01:59,935
Who's the contact we're leaving it for?

24
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:02,825
The company wants the card back, period.

25
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:03,905
All you need to worry about

26
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,605
Is getting this rig the
hell out of there in a hurry.

27
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:07,035
Oh, I'll be getting it out of there.

28
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,415
Don't you worry about that.

29
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:11,985
You worry about getting your
ass back in that seat in time.

30
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:18,185
If you pull this off, you
can come up to my room later

31
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:20,235
And the word "no" won't
be in my vocabulary.

32
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:22,855
Just make sure we get paid.

33
00:02:58,004 --> 00:02:59,373
In and out.

34
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:46,382
Good to see you again.

35
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:47,502
You, too.

36
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:48,822
Didn't hear from you for a while.

37
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:50,302
Started to wonder if you
were still interested.

38
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:51,802
I am, very much so.

39
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:53,732
Well, I needed to
approach this carefully.

40
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:55,352
I'm sure you understand.

41
00:03:57,302 --> 00:03:58,722
Who you buying it for?

42
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:00,412
A competitor?

43
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:02,407
A foreign country? jason,

44
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,141
You know I can't get into that.

45
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:06,811
Now, we've been
negotiating this for months.

46
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:08,351
I've jumped through all your hoops.

47
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,571
I've agreed to meet you here.

48
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,221
Do you want to sell
the card to me or not?

49
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:29,351
Be right back.

50
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,610
That's a lot of secrets on
a little piece of plastic.

51
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,780
Let me give you a little bit of advice-

52
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,070
And this is on the house-

53
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,820
Watch your step with that thing.

54
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,410
The company will do
anything to get it back.

55
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,800
Don't I know it.

56
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:31,179
Yeah.
What the hell are you doing?

57
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,180
We got to get out of here.

58
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,149
I need to hide the gun.

59
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:35,939
Take the gun with you!

60
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:47,939
Come on!

61
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:50,688
Where is she?

62
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,188
Michael, you don't understand.

63
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:57,968
Call gretchen, get her in here now.

64
00:05:58,048 --> 00:05:59,398
You have to trust me.

65
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:01,218
I'm not your enemy, michael.

66
00:06:01,268 --> 00:06:02,498
James.

67
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:06,898
We need to leave.

68
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:08,658
You know, despite everything...

69
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:10,697
If sara could weigh in right now,

70
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:11,887
She'd tell me not to kill you.

71
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:13,877
That's the kind
of person she was.

72
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,027
That's the kind of
person you took from me.

73
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,167
James,

74
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,667
Didn't you tell him?

75
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:20,877
He walked in five... shut up!

76
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:23,187
Gretchen, look at me.

77
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:25,377
This is for sara.

78
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:26,657
I never killed sara.

79
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:29,577
I wouldn't expect someone like
you to take this with dignity.

80
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:32,407
I swear to god she's alive.

81
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:35,577
Don't insult me and don't insult her.

82
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:36,607
She escaped.

83
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:38,727
We knew if you found out we
wouldn't have any leverage.

84
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:40,617
I fabricated the whole thing.

85
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:42,746
My brother saw...
A head in a box!

86
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:43,996
From a cadaver.

87
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,106
You ask lincoln what he really saw.

88
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:48,046
Listen to her, michael.
Don't lie to me.

89
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:49,426
I'm not lying to you. lincoln bought it,

90
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:50,616
You bought it, it worked.

91
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:54,796
Michael.

92
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,316
Then where is she?

93
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:58,326
I'll tell you when we get outside.

94
00:06:58,486 --> 00:06:59,256
Right now,

95
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,096
We need to get out of here.

96
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:02,486
They found the bodies.

97
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:06,666
Give me the gun.
She's lying.

98
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,776
Is she?

99
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:09,556
If you pull that trigger,
you'll never know.

100
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:11,806
Kill him, james.

101
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:12,626
Shut up.

102
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:13,805
Where is she?

103
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:15,215
Where is sara?!

104
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:16,485
Michael,

105
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:18,735
If you don't give me that gun,

106
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:20,765
I'm going to shoot you in the head.

107
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:34,495
Let's go.

108
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:40,115
We got a double homicide
at the roosevelt hotel.

109
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:01,814
Sara.

110
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:25,608
Do you know the difference

111
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:28,427
between a perfectly
executed operation

112
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:30,214
and a failed mission?

113
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,648
Sir?
- It's small unit leadership.

114
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,474
The Allies spent
two and a half years

115
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:37,519
planning the
invasion of Normandy,

116
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,444
but on D-Day it came
down to a handful of men

117
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:41,757
on a strip of beach

118
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,169
to decide the fate of the world.

119
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,293
What I'm getting at, Gretchen,

120
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:48,933
is even the best
plan is only as good

121
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:51,781
as the moving parts on
the ground executing it.

122
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:54,034
General, we got your card--
what's the problem?

123
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:55,851
We have nothing.

124
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,263
It's a duplicate.

125
00:08:58,302 --> 00:08:59,652
Almost flawless,

126
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:00,982
but a duplicate.

127
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:01,975
That's impossible.

128
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:02,967
- I saw...
- You know

129
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:04,754
how important the
retrieval of this card

130
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:06,501
is to me, Gretchen.

131
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,327
You know that this
is a security breach

132
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:11,602
that could have
catastrophic ramifications

133
00:09:11,632 --> 00:09:12,525
for the Company.

134
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:14,739
The only thing I can think of...

135
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,199
There was a blind spot

136
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:17,748
When whistler was hitting the target.

137
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:21,166
Maybe he made a duplicate
and he still has the original.

138
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,855
You hired him.

139
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:25,513
You kept him at the tip of the spear.

140
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,831
You insisted that we
get him out of sona.

141
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:29,590
We had to.

142
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,688
He had already made
contact with the target.

143
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:33,847
At that point, it was
him or no one, sir.

144
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,654
What's your stake in all of this?

145
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,833
I had nothing to do with it.

146
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:40,472
Whistler acted on his own.

147
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:41,771
I swear to you.

148
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,749
General, I can fix this.

149
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,788
You trained me.

150
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:48,966
Not well enough, apparently.

151
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:53,464
You know what to do.

152
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,629
Please.

153
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,288
I have a bank account in dubai

154
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,387
Left over from a slush
fund from cobra ii.

155
00:10:02,397 --> 00:10:03,296
It's yours.

156
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:04,705
No, please, please...

157
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:14,008
Hello.

158
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:15,907
Hey, it's me.

159
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:17,376
Where are you, man?

160
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:18,765
Los angeles.

161
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:19,934
You okay, michael?

162
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:21,823
No, I'm, I'm safe.

163
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,081
Thank god, thank god.

164
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:26,010
How's LJ and sofia?

165
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,099
Yeah, they're, um...

166
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:29,917
I'm staring at them right now in fact.

167
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:30,907
They're fine.

168
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:33,035
You hear about sona?

169
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,244
What about it?

170
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:35,763
Burned down three days back.

171
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:37,252
The inmates - they rioted.

172
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,091
No sign of bellick,

173
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:39,600
T-bag, or sucre.

174
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,720
Sucre?

175
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,528
He got popped,
I don't know how.

176
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:44,407
I mean, the papers listed
the names of the inmates,

177
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,326
And he was in there when it went down.

178
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,493
I found whistler and gretchen...

179
00:10:50,403 --> 00:10:53,381
And, uh...

180
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,129
...gretchen said...

181
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:59,327
...she said sara is still alive.

182
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:04,473
What did you see, linc?

183
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:06,002
What do you mean what
did I see, michael?

184
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:08,470
I need you to tell me
exactly what you saw.

185
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,399
Michael, sara's gone.

186
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:12,947
Well, you said it was in a garage, right?
So it was dark.

187
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:14,606
Yeah, it was dark.

188
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:19,213
But if you're asking me
if I picked up the head

189
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:22,600
To check to see if it was
sara, no, michael, i-i...

190
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,139
LJ said he...

191
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:28,216
He only heard them kill sara, right?

192
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:29,955
You just got to come back, please.

193
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,664
Come back. let's just...

194
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:33,422
Let's just start a new life.

195
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:35,561
Tell sofia I said hi.

196
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:36,870
And tell LJ...

197
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,608
Tell him his uncle loves him.

198
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:41,527
Michael, don't do this, please.

199
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:05,210
Out, out!

200
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,068
You need some better
ventilation back there, amigo.

201
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:09,607
Want to translate that?

202
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:10,536
Don't worry about it.

203
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:11,626
Gracias.

204
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:16,282
Where's your mom?

205
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:17,142
She'll be here.

206
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:18,331
What do you mean she'll be here?

207
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:19,630
We're-we're running out of time.

208
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,029
I got to be up there.
Don't worry.

209
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,448
My mom wouldn't let me down.

210
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:26,425
At least, she hasn't yet.

211
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:28,574
Bradley!

212
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:29,823
Over here!

213
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,382
Mom! mom! here!

214
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:34,080
I told you! don't worry,
you'll make it there!

215
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:44,672
What is it called?

216
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:47,101
Europeangoldfinch.net.

217
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,599
It's what we can all use to communicate.

218
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:20,307
Michael.

219
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:27,902
Don't worry, I'm alone.

220
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:30,200
It's good to see you.

221
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,659
So where's your new best friend?

222
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,556
I don't know about that,

223
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,175
But whistler's not who you think he is.

224
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:40,383
We're working together

225
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:41,642
Against the company.

226
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:42,771
Yeah?
Yeah.

227
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,440
And what about gretchen?

228
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,939
She working with you?

229
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,417
He needed her to further his plan.

230
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,736
Look, if the guy was company,
he'd have shot you dead

231
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,415
Back at that conference
like she wanted him to.

232
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:54,863
Do you have any information
about sara or not?

233
00:13:57,931 --> 00:13:59,390
Let's go somewhere a
little more private.

234
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,078
I want you to tell me right now.

235
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:03,816
I want you to tell me
right now, right here!

236
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:05,295
Or we can get gretchen on the phone.

237
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:06,515
Gretchen's dead.

238
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,203
She never showed up.

239
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,442
Come and talk to me, please.

240
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:19,136
Whistler and I were at that
conference to get a data card.

241
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,484
It's like the company's black book.

242
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:25,451
And it lists all their
agents, all their operations.

243
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:26,540
They refer to it as

244
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,279
"scylla."

245
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:29,578
Whistler's got it.

246
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:31,137
Alex, talk to me about sara.

247
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:32,366
That's all I care about.

248
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:33,875
I understand that. I want nothing more

249
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,744
Than to get home to my wife and my son.

250
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:38,652
But that's not gonna
happen for either of us

251
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:40,271
With the company out
there trying to kill us.

252
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:41,930
You don't know anything
about sara, do you?

253
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,799
Whistler does.

254
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:43,968
He tells me he does.

255
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:45,757
And he wants to tell you.

256
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:48,155
But he wants something in return.

257
00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:49,934
What? What does he want from me?

258
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,103
To talk to you.

259
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,163
I'm sorry about all
that the other night.

260
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:06,992
If I had more time, I would've
explained myself better.

261
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:07,881
Sure.

262
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:09,190
What are we doing here?

263
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,419
Alex told you about scylla?
Yes.

264
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,708
I have it.

265
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:15,746
There's one last step involved
in order to read the data.

266
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:18,434
And that step involves breaking
into a secured structure.

267
00:15:18,454 --> 00:15:20,053
So now you need my help.

268
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,892
Yeah.

269
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:22,631
My book, the bird book, the one I lost

270
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:23,960
In sona contained information

271
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,619
That would've helped
facilitate the break-in,

272
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,288
But it can still be accomplished,

273
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:29,036
With your help.

274
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:30,266
Where's sara?

275
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:33,763
The only thing I know for sure,

276
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,371
A week ago, some information

277
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:37,650
Came through the wire.

278
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,448
Sara may have bought a
bus ticket in santa fe.

279
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,588
Headed where?

280
00:15:42,137 --> 00:15:43,226
Chicago.

281
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,845
Michael, if sara's out there,

282
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:46,654
she's not safe, none of us are.

283
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:47,743
The company knows we still have

284
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:49,152
The original card, and that's why

285
00:15:49,162 --> 00:15:50,531
Gretchen was the first to go.

286
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:52,660
I think we're done here.

287
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,898
Michael, we... have a chance for once

288
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,935
To get scylla to people that
want to take the company down.

289
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:03,052
I don't want to run anymore.
We won't have to run anymore.

290
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:05,601
I spent the last month
thinking sara was dead

291
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:07,180
And that it was my fault.

292
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:09,248
If she's out there, I'm gonna find her.

293
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:10,797
That's all I care about.

294
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,156
This can be done within a week.

295
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,175
Less.

296
00:16:13,645 --> 00:16:15,644
At least let me show you...

297
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:57,227
Oh, I'm gonna miss
these game, girl.

298
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:58,226
Don't go.

299
00:16:59,822 --> 00:17:02,318
This ain't no home for
a white boy from Alabama.

300
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:04,775
They're here, signor.

301
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:05,774
The bags are packed.

302
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:22,443
You kept your word to me.

303
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:26,227
You're the first that's
ever done that. gracias.

304
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:30,899
Why must you go after this man?

305
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:32,855
You could choose not to.

306
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,970
Where I come from, there's
something called a blood feud.

307
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,508
Comprende?

308
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:38,686
Yes.

309
00:17:38,695 --> 00:17:40,213
Michael scofield left me for dead

310
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:42,219
One too many times, as it turns out.

311
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:46,233
What is spanish for "little angel"?

312
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:47,470
Angelita.

313
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:53,320
Adios,angelita.

314
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:02,824
Is this legit?

315
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:03,911
Si, signor.

316
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:07,875
For the money you're paying,
first class, all the way.

317
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,020
So these are coyotes one could trust.

318
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:12,019
Si, signor.

319
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:14,304
Vamanos.

320
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:38,812
As you've seen,

321
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:42,316
What you're entering
into is quite serious.

322
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:43,994
I realize that.

323
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:46,120
You're responsible for this now.

324
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,815
You have nothing to worry about.

325
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,022
We'll talk soon.

326
00:18:55,654 --> 00:18:57,281
It's time to clean up now.

327
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,607
Thoroughly.

328
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:02,791
Everyone who was close to Whistler:

329
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,089
Scofield,

330
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,613
Mahone, Burrows.

331
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:09,600
Burrows is still in panama.

332
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:11,407
Clean up.

333
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:24,604
Hello.

334
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:26,171
Hi, pam.

335
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:30,075
Where...

336
00:19:30,274 --> 00:19:31,502
Where are you?

337
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:33,189
Uh, you know.

338
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,214
In the middle of it, as usual.

339
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,091
Panama still?

340
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:40,057
No.

341
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:41,415
Are you okay?

342
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:43,202
Definitely.

343
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:46,087
Are you?

344
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:48,004
Yes.

345
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:49,821
And cameron?

346
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:52,546
He's fine.

347
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:54,892
I have to tell you, pam, you know,

348
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:59,574
I had a plan for all
of us to be together.

349
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:01,241
And...

350
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,915
I'm not gonna stop working on it.

351
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:09,237
Why do you need a plan if
you want to be with someone?

352
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:11,773
You just be with them.

353
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,435
Don't say that unless you mean it.

354
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:19,999
'cause I'll turn this world
upside down to get back to you.

355
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,704
So don't say it unless you mean it.

356
00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:25,290
I mean it.

357
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:28,974
Okay.

358
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:33,256
Come on, babe.

359
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,684
I hate plantains, you know that.

360
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:36,361
I try your chili burger.

361
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:39,006
Chili-chili burger? you
loved the chili burger.

362
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:41,732
Okay, I'm gonna make them
with my mom's special recipe.

363
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:42,990
Your mom's special recipe?

364
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,058
You'll love it.

365
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:44,886
Really?

366
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:46,983
Yeah!
You're gonna love it, trust me.

367
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,988
It's delicious.

368
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:54,969
Let's get out of here. Drop 'em.

369
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:56,606
Let's go. Give me your hand. LJ.

370
00:20:57,414 --> 00:20:58,413
Let's go.

371
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:00,709
Lincoln?
Yeah, come with me.

372
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:02,955
Lincoln, what's going on?

373
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:07,028
Dad.
We're safe now.

374
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:08,356
Relax.
No.

375
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,544
I saw someone.

376
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:11,551
Looks like company, I'm sure of it.

377
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,587
Let's just go, okay?

378
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:14,945
Let's go.

379
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,928
We'll-we'll be fine.

380
00:21:18,938 --> 00:21:20,495
All right, all right.
Yeah.

381
00:21:25,597 --> 00:21:26,585
Okay.

382
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:27,633
Let's go.

383
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:28,981
Get back.

384
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:42,917
Dad!

385
00:21:51,702 --> 00:21:53,069
Dad, we have to run.

386
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:55,555
Go. Get out of here.

387
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,023
Run!

388
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:20,542
I'm looking for alex.

389
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,328
I don't know where he is.

390
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:26,372
No?

391
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:27,381
No.

392
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:29,467
Uh, we've been divorced
for almost two years now.

393
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:31,434
We haven't had contact in months.

394
00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:35,527
I would think that might change
now that he's back in the US.

395
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:39,979
I am so sick of you people-
what are you a fed?

396
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:42,225
Thinking that you can
keep on harassing...

397
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,812
I'm not with the government, pam.

398
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,937
Mom, could you come here?

399
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:50,291
We're done talking...

400
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,407
Bruce bennett.

401
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:34,955
Do you know who this is?

402
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,698
I do.

403
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:41,983
I'm looking for sara, and right now,

404
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:44,139
You're the only person I
can think of who can help me.

405
00:23:45,347 --> 00:23:46,455
Hold on.

406
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:57,606
Where are you?

407
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:59,024
Back in chicago.

408
00:23:59,632 --> 00:24:01,190
Have you heard from her?

409
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,326
Meet me in front of the
drake hotel in a half hour.

410
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:06,441
Please just tell me... is she alive?

411
00:24:09,426 --> 00:24:10,664
Are you michael scofield?

412
00:24:13,848 --> 00:24:15,276
Are you michael scofield?

413
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,856
Yes, I am.

414
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:22,493
Hands on your head.

415
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,547
Michael scofield.

416
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:41,191
Special agent don self,
homeland security.

417
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,286
Were you there when
james whistler was killed?

418
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:45,873
I didn't kill him.

419
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:47,401
I know you didn't.

420
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:50,935
He was an independent contractor

421
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:54,239
Who worked for the company
for about ten years.

422
00:24:54,478 --> 00:24:57,972
He was assigned to retrieve
scylla once it went missing.

423
00:25:01,037 --> 00:25:02,674
Do you know what scylla is?

424
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:04,292
It's the company's little black book.

425
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:07,716
So he was going to make a
copy of it and give it to me.

426
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:09,083
What do you want from me?

427
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,449
You're looking at major time.

428
00:25:12,068 --> 00:25:13,406
You know that, right?

429
00:25:15,043 --> 00:25:17,868
So how would you like to
walk away from it all...

430
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,815
Not do a day?

431
00:25:19,825 --> 00:25:21,862
In exchange for...?
Scylla.

432
00:25:23,928 --> 00:25:28,001
All right. sara tancredi,
last seen in panama,

433
00:25:28,949 --> 00:25:30,357
If you help me find her,

434
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:31,755
Maybe we've got a deal.

435
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:33,871
I'm sorry, she's not my
department, scylla is.

436
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:35,378
Then go find it yourself.

437
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:36,576
It seems to me,

438
00:25:36,586 --> 00:25:38,064
The US government should
have a little more reach

439
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:40,220
Than someone who's
looking at major time.

440
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,586
To perform the operation, michael,

441
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:43,664
That would require signatures

442
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:45,980
From about 20 different
department heads.

443
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,965
Do you want to bet at least
one of them is company?

444
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:51,311
The only way this is going to work

445
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:53,637
Is via freelancer, off the books.

446
00:25:53,647 --> 00:25:55,154
It sounds complicated.

447
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,602
I'll take a pass.

448
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:59,697
I'm giving you an opportunity
to avoid 15 years in jail,

449
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:02,083
Not to mention the time
that your brother's facing.

450
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,570
What are you talking about?

451
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,116
The company tried to
take him out in panama.

452
00:26:06,126 --> 00:26:09,270
He, um... reacted,

453
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:11,007
Apparently.

454
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:12,894
But I just made a deal

455
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,641
With the panamanian authorities

456
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:15,929
For him to serve out
his time in the US

457
00:26:15,939 --> 00:26:17,686
He should be touching
ground any time now.

458
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:25,692
You recognize this handwriting?

459
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:28,877
This is your father's.

460
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:30,873
He spent the last two years

461
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:32,850
Of his life going after this very thing.

462
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:42,603
Do you believe in fate, michael?

463
00:26:43,631 --> 00:26:45,418
I think I'd like to talk to my brother.

464
00:26:58,346 --> 00:26:59,424
Oh, no.

465
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,923
What's going...?

466
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:12,961
Stop! Stop!
Hey! you don't want to go in there.

467
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:14,528
You don't want to go in there.

468
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:19,820
I'm sorry.

469
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,618
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,622
God, she's...

471
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,427
Lilah maria sucre.

472
00:27:51,615 --> 00:27:53,292
She gave her my name?

473
00:27:56,816 --> 00:27:58,084
Soy tu papa.

474
00:28:09,774 --> 00:28:10,992
You're setting me up?

475
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:14,236
Sucre, you can't keep
bringing maricruz down.

476
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:16,362
You can't do this to her anymore.

477
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,038
It's ok.

478
00:28:19,637 --> 00:28:21,344
Wait. Don't...

479
00:28:21,454 --> 00:28:22,652
Sucre, don't...

480
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:25,656
Go! Go!

481
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:27,034
Oh, boy.

482
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:38,185
We're screwed.

483
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:43,246
You know why scofield

484
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:45,253
Gets all twisted up when he's around me?

485
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:48,637
We're the same, and
he just can't stand it.

486
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:50,783
Drives his ass crazy.

487
00:28:51,103 --> 00:28:53,429
We got the same brilliant mind,

488
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:55,246
The same natural-born leader tendency,

489
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:58,680
The same one-in-a-million-type
charisma, yes?

490
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:01,066
He just gonna look down his nose at me?

491
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,631
How you gonna find him?

492
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:06,766
This.

493
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,603
You're both into birds?

494
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:10,020
No, no.

495
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,596
It's either gonna take
me to him, or he to me.

496
00:29:13,914 --> 00:29:14,982
I just know it.

497
00:29:14,992 --> 00:29:17,078
If I was you, I'd forget
about this scofield.

498
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,304
You have plenty of money.
See? I mean...

499
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:21,002
How much money you have in that bag?

500
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,937
Why don't you just mind
your own beeswax, huh?

501
00:29:25,184 --> 00:29:26,412
You just keep pointing

502
00:29:26,422 --> 00:29:28,658
This jalopy northbound, all right?

503
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:30,945
Get me back to the land 'o cotton.

504
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:32,662
Of course.

505
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,139
Ready.

506
00:29:55,283 --> 00:29:57,599
Only a few people in government
will know of the operation.

507
00:29:57,609 --> 00:29:58,817
It has to stay that way,

508
00:29:58,827 --> 00:30:01,622
Or people's lives will be
in danger, mine included.

509
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:03,389
Taking down the company
sounds a little bigger

510
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:04,796
Than a two-man job, no?

511
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:06,324
I'm going to get you help.

512
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:08,011
I thought you said, you
couldn't trust anybody.

513
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:09,419
Yeah, but maybe you can.

514
00:30:09,638 --> 00:30:11,355
All right, two of your cohorts-

515
00:30:11,365 --> 00:30:14,490
Fernando sucre, and brad
bellick were arrested,

516
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,708
They're both facing time,

517
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:19,042
And alexander mahone is
in a colorado jail cell.

518
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:20,180
Good, let him sit there.

519
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,346
You're going to need mahone if
you want to make this happen.

520
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:24,253
He was working with whistler.

521
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:25,581
And you'll have me.

522
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,617
Okay? Whatever you need, I'll provide.

523
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:30,153
Whistler also said something
about a second step,

524
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:31,720
Something about a break-in.

525
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,496
Yeah, the card has all the data on it,

526
00:30:34,506 --> 00:30:35,833
But it's encrypted.

527
00:30:35,973 --> 00:30:37,291
Once you get your hands on it,

528
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:38,628
You're going to need
to find a way to break

529
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:39,956
Into the company's headquarters.

530
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:42,023
It's the only way to
unlock what's on the card.

531
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:43,011
Where's the building?

532
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:44,918
L.A.
Where in L.A.?

533
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:45,736
I don't know.

534
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:47,953
So, we've got a data card,
which could be anywhere,

535
00:30:48,132 --> 00:30:49,600
And we've got to break into a building,

536
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,526
The location of which
has yet to be determined.

537
00:30:51,636 --> 00:30:52,694
Simple enough.

538
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:54,781
You've broken out of two penitentiaries.

539
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:57,746
I'm thinking, uh,
breaking into a building

540
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,662
Isn't too far outside your wheelhouse.

541
00:30:59,752 --> 00:31:01,020
How do you know our dad?

542
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:04,304
He heard from contacts
that I could be trusted.

543
00:31:05,103 --> 00:31:06,391
Your father was a good man.

544
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:07,459
Why now?

545
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:10,594
Look, I've been going after
the company for five years.

546
00:31:10,604 --> 00:31:12,970
Okay? When whistler
was killed yesterday,

547
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,645
The plug was going to be
pulled on the entire operation.

548
00:31:16,094 --> 00:31:17,322
But, uh...

549
00:31:17,332 --> 00:31:20,427
I convinced my superiors
to give it one more chance.

550
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:22,433
So this is like job security for you?

551
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:23,871
What's that?

552
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:26,596
Well, when we go out
there and risk our necks,

553
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:27,335
You can collect your pension.

554
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:28,643
No, no, no, lincoln.

555
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,510
Okay, some people still
care about their job.

556
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,987
Some people still
fight for this country.

557
00:31:31,997 --> 00:31:33,574
Maybe you've been a
little too distracted

558
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:36,010
Boosting car stereos and breaking heads

559
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,288
To remember that.

560
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:48,569
I don't know. if we do this deal,

561
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:49,806
After it's done,

562
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:54,968
You can look for sara... if she's alive.

563
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:57,024
If we take this deal, we'll both be dead

564
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:59,101
Long before I get the chance, linc.

565
00:32:06,578 --> 00:32:08,654
You guys must have
some big-time friends.

566
00:32:08,854 --> 00:32:10,132
What are you talking about?

567
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,529
Somebody just posted

568
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:13,286
A significant amount
of bail for both of you.

569
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:14,225
Who?

570
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:16,111
I don't know, but they're outside.

571
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,447
You're free to go.

572
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:22,151
Here, take your dad's
file. My number's inside.

573
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:24,108
We ain't doing this.
Just take it anyway.

574
00:32:24,118 --> 00:32:26,274
This file, it means
nothing to me anymore.

575
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:45,341
Bruce bennett.

576
00:32:49,145 --> 00:32:50,532
Let's go for a drive.

577
00:34:03,068 --> 00:34:04,805
I thought I'd never see you again.

578
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,869
I have something for you.

579
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:37,559
Okay.

580
00:34:42,271 --> 00:34:44,108
You left this behind.

581
00:34:49,828 --> 00:34:51,136
Is that what this is about?

582
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:53,292
You just getting me my rose back?

583
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:54,789
Yeah. I guess I'm done now.

584
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:55,957
I can retire.

585
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,827
How much time are you looking at?

586
00:35:05,261 --> 00:35:06,659
They're saying 15 years.

587
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:09,734
I have to find out for sure.

588
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,847
I heard lincoln say
something about a deal.

589
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,684
No jail time.

590
00:35:16,392 --> 00:35:18,888
In exchange for taking down the company.

591
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:21,773
How?

592
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,648
Exactly.

593
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,917
I love you.

594
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:33,603
That's all I know right now.

595
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,086
"will you not yield
to the immortal gods?"

596
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,670
"that nightmare cannot die."

597
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,257
"eternal evil itself."

598
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:03,152
"there is no fighting her, no."

599
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:05,428
"No power that can fight her."

600
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:08,573
Now, listen to me,
it's up to you now.

601
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,017
"all that avails is flight."

602
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,643
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

603
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,279
I'm sorry.

604
00:36:40,648 --> 00:36:42,215
Do you want to talk about it?

605
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:13,382
It's not your fault.

606
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,658
It's not.

607
00:37:18,004 --> 00:37:19,272
Tell me what happened.

608
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,328
It's just the company.

609
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:29,554
It's just what they do.

610
00:37:30,922 --> 00:37:32,110
It wasn't just me.

611
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,957
God, it was you and LJ and-and

612
00:37:33,966 --> 00:37:35,134
Lincoln.

613
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:39,687
And they won't stop,

614
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:43,211
And I don't know how to deal with that.

615
00:37:44,988 --> 00:37:46,235
Hey, come here.

616
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,871
Come here. come here.

617
00:37:57,915 --> 00:37:58,974
Let's go!

618
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:18,021
Are you okay?

619
00:38:19,149 --> 00:38:20,946
I can't believe they found us so fast.

620
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:22,833
Should I call... should I call bruce

621
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,300
And-and get some place safe?

622
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,967
No place is safe.

623
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:28,493
They're not gonna stop
unless we stop them. linc?

624
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:31,049
You thinking what I'm
thinking? let's end this.

625
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,836
But I'm not gonna
leave you behind again.

626
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:41,870
Yeah?

627
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:42,869
We're in.

628
00:38:51,544 --> 00:38:52,422
Hey

629
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:53,580
Hey, papi.

630
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:56,874
Linc.

631
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,357
I can't tell you how grateful
I am for you including me.

632
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,353
Well, sucre vouched for you, bellick.

633
00:39:03,363 --> 00:39:04,961
He said you came through

634
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,129
For him down in panama.

635
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:08,385
Alex?

636
00:39:09,253 --> 00:39:10,331
Michael.

637
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,238
You ready for this?

638
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,265
Yeah. I am.

639
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:19,016
So I hear whistler's bird book has
details about what we need to steal.

640
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:19,905
Yeah.

641
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:21,452
You know who's got it, right?

642
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:25,795
Please.

643
00:39:26,194 --> 00:39:27,642
We'll die out here.

644
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:30,167
Thanks for the cash, gringo.

645
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,914
First class all the way.

646
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,411
Do we have any idea where t-bag is?

647
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,109
That snake could be anywhere.

648
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,065
When we're in L.A., we
can think like convicts,

649
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:44,573
We just can't act like them.

650
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,130
If we do, we're done.

651
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,098
It goes without saying-

652
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:48,476
This is your last chance to back out,

653
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,724
'cause first on the list of things

654
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:53,098
I cannot guarantee you is your safety.

655
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:56,951
We're all a long way

656
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,559
From where this started.

657
00:39:58,569 --> 00:40:00,316
But what I can guarantee you

658
00:40:00,326 --> 00:40:02,272
Is that if we do this thing right,

659
00:40:02,492 --> 00:40:04,379
We'll be close to where it ends.

660
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:06,725
Freedom.

661
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:08,911
Finally.

662
00:40:11,756 --> 00:40:13,922
You two,
let's go.

663
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:18,185
Hey, mike?

664
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:20,541
What about sara?

665
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,273
Sara's in.

666
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:32,900
All right, we're heading out tomorrow.

667
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,445
I have to finalize a
few things before we go.

668
00:40:36,214 --> 00:40:38,570
No games and no stunts.

669
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,878
Otherwise, I promise,

670
00:40:39,888 --> 00:40:42,024
You're gonna see a whole
different side of me.

671
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:43,462
Likewise.

672
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,279
Fake ids.

673
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:47,944
It's a good start,

674
00:40:48,922 --> 00:40:50,739
But there are some
things you can't fake,

675
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:52,606
And there are some things

676
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:54,962
You can't hide.

677
00:40:57,078 --> 00:40:58,356
Know what I mean?

678
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:02,379
How high is your threshold for pain?

679
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,277
You sure you don't want a sedative?

680
00:41:12,672 --> 00:41:14,219
We're gonna go into the night.

681
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,208
How do you feel?

682
00:41:38,717 --> 00:41:40,823
Lighter somehow.

683
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:42,580
Look, I don't know how
we're gonna take them down.

684
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,688
I don't even know who they are,

685
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:45,256
But I do know one thing-

686
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:49,369
The company's gonna pay
for what they did to you.

687
00:41:51,056 --> 00:41:52,254
Let's go.

688
00:41:52,693 --> 00:41:54,150
You sure you're up for this?

689
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:59,102
If we can do it together,
um... yeah.

690
00:41:59,103 --> 00:42:00,101
Ok.

691
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,608
Absolutely.

692
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:09,574
A c-130? What do they want...

693
00:42:09,584 --> 00:42:11,441
Want us to parachute out of this thing?

694
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:14,316
This guy called in a
favor to the air force.

695
00:42:14,715 --> 00:42:16,941
It's not like we can be
flying commercial, you know?

696
00:42:20,615 --> 00:42:22,662
If you're successful
with obtaining scylla,

697
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:26,076
You'll not only avoid jail time,
but you can take great pride

698
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,402
In knowing you helped dismantle
this country's greatest threat

699
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,069
To its own democracy.

700
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,235
If you're killed while doing so,

701
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:34,491
A proper funeral will be provided.

702
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,967
But if you try to escape,

703
00:42:36,977 --> 00:42:38,784
You will have no funeral.

704
00:42:38,994 --> 00:42:40,251
You will have nothing,

705
00:42:40,261 --> 00:42:41,998
And you will be
apprehended and buried where

706
00:42:42,008 --> 00:42:42,707
We find you.

707
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:46,700
I sincerely hope we
understand each other.

708
00:42:49,755 --> 00:42:51,842
You better hold up your end of the deal.

709
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,678
Let's go!

710
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:13,000
  

711
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:17,647
They are in projection
you asked for general

712
00:43:30,745 --> 00:43:32,199
you clear, go ahead

713
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,934
there has been a complication

714
00:43:34,255 --> 00:43:36,241
burrows and scofield had transferred to...

715
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:38,196
I read the newspapers,

716
00:43:38,427 --> 00:43:40,703
you don't have to tell
me what's in the headlines

717
00:43:41,436 --> 00:43:44,354
the exact penitary where they
are been held is under disclosed.

718
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:46,721
But you can guarantee
the federal...

719
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:49,790
...supermax.
No more updates.

720
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,746
Call me when they are dead.

721
00:43:53,982 --> 00:43:56,885
Welcome to Los angeles. As it turns out,

722
00:43:56,886 --> 00:44:01,995
Men who have escaped not one,but two penitaries
are considered as a bit of fight risks.

723
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:03,540
So we need to know where you are

724
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,104
and what you're doing at all times.

725
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:06,649
These are GPS ankle monitors.

726
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,885
Now step up, take one and put it on.

727
00:44:08,915 --> 00:44:10,821
I ain't wearing that.

728
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:12,827
Let's make this clear

729
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:14,171
I'm your ally,

730
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:16,337
but more importantly, I'm your boss.

731
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:17,681
Which means if this fails-

732
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:20,018
it's my ass on the line
as much, if not more,

733
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:21,793
than yours, so from this point on,

734
00:44:21,823 --> 00:44:24,430
if I ask you to do something, you do it.

735
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:25,965
If I ask you to say something,

736
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:26,908
you say it.

737
00:44:26,938 --> 00:44:28,813
And if I ask you to put on a monitor-

738
00:44:28,843 --> 00:44:30,618
you put on a monitor.

739
00:44:50,907 --> 00:44:53,244
As far as the general
public is concerned,

740
00:44:53,284 --> 00:44:55,992
you're being contained in a
supermax facility somewhere

741
00:44:56,022 --> 00:44:57,356
in the United States.

742
00:44:57,396 --> 00:44:59,262
So to avoid any messy explanations

743
00:44:59,302 --> 00:45:00,565
and stay off the Company's radar-

744
00:45:00,605 --> 00:45:01,638
you need to keep

745
00:45:01,669 --> 00:45:05,249
your heads down and your ears open.

746
00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:08,087
We've provided cell phones,
clothing, and toiletries-

747
00:45:08,127 --> 00:45:10,163
all the basic necessities
to get you up and running.

748
00:45:11,236 --> 00:45:12,299
you-you patted these guys down

749
00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:13,673
before you let them in, right?

750
00:45:13,703 --> 00:45:15,108
'Cause I can't be getting
shanked or shivved.

751
00:45:15,148 --> 00:45:16,110
Who's this?

752
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:18,317
This is Roland Glenn.

753
00:45:18,357 --> 00:45:19,390
He'll be assisting you.

754
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,593
We've already got our team.

755
00:45:20,624 --> 00:45:23,071
No, Scofield, see, this is my team,

756
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:24,033
And Roland's working off

757
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:25,377
a sentence just like the rest of you.

758
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:27,012
In fact, with the amount of security

759
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:28,346
that's gonna be around Scylla,

760
00:45:28,386 --> 00:45:30,492
Roland's expertise will be a necessity.

761
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:32,558
So, if no more questions,

762
00:45:32,598 --> 00:45:34,032
let's get to work on finding Scylla.

763
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:35,166
What about that second step?

764
00:45:35,206 --> 00:45:36,540
What about the break-in?

765
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,014
You let me worry about step two, okay?

766
00:45:38,044 --> 00:45:39,478
You just worry about finding Scylla.

767
00:45:39,518 --> 00:45:41,153
I've got an idea where to start.

768
00:45:42,286 --> 00:45:43,590
That's excellent, Alexander.

769
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,064
See, there's a man who's thinking.

770
00:45:45,095 --> 00:45:47,602
All right, let's let these

771
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:48,605
men get to work.

772
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:50,079
Good luck.

773
00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:52,085
To all of us.

774
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:55,725
since I was here first I think I'll

775
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:57,972
just go ahead and
grab that S.S. bedroom,

776
00:45:58,002 --> 00:45:58,905
if that's cool.

777
00:45:58,935 --> 00:46:01,211
Sara...
Yeah?

778
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:03,418
...you take the bunk.

779
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:07,961
You know, when this is,
when this is all done-

780
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:11,271
you and me, we're gonna settle up.

781
00:46:16,787 --> 00:46:18,090
All right, obviously,

782
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,537
there's a lot of history in this room.

783
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:21,901
That's a given.

784
00:46:21,942 --> 00:46:23,005
But it we're gonna pull this off,

785
00:46:23,045 --> 00:46:24,950
it's gonna take all of us.

786
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,184
We got to work together.

787
00:46:26,214 --> 00:46:28,521
So if anyone has a
problem, get it out now.

788
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:30,496
You want to clear the
air with someone...

789
00:46:30,526 --> 00:46:33,375
now's the time.

790
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:42,932
All right.

791
00:46:42,963 --> 00:46:44,437
Let's get to work.

792
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:47,115
Whistler's assignment was to drop off

793
00:46:47,145 --> 00:46:48,719
this, this, this data card-

794
00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:50,956
th-this 'Scylla' to
a Company Executive.

795
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:53,132
Someone he referred
to as "The Cardholder."

796
00:46:53,162 --> 00:46:55,399
And his job was to-to protect it.

797
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:57,806
To... keep it safe.

798
00:46:57,846 --> 00:46:59,210
Now, I didn't

799
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,590
see who he was, but I
got a look at his driver.

800
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,693
His driver?

801
00:47:03,723 --> 00:47:05,327
You want to sketch this guy's face

802
00:47:05,368 --> 00:47:07,905
and match it up to 10
million people in Los Angeles?

803
00:47:07,935 --> 00:47:09,510
Well, that's just great.

804
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,084
I saw more than just the guy's face.

805
00:47:11,114 --> 00:47:13,351
All the drivers were
hanging around, talking shop,

806
00:47:13,391 --> 00:47:15,256
but this guy, he was
standing by himself.

807
00:47:15,296 --> 00:47:16,700
Legs apart, hands behind his back,

808
00:47:16,731 --> 00:47:18,566
at rest he's former military.

809
00:47:18,606 --> 00:47:19,840
His car

810
00:47:19,907 --> 00:47:21,250
rides a little lower
than the rest of 'em.

811
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,954
Probably signifies private security.

812
00:47:23,984 --> 00:47:25,987
Weighed down by bulletproof siding.

813
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:27,490
His suit, his suit-

814
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,992
you don't buy a suit like that

815
00:47:29,022 --> 00:47:30,394
on a cop's salary or pulling

816
00:47:30,424 --> 00:47:31,896
weekend gigs as a driver.

817
00:47:31,926 --> 00:47:33,469
That means he's full-time.

818
00:47:33,499 --> 00:47:34,530
He's highly paid.

819
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,073
You ask our friend

820
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,236
Mr. Self to run tax records

821
00:47:38,276 --> 00:47:40,710
on the 45- to
55-year-old white males

822
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,284
in Los Angeles drawing
a military pension,

823
00:47:43,314 --> 00:47:46,318
and taking six figures from
a private security company,

824
00:47:46,348 --> 00:47:50,054
and you narrow your field
from 10 million till about 50.

825
00:47:50,094 --> 00:47:52,127
And then I can pick
the guy out from there.

826
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,135
Find the driver, you
find the Cardholder.

827
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:19,699
We haven't ate or
drank anything for days.

828
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:21,843
Oh, I don't want

829
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:23,846
to die out here.
We ain't gonna die, Sancho.

830
00:48:25,378 --> 00:48:27,281
Hey, hey, we ain't gonna die.

831
00:48:27,311 --> 00:48:28,353
Okay. We just gotta find

832
00:48:28,383 --> 00:48:30,356
what's called a compass cactus.

833
00:48:30,386 --> 00:48:33,190
Due to the fact it always
leans toward the south.

834
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,093
Inside there's delicious fruit
which'll fill our bellies.

835
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:37,867
Plus, we find out which way is south,

836
00:48:37,897 --> 00:48:39,670
we're gonna find out which way is north.

837
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,633
Comprende?

838
00:48:43,706 --> 00:48:45,379
Tell you what.

839
00:48:45,409 --> 00:48:49,044
Why don't we, uh, rest
here for a while, huh?

840
00:48:49,084 --> 00:48:51,518
Travel at night when it's cooler.

841
00:48:51,548 --> 00:48:53,792
Si. That sounds good.

842
00:48:56,656 --> 00:48:58,699
What are we gonna do when we get there?

843
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:00,532
To San Diego.

844
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,134
You mean after Michael pays

845
00:49:02,164 --> 00:49:04,338
for the vile he's transgressed upon me?

846
00:49:08,614 --> 00:49:11,018
I'm still trying to figure that out.

847
00:50:16,548 --> 00:50:18,651
Nice to work with Homeland.

848
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:21,986
The FBI would take days
to gather this intel.

849
00:50:22,026 --> 00:50:23,228
Well, the FBI should'a hired me

850
00:50:23,258 --> 00:50:24,931
'cause I could've gotten
whatever info you wanted

851
00:50:24,961 --> 00:50:26,133
in 25 minutes tops.

852
00:50:26,163 --> 00:50:27,435
You some kind of hacker?

853
00:50:27,465 --> 00:50:29,968
I design silicon lithography
for personal gain.

854
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:31,341
He's an identity thief.

855
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:32,673
He's a douche.

856
00:50:32,703 --> 00:50:34,145
Hey, why don't you sit in the corner

857
00:50:34,175 --> 00:50:35,547
and we'll get you when we need you.

858
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,612
This is him.

859
00:50:38,652 --> 00:50:41,386
That's the driver.

860
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:42,518
Now what?

861
00:50:42,558 --> 00:50:44,461
Well, he takes us to the Cardholder,

862
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:47,265
and the Cardholder takes us to Scylla.

863
00:50:54,205 --> 00:50:56,880
You could have left me there, in jail.

864
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,542
Could have or should have?

865
00:50:58,582 --> 00:51:00,115
Maybe both.

866
00:51:00,145 --> 00:51:01,647
Are you thanking me, Alex?

867
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:03,219
I don't know.
Don't bother.

868
00:51:03,249 --> 00:51:05,222
You're here because we needed you.

869
00:51:05,252 --> 00:51:06,995
Not because we wanted you.
That's him.

870
00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:09,429
That's the guy.

871
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:22,719
What's that, private security?

872
00:51:25,453 --> 00:51:27,657
It's like a fortress.

873
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,733
Slow down. Slow down.

874
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:33,195
This thing we gotta get,

875
00:51:33,235 --> 00:51:34,938
it's in there?

876
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,845
Motion sensors, alarm systems,

877
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,708
armed guards.

878
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:44,813
In and out of that place

879
00:51:44,853 --> 00:51:46,886
without anybody knowing.

880
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:49,690
You better have one
hell of a plan, Michael.

881
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:53,666
So, basically, there's no
freaking way to break in

882
00:51:53,696 --> 00:51:54,998
to the place.
Not quickly.

883
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,571
Not without being seen.

884
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:58,804
What about the neighbors,
uh, somewhere we can be staged

885
00:51:58,834 --> 00:52:00,477
from, you know, go under and up?

886
00:52:00,507 --> 00:52:03,511
Closest neighbor is
here, across the street.

887
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:06,045
And even that would take weeks.

888
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:07,387
The government's story

889
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:09,050
about us being held in a supermax

890
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,853
will only last so long.

891
00:52:10,893 --> 00:52:12,195
What does that mean? I mean,

892
00:52:12,225 --> 00:52:14,398
then what if somebody
finds out we're not.

893
00:52:14,428 --> 00:52:15,900
What if we don't have
to be in the house?

894
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:17,002
If the cd-ar

895
00:52:17,032 --> 00:52:18,204
this Scylla
- is so important

896
00:52:18,234 --> 00:52:19,806
maybe the guy is carrying it on him.

897
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,269
Well, according to
public records, the owner

898
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:22,571
of the estate's name is Stuart Tuxhorn,

899
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:26,316
and he's a CEO of a
company called Spectroleum.

900
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:28,850
Heavy hitter like that's
gonna have security 24-7.

901
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,882
And we gotta get this thing

902
00:52:29,922 --> 00:52:31,224
Without anyone knowing it's gone, right?

903
00:52:31,254 --> 00:52:33,427
So even if he's got it on
him, how do we get it off him?

904
00:52:33,457 --> 00:52:34,859
You don't steal the card.

905
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:36,332
You copy it.

906
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,544
Oh, now you're interested
in what I gotta say, right?

907
00:52:46,307 --> 00:52:48,150
Copying it will make it harder.

908
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,452
Not only do you have to steal it,

909
00:52:49,482 --> 00:52:50,653
you have to return it, genius.

910
00:52:50,683 --> 00:52:54,559
Only if you don't got me, hombre.

911
00:52:55,621 --> 00:52:56,593
What's that?

912
00:52:56,665 --> 00:52:58,952
This is the reason I got busted.

913
00:52:58,992 --> 00:53:00,185
Oh, you stole the cell phone?

914
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:01,537
Oh, yeah, yeah, no,

915
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:02,830
I'm lookin' at federal
time 'cause I stole

916
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,162
a cell phone
- seriously?

917
00:53:04,192 --> 00:53:05,852
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

918
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:06,847
I invented this

919
00:53:06,877 --> 00:53:08,398
so that I don't have to steal.

920
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:11,619
It looks like a cell
phone but it's really like

921
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:12,872
a digital black hole.

922
00:53:12,912 --> 00:53:15,428
Wireless hard drive that
swallows up any electronic data

923
00:53:15,457 --> 00:53:16,551
within ten feet of it.

924
00:53:16,591 --> 00:53:17,615
Like what?

925
00:53:17,645 --> 00:53:18,878
Like the account info

926
00:53:18,908 --> 00:53:21,423
of anyone at Starbucks
with a latte and a laptop.

927
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:24,446
Like the PIN number of any
credit card used at a gas pump.

928
00:53:24,476 --> 00:53:26,494
I can walk out of here
and get the identities

929
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:28,423
and financial statements of
ten people in ten minutes,

930
00:53:28,453 --> 00:53:29,646
On a slow day,

931
00:53:29,676 --> 00:53:30,939
with one hand on my junk.

932
00:53:32,162 --> 00:53:34,190
And the information embedded in Scylla?

933
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,472
If we can get close enough...

934
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:38,467
It's ours.

935
00:53:52,222 --> 00:53:57,142
Is this number... acceptable to you?

936
00:54:01,303 --> 00:54:03,129
10,000 people?

937
00:54:12,251 --> 00:54:14,805
- Yes.
-Good.

938
00:54:14,845 --> 00:54:16,242
Now that you're on board,

939
00:54:16,272 --> 00:54:18,997
we can issue the op-order today.

940
00:54:28,248 --> 00:54:29,475
He's on his way.

941
00:54:29,515 --> 00:54:31,641
All right, hold on.

942
00:54:34,664 --> 00:54:35,902
Sara, it's me.

943
00:54:35,932 --> 00:54:37,199
Everybody's on.

944
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:38,597
OK.

945
00:54:39,155 --> 00:54:40,492
Now, while I'm monitoring the device,

946
00:54:40,522 --> 00:54:41,650
I'm not gonna be able to see

947
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:42,718
exactly what data's being copied.

948
00:54:42,748 --> 00:54:44,185
But, like downloading

949
00:54:44,215 --> 00:54:46,709
quality porn from the Internet,
progress bar's gonna tell me

950
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:48,137
when it's time to rock and roll.

951
00:54:48,176 --> 00:54:49,873
How long do they need to stay in range?

952
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:52,667
Encrypted data like this is
gonna take at least two minutes.

953
00:54:52,697 --> 00:54:54,324
Here he comes.

954
00:54:54,364 --> 00:54:56,090
Sucre, you're on.

955
00:55:08,065 --> 00:55:09,632
Good luck.

956
00:55:13,724 --> 00:55:15,450
Easy.

957
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,847
Huh?!

958
00:55:16,877 --> 00:55:18,713
Sir, would you mind stepping
away from the vehicle?

959
00:55:19,711 --> 00:55:21,268
Talk to me, Roland.

960
00:55:21,308 --> 00:55:22,506
I got nothing, man.

961
00:55:22,536 --> 00:55:24,232
Last time I had this
little action, I was

962
00:55:24,262 --> 00:55:25,759
dry humping my way through fifth grade.

963
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:28,094
Calm down.

964
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:31,248
Sir...

965
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:32,744
Step away from the vehicle!

966
00:55:32,784 --> 00:55:35,539
Okay, bro, just relax,
we don't have to get all excited.

967
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:36,676
You speak English now.

968
00:55:36,706 --> 00:55:38,303
Only a little, but, uh...

969
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:40,429
How about now?

970
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:41,466
Nada.

971
00:55:41,496 --> 00:55:42,993
Try to get closer to them.

972
00:55:43,023 --> 00:55:45,618
If he was any closer,
he'd be in the car.

973
00:55:47,115 --> 00:55:48,512
I get your little act, Pedro.

974
00:55:48,552 --> 00:55:49,779
Hit the brakes,

975
00:55:49,809 --> 00:55:52,304
let the rich guy pay for
damage you don't intend to fix.

976
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,795
Just give the man some money

977
00:55:56,835 --> 00:55:58,132
So we can leave.

978
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,118
Congratulations.

979
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:14,857
He was there.
I think Tuxhorn was in the car.

980
00:56:14,897 --> 00:56:16,953
So did we get it or not?
Nope.

981
00:56:16,993 --> 00:56:18,290
Nothing.

982
00:56:30,196 --> 00:56:32,890
Can I help you?

983
00:56:34,587 --> 00:56:36,453
So how did you find me?

984
00:56:36,483 --> 00:56:38,109
I never lost you.

985
00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:40,704
The, uh, the new nose
threw me a bit, but...

986
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:42,470
What do you want, Don?

987
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,868
I got customers.

988
00:56:43,898 --> 00:56:47,131
Look, back in the days, when
you worked with the Company...

989
00:56:47,161 --> 00:56:48,159
Well, for the Company.

990
00:56:48,189 --> 00:56:49,656
I did economic forecasts
of their operations.

991
00:56:49,686 --> 00:56:51,422
I mean, I wasn't one of the guys...

992
00:56:51,452 --> 00:56:52,420
But you had access.

993
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,047
Come on,
the last time I helped you,

994
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,514
the only thing I got out of it

995
00:56:55,543 --> 00:56:57,869
was plastic surgery
and a $100,000 pay cut.

996
00:56:57,909 --> 00:56:58,936
You know, so either you buy

997
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:00,104
one of these exceptional family cars,

998
00:57:00,134 --> 00:57:01,801
with above average gas mileage,

999
00:57:01,831 --> 00:57:03,557
or you leave me the hell alone.

1000
00:57:03,597 --> 00:57:04,894
I know about Scylla

1001
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:08,846
And I'm going after it.

1002
00:57:10,044 --> 00:57:12,139
You know, I knew you were crazy.

1003
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,606
I didn't know you were stupid, too.

1004
00:57:13,636 --> 00:57:16,271
Well, let's just say I was
able to get hands on it.

1005
00:57:16,301 --> 00:57:18,197
It's my understanding that
Scylla could only be used

1006
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,093
if it's plugged into a decoder box

1007
00:57:20,123 --> 00:57:21,719
that's hidden in one of
the Company facilities.

1008
00:57:21,759 --> 00:57:22,757
Am I right?

1009
00:57:22,787 --> 00:57:24,214
You know, I wish I could help,

1010
00:57:24,254 --> 00:57:25,611
but I can't.

1011
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:26,949
No, you are helping, Jasper.

1012
00:57:26,979 --> 00:57:29,543
Just a matter of whether
you do it before or after

1013
00:57:29,573 --> 00:57:31,599
I shame you in front
of your coworkers here.

1014
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:38,884
Tell me where the Company
keeps the box, Jasper.

1015
00:57:38,924 --> 00:57:39,952
Could be anywhere; I don't know.

1016
00:57:39,982 --> 00:57:41,479
Somebody does.

1017
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:42,477
Right?

1018
00:57:42,517 --> 00:57:44,612
Somebody that you might
have access to.

1019
00:57:44,642 --> 00:57:46,009
You know, if you go down this road,

1020
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:47,806
your government job won't protect you.

1021
00:57:47,836 --> 00:57:50,560
Then I bet not get caught, right?

1022
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,254
If I don't find something to eat soon,

1023
00:57:53,294 --> 00:57:55,390
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1024
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,687
We're not gonna make it.

1025
00:57:57,146 --> 00:57:59,781
we just got to keep...
keep talking, Sancho.

1026
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:02,236
Keep our brains focused
on something other than

1027
00:58:02,276 --> 00:58:05,299
our empty bellies and
our dry mouths, okay?

1028
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:06,567
Come on.

1029
00:58:06,597 --> 00:58:09,461
Let's start with, uh,
your-your favorite color.

1030
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,444
Hell you doing?!

1031
00:58:18,672 --> 00:58:19,800
I'm hungry, Teddy.

1032
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,137
Why should the both of us die

1033
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:22,264
out here when one of us

1034
00:58:22,294 --> 00:58:23,592
could help the other one survive?

1035
00:58:23,632 --> 00:58:26,087
You don't want to do this. Please.

1036
00:58:26,126 --> 00:58:28,282
I'll make it quick. I promise!

1037
00:58:31,944 --> 00:58:34,310
Sancho.

1038
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,125
Sancho!

1039
00:58:41,155 --> 00:58:45,417
Why'd you have to go
and do something so...

1040
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,306
So Tuxhorn doesn't keep the card on him.

1041
00:59:24,336 --> 00:59:25,564
It must be in there, right?

1042
00:59:28,957 --> 00:59:30,294
Look, there's no way we're getting

1043
00:59:30,324 --> 00:59:31,851
in that house without being seen.

1044
00:59:31,891 --> 00:59:33,288
I know.

1045
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:35,513
Well, if the card's in
there, how we gonna copy it?

1046
00:59:35,543 --> 00:59:36,481
We're not.

1047
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:39,405
She's gonna do it for us.

1048
00:59:53,476 --> 00:59:56,799
What you reading?

1049
00:59:56,839 --> 00:59:58,735
"There is no fighting her.

1050
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:00,462
"No power can fight her.

1051
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:03,585
All that avails is flight."

1052
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:05,382
Thatomer.

1053
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:06,679
That's from The Odyssey.

1054
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:08,675
Is this from my father's folder?
Yeah.

1055
01:00:08,715 --> 01:00:10,910
And it explains why
Scylla sounded so familiar.

1056
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,904
If I'm not mistaken, it's
from that chapter in the book

1057
01:00:13,934 --> 01:00:14,932
where Odysseus is told

1058
01:00:14,962 --> 01:00:17,127
he has to confront a monster

1059
01:00:17,157 --> 01:00:19,622
known as Scylla.

1060
01:00:19,652 --> 01:00:21,788
Wonder why he wrote this down.

1061
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,614
I could be wrong, but I believe

1062
01:00:23,644 --> 01:00:26,179
Odysseus is told that in order to

1063
01:00:26,209 --> 01:00:28,334
continue on his path, to pass Scylla,

1064
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:31,328
it'll require the
sacrifice of six of his men.

1065
01:00:31,368 --> 01:00:34,262
His only other alternative
is to abandon his path.

1066
01:00:34,292 --> 01:00:37,954
And he chooses to make the sacrifice.

1067
01:00:37,984 --> 01:00:41,477
Well, it's a hell of a choice.

1068
01:00:44,401 --> 01:00:45,469
One I'm not sure

1069
01:00:45,499 --> 01:00:47,065
I'm comfortable making.

1070
01:00:49,989 --> 01:00:54,550
Sara, um, about tomorrow,
the plan,

1071
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:55,549
housekeeper...

1072
01:00:57,344 --> 01:00:58,642
If you're not up to it...

1073
01:00:58,671 --> 01:01:00,707
No, no, I am.

1074
01:01:11,445 --> 01:01:13,182
Tell me,

1075
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:17,133
is Claudia Mauricio a good roommate?

1076
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:26,484
A good person?

1077
01:01:28,709 --> 01:01:32,601
I hope she feels the same about you.

1078
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,757
Oh, Shelby, you wouldn't believe

1079
01:01:39,787 --> 01:01:42,421
the traffic on the...

1080
01:01:42,451 --> 01:01:44,976
You'll want to be quiet now,

1081
01:01:45,016 --> 01:01:46,642
Claudia.

1082
01:01:46,672 --> 01:01:48,209
There are levels of clearance

1083
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:49,666
at the Department of Corrections

1084
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,131
that are simply not available,

1085
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:54,396
even for friends as connected as mine.

1086
01:01:54,426 --> 01:01:57,420
So, listen carefully,

1087
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:01,781
if you even remotely
value your friend's life.

1088
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:05,903
You're going to use your
security code to access

1089
01:02:05,933 --> 01:02:08,198
the records for prisoner transfers

1090
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:09,994
and tell me where they sent

1091
01:02:10,024 --> 01:02:11,521
Michael Scofield

1092
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,958
and Lincoln Burrows.

1093
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,951
Thanks. Sure.

1094
01:02:49,382 --> 01:02:51,013
That's a great bag.

1095
01:02:51,053 --> 01:02:52,354
Can I ask you where you got it?

1096
01:02:52,384 --> 01:02:53,584
It was a gift from my boss,

1097
01:02:53,614 --> 01:02:55,515
so I don't really know, sorry.

1098
01:02:55,555 --> 01:02:57,156
Sure. Thanks.

1099
01:02:57,186 --> 01:02:58,216
There you go.

1100
01:02:58,256 --> 01:03:00,517
I, uh... I can never find a good bag.

1101
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:03,118
I'm a teacher, and I have books

1102
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:04,889
and grading materials and...

1103
01:03:04,919 --> 01:03:06,790
I should probably go
ahead and just invest

1104
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,991
in a wagon one of these days.

1105
01:03:09,021 --> 01:03:11,092
Yeah, that's why I love this bag.

1106
01:03:11,122 --> 01:03:13,123
It has so many pockets.

1107
01:03:13,163 --> 01:03:14,794
Do you mind if I take a look?

1108
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,124
Oh, no.

1109
01:03:16,164 --> 01:03:17,625
Thanks.

1110
01:03:37,634 --> 01:03:40,875
Ah, thank God, thank God.

1111
01:03:41,836 --> 01:03:43,376
You all right, mister?

1112
01:03:43,406 --> 01:03:46,778
Yeah, my damn truck blew
a gasket a few miles back.

1113
01:03:46,808 --> 01:03:49,039
I've been, uh, hoofing it ever since.

1114
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,279
Where you headed?

1115
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:52,410
San Diego.

1116
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,182
Hell, we can give you
a ride, if you'd like.

1117
01:03:56,382 --> 01:03:57,813
Hey, what's wrong, man?

1118
01:03:57,843 --> 01:03:59,013
Eat some bad Mexican?

1119
01:04:00,684 --> 01:04:03,015
Something like that.

1120
01:04:08,187 --> 01:04:10,218
Same as yesterday, right on schedule.

1121
01:04:15,621 --> 01:04:17,421
I hope to hell she's still got

1122
01:04:17,451 --> 01:04:19,722
that thing in her purse.

1123
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,896
Tuxhorn residence.

1124
01:04:26,926 --> 01:04:28,456
Hello, I'm from the alarm company.

1125
01:04:28,496 --> 01:04:30,327
We've been receiving some, uh,

1126
01:04:30,357 --> 01:04:32,398
strange signals from your property.

1127
01:04:32,428 --> 01:04:34,159
We'd like you to check
the windows, please.

1128
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:36,700
Make sure all the
contacts are still active.

1129
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:37,901
All the windows?

1130
01:04:37,931 --> 01:04:39,231
Yes, ma'am.

1131
01:04:39,261 --> 01:04:40,632
Every room in the house.

1132
01:04:43,103 --> 01:04:44,834
Okay, hold on.

1133
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:51,266
Does she still have the bag?

1134
01:04:51,306 --> 01:04:52,567
Yeah.

1135
01:04:57,709 --> 01:04:59,040
She's got it.

1136
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:01,471
I'm picking up all kinds
of gak from the house, man.

1137
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:04,072
Small stuff, maybe a digital
camera, an MP3 player.

1138
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:06,013
Nothing of the size of what
we're looking for, though.

1139
01:05:06,043 --> 01:05:07,114
Keep her moving.

1140
01:05:07,144 --> 01:05:08,244
So far, so good, ma'am.

1141
01:05:08,274 --> 01:05:10,475
Uh, please move on to the next room.

1142
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:16,548
How we doing?

1143
01:05:16,578 --> 01:05:17,848
Still don't got it.

1144
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,250
If the card's in there,

1145
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,021
it'd be in some kind of... a safe.

1146
01:05:24,051 --> 01:05:25,352
Office.

1147
01:05:25,382 --> 01:05:26,482
Ma'am, our system is showing

1148
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,783
that the malfunction
is coming from a room

1149
01:05:28,823 --> 01:05:31,824
that's designated as,
uh, an office or a den.

1150
01:05:31,854 --> 01:05:32,955
You mean the library?

1151
01:05:32,985 --> 01:05:34,626
Mister doesn't like me going in there.

1152
01:05:34,656 --> 01:05:37,057
Well, I think he'd like it
even less if you went home

1153
01:05:37,087 --> 01:05:39,158
without properly setting the
alarm first, don't you think?

1154
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:42,789
All right, I'll check.

1155
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:48,562
We got something.

1156
01:05:48,592 --> 01:05:49,592
The card?

1157
01:05:49,632 --> 01:05:50,833
Oh, yeah.

1158
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,234
File's so big it can't be anything else.

1159
01:05:52,264 --> 01:05:53,394
Now you just gotta keep her there

1160
01:05:53,434 --> 01:05:54,965
for two minute while
it finishes the burn.

1161
01:05:54,995 --> 01:05:56,666
Stall her, we need two minutes.

1162
01:05:56,696 --> 01:05:57,936
Ma'am, I think we found the source

1163
01:05:57,966 --> 01:05:59,537
of our problem
- if you could just stay

1164
01:05:59,567 --> 01:06:01,168
at that particular
window and hold it closed

1165
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:03,539
while we reset the
system, that should do it.

1166
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,174
Talk to me, Roland.

1167
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:16,975
It's almost there, almost, almost.

1168
01:06:17,005 --> 01:06:18,875
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1169
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,049
Come on.

1170
01:06:32,311 --> 01:06:34,052
Got it. Got it.

1171
01:06:34,082 --> 01:06:36,583
All right, ma'am, thank
you so much for your help.

1172
01:06:43,016 --> 01:06:45,917
All we need to do now, man, is just...

1173
01:06:45,957 --> 01:06:49,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
she's heading back inside.

1174
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:50,820
What for?
I don't know.

1175
01:06:54,721 --> 01:06:56,162
Oh, no.

1176
01:06:56,192 --> 01:06:57,322
No, we're good.

1177
01:06:58,193 --> 01:06:59,794
She's out.

1178
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:16,001
Hey! Hey!

1179
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:17,601
Hey, stop it!

1180
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,002
Wait here.

1181
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,336
I actually had to slow down

1182
01:07:28,376 --> 01:07:30,477
- not to catch you.
-I think I pulled a groin.

1183
01:07:33,138 --> 01:07:34,509
It's not in the bag.

1184
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:39,211
It's not here. How
could it not be in here?

1185
01:07:39,241 --> 01:07:42,082
The device, it's not here give me it.

1186
01:07:43,813 --> 01:07:45,714
Son of a bitch.

1187
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:54,148
twenty-six... twenty-seven...
twenty-eight...

1188
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:20,059
Go ahead.

1189
01:08:20,099 --> 01:08:21,930
Before Burrows and Scofield

1190
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,261
were allegedlly transferred

1191
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:26,062
to Arlington, someone posted their bail.

1192
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,602
I need to know who.

1193
01:08:27,633 --> 01:08:29,103
I'm showing a Bruce Bennett,

1194
01:08:29,133 --> 01:08:31,634
former aid to Governor Frank Tancredi.

1195
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:48,942
You think it fell out?

1196
01:08:48,972 --> 01:08:50,243
We looked everywhere.

1197
01:08:50,273 --> 01:08:51,973
You think we got the thing copied?

1198
01:08:52,013 --> 01:08:54,344
Like I said, I can't read the content

1199
01:08:54,374 --> 01:08:56,445
without downloading the device, but...

1200
01:08:56,475 --> 01:08:58,576
unless this Tuxhorn's got,
like, a 50,000-hour Tivo,

1201
01:08:58,616 --> 01:08:59,877
then, yeah, I think we got it.

1202
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:01,648
Doesn't matter if we got it
if we can't find it.

1203
01:09:01,678 --> 01:09:04,349
Where the hell is it?

1204
01:09:04,379 --> 01:09:06,080
It's still inside the house.

1205
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:08,521
That's why the maid went back inside.

1206
01:09:08,551 --> 01:09:09,581
She must have found it,

1207
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:10,882
assumed it belonged to her boss,

1208
01:09:10,922 --> 01:09:12,152
and then she left it behind.

1209
01:09:12,182 --> 01:09:13,853
Well, then guess what,
fellas, it's game over.

1210
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:14,954
You know how many months

1211
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,484
it took me to make that thing, Michael?

1212
01:09:16,524 --> 01:09:18,025
What, you just think I
can whip up another one

1213
01:09:18,055 --> 01:09:20,226
in a couple seconds?
- Losing it is not the problem.

1214
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,127
If they find it, that's the problem.

1215
01:09:22,157 --> 01:09:25,128
If they find out someone was
after that card, we're done.

1216
01:09:25,158 --> 01:09:27,559
What do you mean, done?
What does that mean?

1217
01:09:27,589 --> 01:09:28,860
Does that mean we're
gonna go back to prison?

1218
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:29,930
Are they gonna kill us?

1219
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,791
- What the hell does that mean?
- Shut up!

1220
01:09:34,092 --> 01:09:35,593
Means we go in and get it

1221
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:43,262
if we had a few days, we'll figure out

1222
01:09:43,332 --> 01:09:46,222
a way to pull this off, but I gather
we don't have that kind of time.

1223
01:09:46,252 --> 01:09:47,716
Yeah, you gather right.

1224
01:09:47,746 --> 01:09:49,311
Look, if you want us to get that device

1225
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:51,433
out of there, you gotta throw us a bone,

1226
01:09:51,473 --> 01:09:52,230
give us some extra help.

1227
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:53,526
What you're asking for

1228
01:09:53,566 --> 01:09:54,821
requires involving additional people,

1229
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:56,615
which, given the covert
nature of this operation,

1230
01:09:56,655 --> 01:09:57,711
I cannot do.

1231
01:09:57,751 --> 01:09:59,006
Then you're asking for the impossible.

1232
01:09:59,046 --> 01:10:00,670
No, what I'm asking
for is competence, okay?

1233
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,534
I'm not the one who
put the entire mission

1234
01:10:02,564 --> 01:10:04,158
in the hands of a damn maid.

1235
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:10,705
Look, if the Company finds that
copy of Scylla before we do,

1236
01:10:10,735 --> 01:10:12,857
that's it, Michael, that's ball game.

1237
01:10:12,897 --> 01:10:14,392
They're gonna find
out who was behind it,

1238
01:10:14,422 --> 01:10:15,448
and they're going to ghost us.

1239
01:10:15,488 --> 01:10:16,584
All of us.

1240
01:10:16,614 --> 01:10:18,308
Are you okay?

1241
01:10:19,932 --> 01:10:22,264
Yeah.

1242
01:10:23,191 --> 01:10:25,154
I'm fine.

1243
01:10:26,309 --> 01:10:27,675
Look, I didn't choose you to do this

1244
01:10:27,705 --> 01:10:28,840
because I had you in custody.

1245
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:29,966
I chose you to do this

1246
01:10:29,996 --> 01:10:31,431
because I believed
you could pull it off.

1247
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:33,753
Yeah, well, a lot of
people have believed in me

1248
01:10:33,783 --> 01:10:36,045
in the last few months, Agent Self.

1249
01:10:36,075 --> 01:10:38,765
Not all of them are alive today.

1250
01:10:40,928 --> 01:10:43,917
Can you get me back the device or not?

1251
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:49,826
All right, this is what we got.

1252
01:10:49,866 --> 01:10:52,417
The housekeeper saw the device
as she was leaving the house.

1253
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:55,277
Then she disappears back
inside for 15 seconds.

1254
01:10:55,307 --> 01:10:56,303
So, we know, wherever it is,

1255
01:10:56,343 --> 01:10:57,499
it's somewhere close to the door.

1256
01:10:57,539 --> 01:10:58,794
So, 15 seconds,

1257
01:10:58,834 --> 01:11:00,658
that's all we have to buy ourselves.

1258
01:11:00,688 --> 01:11:02,979
Listen, I'm not sure
how close we're gonna get

1259
01:11:03,019 --> 01:11:04,873
to this house, let alone inside of it,

1260
01:11:04,913 --> 01:11:06,138
but let's say that we do.

1261
01:11:06,168 --> 01:11:07,464
The alarm they got installed

1262
01:11:07,503 --> 01:11:09,028
in this house is triggered

1263
01:11:09,058 --> 01:11:11,888
1.2 seconds after broken
contact in any door or window.

1264
01:11:11,918 --> 01:11:14,339
Which would immediately send
the private security guards

1265
01:11:14,379 --> 01:11:16,531
with their 47 guns
rushing into the property.

1266
01:11:16,571 --> 01:11:18,166
And after 30 seconds, the alarm company

1267
01:11:18,195 --> 01:11:19,461
will dispatch vehicles to the property.

1268
01:11:19,491 --> 01:11:20,986
Three to four, depending
on availability.

1269
01:11:21,015 --> 01:11:23,248
After confirmation of a break-in,

1270
01:11:23,277 --> 01:11:24,603
they'll dispatch additional vehicles

1271
01:11:24,643 --> 01:11:26,994
to seal off any and all
exits from the property.

1272
01:11:27,034 --> 01:11:27,991
I don't know about this, Michael.

1273
01:11:28,031 --> 01:11:29,057
It's getting pretty clear

1274
01:11:29,087 --> 01:11:31,080
why they hired a bunch
of cons to do this job.

1275
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,212
It's not because they
wanted it off the books.

1276
01:11:33,242 --> 01:11:34,468
It's because we're expendable.

1277
01:11:34,508 --> 01:11:37,896
Who's gonna care if a bunch
of crooks wind up dead?

1278
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:38,922
It's suicide.

1279
01:11:38,952 --> 01:11:40,118
I'm gonna keep looking

1280
01:11:40,148 --> 01:11:41,742
and see what I can find.

1281
01:11:46,266 --> 01:11:48,020
That quote from The Odyssey.

1282
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,315
What about it?

1283
01:11:49,355 --> 01:11:52,544
I can't shake that line.

1284
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:54,696
"All that avails is flight."

1285
01:11:56,231 --> 01:11:59,120
What if flight is our only option, Linc?

1286
01:12:00,515 --> 01:12:01,472
What if our father-

1287
01:12:01,512 --> 01:12:02,708
after everything he discovered

1288
01:12:02,738 --> 01:12:04,302
about the Company,
what...

1289
01:12:05,856 --> 01:12:07,720
...what if that's what
he finally realized?

1290
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,042
You know, uh, the one
thing I remember most

1291
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:12,204
about Dad was the back of his head.

1292
01:12:12,234 --> 01:12:14,167
Always walking out the front door.

1293
01:12:14,197 --> 01:12:16,459
Always running from something.

1294
01:12:16,489 --> 01:12:18,850
Mom, us, himself.

1295
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,541
But the one thing he never ran away from

1296
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:24,490
was his belief that the
Company needed to be taken down.

1297
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:26,722
And we got an opportunity to do that.

1298
01:12:26,752 --> 01:12:28,974
Then this is our fight, not theirs.

1299
01:12:29,014 --> 01:12:32,034
Man, this... this ain't Fox River.

1300
01:12:32,064 --> 01:12:34,694
These guys chose to be here.

1301
01:12:34,724 --> 01:12:37,016
Remember that.

1302
01:12:37,046 --> 01:12:39,637
They got a choice.

1303
01:14:19,153 --> 01:14:20,448
Almost...

1304
01:14:20,449 --> 01:14:22,243
Ready?

1305
01:14:25,202 --> 01:14:26,528
Go.

1306
01:14:43,766 --> 01:14:45,231
Let's go! Let's go! Go!

1307
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:49,446
Go.

1308
01:14:56,521 --> 01:14:57,717
Come on, let's go.

1309
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:03,666
Where's it coming from?

1310
01:15:03,696 --> 01:15:04,892
It's across the street.

1311
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:13,561
Come on.

1312
01:15:24,622 --> 01:15:26,684
Go.

1313
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:39,100
Just something across the street.

1314
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,794
We got a team checking it out now.

1315
01:15:40,834 --> 01:15:43,554
You can go back inside, sir.

1316
01:15:53,818 --> 01:15:56,040
Must be out of town.

1317
01:16:00,525 --> 01:16:01,361
Yes!

1318
01:16:03,952 --> 01:16:05,706
Daddy, is everything okay?

1319
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:17,404
Alex...

1320
01:16:18,859 --> 01:16:21,052
Thanks, Jim.

1321
01:16:21,091 --> 01:16:22,745
Alex!

1322
01:16:22,785 --> 01:16:24,509
Let's go.

1323
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:55,968
Go!

1324
01:17:06,829 --> 01:17:08,982
Don't turn around,

1325
01:17:09,021 --> 01:17:12,170
unless you'd like to
experience a great deal of pain

1326
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:14,402
over an even greater length of time.

1327
01:17:14,432 --> 01:17:17,491
You-you know, just-just
take whatever you want here.

1328
01:17:17,521 --> 01:17:18,986
The only thing I want from you,

1329
01:17:19,016 --> 01:17:23,271
Bruce, is the answer
to a simple question:

1330
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:25,862
Where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows?

1331
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:27,954
I only know what-what I
read in the papers and...

1332
01:17:27,984 --> 01:17:28,951
Three days ago,

1333
01:17:28,981 --> 01:17:32,897
there were 105 inmates
in the supermax wing

1334
01:17:32,937 --> 01:17:36,255
of the U.S. penitentiary
in Livingston, Texas,

1335
01:17:36,285 --> 01:17:39,075
where the brothers were allegedly sent.

1336
01:17:39,115 --> 01:17:42,104
There are still 105 inmates there,

1337
01:17:42,134 --> 01:17:45,153
and no one has been
released during that time.

1338
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:49,079
Someone is playing a shell game, Bruce.

1339
01:17:49,109 --> 01:17:52,567
I'm just trying to find out who.

1340
01:17:52,597 --> 01:17:54,789
I have no criminal jurisdiction over...

1341
01:17:54,819 --> 01:17:57,380
I know you bailed them out.

1342
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:58,875
I know you've been in contact with

1343
01:17:58,905 --> 01:18:00,240
Sara Tancredi.

1344
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:02,332
I swear to you, I-I have no idea

1345
01:18:02,362 --> 01:18:04,425
where they are.

1346
01:18:06,318 --> 01:18:07,913
I guess we'll see about that.

1347
01:18:14,818 --> 01:18:16,442
Good luck, Teddy.

1348
01:18:16,482 --> 01:18:19,501
Who needs luck when you got
friends like you fellas, huh?

1349
01:18:22,162 --> 01:18:23,457
Hey, you mind if I take this

1350
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,514
old newspaper of yours with me?

1351
01:18:24,554 --> 01:18:25,709
No problem.

1352
01:18:25,749 --> 01:18:27,374
Sorry to hear about your friend, dude.

1353
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:31,130
It's all right.

1354
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,655
He had a full life.

1355
01:18:33,582 --> 01:18:34,747
Later, Teddy.

1356
01:18:50,721 --> 01:18:52,813
There you go.

1357
01:19:10,152 --> 01:19:11,417
Thirty-six,

1358
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:13,580
twenty-four,

1359
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:16,968
thirty-six.

1360
01:19:57,353 --> 01:20:00,124
Did you get it?

1361
01:20:00,154 --> 01:20:01,993
Let's make sure we got what we wanted.

1362
01:20:04,923 --> 01:20:06,455
Linc.
Yeah.

1363
01:20:06,494 --> 01:20:08,254
Don't let that thing out of your sight.

1364
01:20:08,294 --> 01:20:09,955
All right.

1365
01:20:11,925 --> 01:20:12,855
We're halfway there.

1366
01:20:12,895 --> 01:20:13,955
All we got to do is

1367
01:20:13,995 --> 01:20:14,995
that little B and E, and-

1368
01:20:15,025 --> 01:20:16,125
we're out of here.

1369
01:20:16,155 --> 01:20:18,126
Reminds me, I need to get ahold of Self,

1370
01:20:18,156 --> 01:20:19,326
see when we can get started.

1371
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:21,856
So what are you gonna do
when all this is over?

1372
01:20:24,157 --> 01:20:26,356
That's a good question.

1373
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:30,557
Brother, whatever this Scylla thing is,

1374
01:20:30,597 --> 01:20:32,398
it is a monster of a code.

1375
01:20:52,031 --> 01:20:54,731
Sara, I was gonna come down here

1376
01:20:54,761 --> 01:20:56,732
and ask if you wanted to talk some more

1377
01:20:56,762 --> 01:20:59,161
about what happened in Panama,

1378
01:20:59,202 --> 01:21:03,603
but, um, I think I already
know what you're gonna say.

1379
01:21:03,633 --> 01:21:04,703
How's that?

1380
01:21:04,733 --> 01:21:07,803
Because you're a little like me.

1381
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:11,363
Because you're gonna say you're
fine, that you can handle it.

1382
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:13,964
So, um,

1383
01:21:14,004 --> 01:21:16,635
I'll just leave it at this.

1384
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:19,534
I'm here.

1385
01:21:19,564 --> 01:21:21,435
Whenever you want to talk,

1386
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:22,605
I'm here.

1387
01:21:24,536 --> 01:21:26,136
Thank you.

1388
01:21:31,507 --> 01:21:34,507
You know that the only
thing that kept me alive

1389
01:21:34,537 --> 01:21:37,608
when I was being held was
the thought of being with you.

1390
01:21:39,908 --> 01:21:42,038
But I also knew that if
anything happened to me,

1391
01:21:42,068 --> 01:21:43,739
you were gonna blame
yourself, and you would spend

1392
01:21:43,769 --> 01:21:45,609
the rest of your life
punishing yourself for it,

1393
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:48,309
and... I can't

1394
01:21:48,339 --> 01:21:49,809
bear the thought of that.

1395
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:57,170
So can we make a deal
right now that we're even,

1396
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,271
and just wipe the slate clean

1397
01:21:59,311 --> 01:22:02,971
and no guilt and no responsibility?

1398
01:22:03,011 --> 01:22:04,472
If we're gonna be together,

1399
01:22:04,511 --> 01:22:06,772
I don't want it to be out
of a sense of obligation.

1400
01:22:06,812 --> 01:22:10,673
Or-or even that we should be,

1401
01:22:10,713 --> 01:22:12,212
because of what we've been through.

1402
01:22:12,242 --> 01:22:16,143
I-I...
I just want to start over.

1403
01:22:17,043 --> 01:22:18,973
Start over.

1404
01:22:19,014 --> 01:22:20,875
Okay.

1405
01:22:20,915 --> 01:22:25,175
But, uh, does that mean
I have to divorce my wife?

1406
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:28,816
Because you're still married

1407
01:22:28,845 --> 01:22:30,315
to a Russian stripper.

1408
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,216
Well, "A": I've been a little busy,

1409
01:22:32,245 --> 01:22:35,216
and "B": I'm pretty sure she was Czech.

1410
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:37,146
Hey, Michael.

1411
01:22:38,316 --> 01:22:39,377
What's wrong?

1412
01:22:39,417 --> 01:22:41,217
Whatever it is, it ain't it.

1413
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:42,216
I don't understand.

1414
01:22:42,247 --> 01:22:44,078
I thought you said we copied the card.

1415
01:22:44,118 --> 01:22:45,147
No, we did.

1416
01:22:45,177 --> 01:22:46,748
But according to the encryption code...

1417
01:22:46,778 --> 01:22:48,918
Okay, how do I make this clear?

1418
01:22:48,947 --> 01:22:53,019
If-If Scylla was like a
pizza, all we got's a slice.

1419
01:22:53,049 --> 01:22:55,120
So where's the rest of the data?

1420
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:56,419
I don't know. I don't know.

1421
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:57,520
I mean...

1422
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:59,249
I mean, I don't know how
we didn't see this coming.

1423
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,220
I mean, it-it makes perfect sense.

1424
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,950
It's like the nuclear launch codes.

1425
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:05,120
You don't give all that
information to just one person.

1426
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:06,620
How many do you give it to?

1427
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:08,351
Okay, that quote your father held onto-

1428
01:23:08,381 --> 01:23:10,851
in The Odyssey, Scylla
is a six-headed monster

1429
01:23:10,881 --> 01:23:12,652
that requires a
sacrifice of six soldiers

1430
01:23:12,682 --> 01:23:13,782
in order to pass.

1431
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:16,553
So Scylla isn't one card,

1432
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:18,852
it's six.

1433
01:23:25,984 --> 01:23:27,954
What does that mean? How we gonna find

1434
01:23:27,984 --> 01:23:28,954
five more of these things?

1435
01:23:28,984 --> 01:23:31,123
Michael! Michael!

1436
01:23:38,855 --> 01:23:40,356
I'm busy.

1437
01:23:40,386 --> 01:23:42,826
I don't care what she looks like.

1438
01:23:42,856 --> 01:23:44,726
Three tablespoons of water,

1439
01:23:44,756 --> 01:23:46,587
one of honey.

1440
01:23:46,627 --> 01:23:47,758
Nothing more.

1441
01:23:49,687 --> 01:23:52,427
If she knows something about
anything that's going on,

1442
01:23:52,457 --> 01:23:55,628
I'm going to find it.

1443
01:23:59,559 --> 01:24:01,059
Rise and shine, bitch.

1444
01:24:01,089 --> 01:24:02,888
Breakfast.

1445
01:24:40,035 --> 01:24:41,195
Michael?

1446
01:24:41,235 --> 01:24:43,294
Hey, Michael!

1447
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:46,936
You all right?

1448
01:24:46,965 --> 01:24:49,436
Yeah, I'm fine.

1449
01:24:49,466 --> 01:24:51,296
All this security makes you wonder

1450
01:24:51,337 --> 01:24:52,337
what the Company's hiding.

1451
01:24:52,366 --> 01:24:53,437
Only way to know

1452
01:24:53,467 --> 01:24:55,767
for sure is to find
those five other cards,

1453
01:24:55,797 --> 01:24:57,167
see for ourselves.

1454
01:24:57,197 --> 01:24:59,268
Think we'll have enough time?

1455
01:24:59,298 --> 01:25:00,698
Yeah.

1456
01:25:00,738 --> 01:25:03,198
We'll, uh...

1457
01:25:03,238 --> 01:25:04,898
We'll be fine.
