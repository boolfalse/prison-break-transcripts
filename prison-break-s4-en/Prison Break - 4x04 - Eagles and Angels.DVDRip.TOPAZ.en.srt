1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,533
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:08,104
They referred to it as Scylla.
It's like the Company's black book.

3
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:09,998
- What's that?
- Wireless hard drive.

4
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:12,700
Swallows up any electronic data
within 10 feet of it.

5
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:18,042
- And the information about it in Scylla?
- If we can get close enough, it's ours.

6
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:21,114
If Scylla was like a pizza,
all we got is a slice.

7
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:24,084
So Scylla isn't one card. It's six.

8
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:27,322
They killed my boy.
I need to find out who did it.

9
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:31,794
Rise and shine, bitch. Breakfast.

10
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:35,297
- Hello?
- Cole Pfeiffer, Gregory White here.

11
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:37,264
<i>I'll see you at GA TE tomorrow.</i>

12
00:00:37,435 --> 00:00:39,835
And I will personally hand you
your bonus check.

13
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:43,234
Sara Tancredi's somewhere safe,
isn't she, Bruce?

14
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:48,108
So tell me where is Sara?

15
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:52,776
Los Angeles? Good job.

16
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:56,679
It wasn't a meeting between
two Scylla cardholders, Agent Self.

17
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:59,380
It was a meeting between
all six cardholders.

18
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:02,185
So now we know who
has the other five cards.

19
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:16,838
Hey. You got anything off the video?

20
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:21,505
It's a camera phone from 50 feet away,
so it's pretty grainy.

21
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:23,670
It's still printing.

22
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:28,979
You ever been on one of those?

23
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,314
Yeah.

24
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:35,322
I was still drinking at the time,
so I don't remember much.

25
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:38,554
I'm told I was a lot of fun.

26
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:41,491
- You?
- No.

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,666
Not a lot of yachts where I'm from.

28
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,631
I always kind of wanted to live on one.

29
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:50,831
Thought it'd be nice
to have the ocean as my front yard.

30
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,977
The ocean is your front yard.

31
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:58,145
<i>What's wrong with the S.S. Minnow
back there?</i>

32
00:01:58,783 --> 00:02:02,446
Nothing. You really wanna drop that thing
in the water some day?

33
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,953
- Sail off to points unknown?
- Yeah, why not.

34
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:07,386
As long as it's you and me.

35
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,857
I like the sound of that.

36
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:15,756
<i>Yo, papi, we got something.</i>

37
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,506
One day.

38
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,444
- What's up?
- We got a... We got a license plate.

39
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:39,185
It's a printout from the camera phone.

40
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:41,757
The numbers are fuzzy.
The whole damn thing's fuzzy.

41
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:44,918
Forget the numbers, what's
next to the plate? Looks like a sticker.

42
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,222
- DMV?
- That's a flag.

43
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:48,627
- It's a diplomatic plate.
- Six P's, guys.

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,930
When I supervised 32 C.O.'s at Fox River,
it was the six P's made it happen.

45
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:56,733
- Can you blow it up? I need more detail.
- I'm already on it.

46
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,342
Prior planning
prevents piss-poor performance.

47
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,876
Quit shaking your ass
and say what's on your mind.

48
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:06,374
The second step. Deciphering the cards.
The break-in. We need to plan.

49
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,746
Agent Self will provide that information.

50
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,917
You worked with Whistler.
Didn't they say anything about a location?

51
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:14,490
Wasn't that in his bird book?

52
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:17,457
Which T-Bag has.
If he made it out of Sona alive.

53
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,656
Finding where the break-in is doesn't mean
anything if we don't have the cards.

54
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,061
Here's your flag.

55
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:26,828
- Algeria?
- Turkey.

56
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,604
Find out where the Turkish consul is
in town.

57
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:34,302
You know what,
get with the program or you're out.

58
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,004
Guy's name is Erol Tabak.
Consulate is downtown.

59
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:41,447
- Yeah, but we can't get into the consulate.
- But we can follow him from there.

60
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:43,177
Michael.

61
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:46,449
I'm gonna stay back
and work on the video.

62
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:48,091
Okay.

63
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:51,188
One day.

64
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,486
One day.

65
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:03,563
Cole Pfeiffer. How are you?

66
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:07,939
Cole, Pfeiffer. P-F-E-l-F-E... Damn it.

67
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,605
Cole Pfeiffer. How are you?

68
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:12,875
No.

69
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:16,779
No. Call me Cole, please.

70
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:21,156
P-F-E-l-F-E... Damn.

71
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:24,386
Breaking down the captivity
of negativity.

72
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:29,056
That's what we're doing here at GATE.
And I would encourage all of you to...

73
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:36,534
P-F-E-l-F-F-E-R.

74
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,573
F-E-R. P-F-E-l-F...

75
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:40,870
P-F-E-l-F-F...

76
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,077
What do diplomats usually do?

77
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:51,187
Not a whole lot
but they park anywhere they want.

78
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:53,688
Put this on the dash.

79
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:58,090
Can we get any closer?

80
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,770
That's our guy.

81
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:12,002
- Yeah?
- We're copying.

82
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,370
He's got the card on him.

83
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:15,569
<i>Hell, yes.</i>

84
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:20,040
That's his wife? Sign me up.

85
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,516
You lost it.

86
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:29,257
- How?
- I don't know what to tell you.

87
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:30,792
You lost it. It's gone, man.

88
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,725
- We lost it.
- What?

89
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:34,762
How did we lose it? We're next to him.

90
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,191
He's not the cardholder.

91
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:40,367
She is.

92
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:51,678
We gotta get out of here now,
before we get made.

93
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,817
Come on, let's go. Go.

94
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:43,793
- You know what we got in common, right?
- What?

95
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:47,096
We both live in the real world,
as opposed to these knuckleheads.

96
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:50,640
So that whole prior-planning thing
you were talking about?

97
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:53,606
If you got something on your mind
and no one is interested...

98
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:56,770
...you run it by me, okay?
And we'll leave it at that, all right?

99
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:10,817
<i>- Hello?
- Sara.</i>

100
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:12,857
Hey, it's Don Self.

101
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,329
Listen, I have some bad news.

102
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:20,465
Bruce Bennett was found dead
in his apartment this morning.

103
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:25,036
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,382
Lisa. Come in. This will be quick.
I know you're on a schedule.

105
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:46,826
The value of the kip is at 10 right now.
I'll let you know as soon as it reaches 15.

106
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:49,694
At that point,
you'll have to leave immediately.

107
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:53,928
- I have my bags with me. I could go now.
- Don't you have that event tonight?

108
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:59,233
- Yes. But I...
- It's important to keep up appearances.

109
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,775
Not arouse suspicion.

110
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:03,008
Fine.

111
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:08,185
I have no doubt in your leadership abilities,
Lisa, but...

112
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:12,550
Good, nor do I.
So I won't keep you any longer.

113
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:18,191
Please, be safe.

114
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:30,400
There she is.

115
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:34,935
All right, do what you gotta do.

116
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:38,741
Be next to her for two minutes
so the device can copy the card. I'll get it.

117
00:08:41,252 --> 00:08:42,617
Take a seat. Take a seat.

118
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:46,880
See the three suits
forming a triangle around her?

119
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:51,154
Those are private contractors. The Company
would only do that for the inner circle.

120
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,263
We're not getting
anywhere near that lady.

121
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:54,921
Right.

122
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,243
What's wrong?

123
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:34,197
Watch it.

124
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:40,640
Hey, watch out.

125
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,621
Hey, Teddy.

126
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,927
If it ain't the Brothers Grimm.

127
00:09:58,095 --> 00:10:01,428
Easy, Linc. Remember we need him.
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

128
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,227
I've been thinking about
getting me a career in pictures.

129
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:05,426
I'll give you a start.

130
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:07,696
If anyone's got a right to be pissed,
it's me.

131
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:11,035
You put me out to pasture back in Panama.
Left me for dead.

132
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,644
Which makes it the third time.
Congratulations, you got yourself a turkey.

133
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,871
- Where's the bird book?
- Bird book?

134
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:20,211
- Where's the book?
- Look who's looking pretty.

135
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:23,581
Look who's looking. I don't think
you are supposed to be carousing...

136
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:25,949
...around the Angel City
any more than I am.

137
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:28,353
You don't know
what you've gotten yourself into.

138
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:31,154
If you don't wanna found out,
tell us where that book is.

139
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:34,559
You're gonna let me go now,
or all of us are going down together.

140
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,060
Your choice.

141
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:38,599
Linc. Come on.

142
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:40,828
Linc!

143
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:02,116
Tancredi. T-A-N-C-R-E-D-I.

144
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:06,320
Make it a buckshot across the grid,
35 mile radius.

145
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:09,193
If she or any of those other names come up,
call me.

146
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:11,300
<i>Confirmed.</i>

147
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:17,933
Where are you?

148
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:23,069
Los Angeles. Trailing Dr. Sara Tancredi.

149
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:27,581
I asked for the knights,
you're chasing a pawn. She's irrelevant.

150
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:30,053
Not to Scofield.

151
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:34,457
<i>If anyone knows
what rock he's hiding under, it's her.</i>

152
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:35,953
What about Gretchen?

153
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:38,595
I'm having her softened up.

154
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:41,425
But I question the merit
of keeping her alive.

155
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:44,562
- I don't think you should allow...
- She must know something.

156
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:48,129
She lives until she talks.

157
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:51,741
Now, I have something else
I need you to do for me.

158
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:57,843
It seems a former employee
is looking into Scylla.

159
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:04,347
T-Bag's in town?

160
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:06,513
Yeah, but we lost him.
He could be anywhere.

161
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,251
It's not where he is, it's what he's doing.
He could blow this for all of us.

162
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:12,361
- Where's Sara?
- The boat.

163
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:19,469
Of course, it's my fault that he's dead.

164
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:21,434
- That's not true.
- We both know it is.

165
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:26,001
I shouldn't have called him.
I should never have reached out to him.

166
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:28,941
- I shouldn't have involved him...
- Bennett chose to help you.

167
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:34,042
The Company killed him, not you.

168
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:41,981
Listen to me, Sara. This is...
This is not your fault.

169
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:47,121
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:52,831
I'm really sorry.

171
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:20,422
- Can I help you?
- With that smile, you already have.

172
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:25,734
- I'm Cole Pfeiffer.
- Mr. Pfeiffer, welcome to Los Angeles.

173
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:27,871
Oh, please. Call me Cole.

174
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:31,166
Mr. White is looking forward
to meeting with you, Cole.

175
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:33,572
But he's just running a few minutes late.

176
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:37,106
Precisely how few minutes
are we talking about?

177
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:40,910
He shouldn't take long.
You can have a seat right over there.

178
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:45,579
Oh, I almost forgot.

179
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:48,486
- You already have a message.
- I do?

180
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:53,358
Mr. Xing called, twice.
I guess your reputation precedes you.

181
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,498
I guess so.

182
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:20,221
- Don Self.
- When did they find the body?

183
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:23,849
This morning. They're saying
it was a suicide, but you and I know better.

184
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:25,996
I need to ask you something
very important.

185
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:29,428
- Did Bruce Bennett know where you are?
- I don't know.

186
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,865
Because if he did, there's a good chance
that the Company does now too.

187
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:36,529
So you need to work double-time.
Get some eyes in the back of your head.

188
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:38,766
Look, I appreciate
the motivational speech.

189
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:42,777
How about you figure out where we have
to break-in so we can decode those cards.

190
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:45,347
I've got a guy doing some digging, okay?

191
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:50,146
- Actually, you might have two.
- What? What are you talking about?

192
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,118
His name is Theodore Bagwell.

193
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:55,258
He was with us in Panama
and now he's here in Los Angeles.

194
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:57,724
He has a book
that used to belong to Whistler.

195
00:14:57,895 --> 00:15:00,022
And Mahone thinks...

196
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:02,993
Mahone thinks this book has a plan
for the break-in.

197
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,631
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- I wish I were.

198
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:16,271
<i>You've reached Jasper Potts.
Leave a message.</i>

199
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:20,178
It's me. I need that information we talked
about like, yesterday. You understand?

200
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:24,412
Call me back.
Call me back as soon as possible.

201
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:31,127
"Lisa Tabak. Wife of the Turkish consul.
Married four years. Children, none.

202
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:34,787
Listed as the logistician
in the executive profile for SENSA.

203
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:39,095
A privately funded think tank with offices in
D.C., New York, Chicago and Los Angeles."

204
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,601
Yeah, the only thing I wanna know
is her schedule.

205
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:45,333
- What she's doing, where she's going.
- We might not have that kind of time.

206
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:49,305
This morning, when she first got out
of the car, she had a suitcase.

207
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,813
Let's check the airlines. Match her name
against any departing flights.

208
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:55,543
- Maybe she's already gone.
- I don't think so.

209
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:58,719
If she's going today,
it's gonna be on the redeye.

210
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,882
According to this press release, Lisa Tabak
is being honored at some charity shindig.

211
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,393
That's great. That's where we'll get her.
What's the benefit for?

212
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:10,932
She's the top donor of an organization
called Eagles and Angels.

213
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:13,592
- Eagles and Angels?
- You've heard of it?

214
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:19,306
When a police officer dies
in the line of duty, he's an Eagle.

215
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:22,570
The ones he leaves behind are Angels.

216
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:25,306
That's a benefit
for the Association of Law Enforcement.

217
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:30,579
If you're gonna get near her, it's gonna be
with about half the cops in L.A.

218
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:47,300
- Jasper, where the hell you been?
- Thinking.

219
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:51,202
Thinking? The only thing you should be
thinking about is what I asked you to get.

220
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,740
Did you find the location?

221
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,277
Yes. Don't say anything else, okay?
I heard clicks yesterday on my phone.

222
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:59,143
- Look, settle down. I'm coming to you.
- It doesn't matter.

223
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:02,376
You're never gonna be able to get in.
Not where they're keeping it.

224
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:06,956
- I should have never helped you out.
- Just relax. I'm coming to you right now.

225
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:35,851
Think they're strong enough?

226
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:38,449
Together they should be.

227
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:43,293
- Here's everything on the list.
- You sure we have to steal them?

228
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,521
It's the one thing we need that we can't get
at a store. So yes, we gotta steal them.

229
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:50,690
- We'll get everything and meet you there.
- All right.

230
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:58,772
- Look, you gonna be okay?
- Yeah. I just need time.

231
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:04,636
- All right. I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Okay.

232
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:13,386
I am so sorry I'm not gonna be around
next week to see you in action, Cole.

233
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:17,960
But you'll be in good hands with Andy here.
I have to catch a flight to San Francisco.

234
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:20,824
I just wanted to say how thrilled we are
to have you here.

235
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:25,594
And hopefully, some of the rest
of the sales force can learn a thing or two.

236
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:28,465
We'll settle up that check
when I get back, all right?

237
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:31,836
Remember, don't call it Frisco.
They hate that up there.

238
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:33,406
True.

239
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:36,910
- Why don't I show you to your office, Cole.
- Okay.

240
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,811
I'm sorry. I didn't see anywhere in your
paperwork that you were handicapped.

241
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:44,420
Otherwise, I would have made the
necessary adjustments to your work space.

242
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:49,252
Andy, I like to think of myself
as handi-capable.

243
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:51,451
Right. Yeah.

244
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:53,786
Well, here you are.

245
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:55,556
Right, right.

246
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:59,634
So this is where I'm gonna be doing my...
My work.

247
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:02,897
Right here, in this office.

248
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:04,404
That's right.

249
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,373
So I better be rolling up my sleeves then.

250
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:10,809
You know, Cole, I gotta tell you
I'm still a little amazed...

251
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:14,382
...that somebody I've never even seen
at a convention or seminar...

252
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:18,885
...just falls from the sky
and shatters all of our sales records.

253
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:23,425
When you believe in GATE like I do,
it ain't that hard to sell.

254
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:26,828
And there you go.

255
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:33,935
Well, and here's your corner office,
as requested.

256
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:38,272
- Welcome to the team.
- Alrighty then. Thank you.

257
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:55,222
122 B.

258
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:11,540
Hello, Sara.

259
00:20:27,257 --> 00:20:29,748
Hey, Sara, where you going?

260
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:54,308
- What can I get you?
- Club soda, please.

261
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,960
- How many years?
- Sorry?

262
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:07,460
In the program.
How many years have you been sober?

263
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:10,896
- Three years and three months.
- Good for you.

264
00:21:11,635 --> 00:21:13,296
Yeah, it doesn't feel good today.

265
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:17,400
But I'll take the high-five
for cracking the big question.

266
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:19,537
Which is?

267
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:23,803
Is life a tragedy? Or is there...

268
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:26,846
...hope?

269
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:29,675
You tell me.

270
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:36,918
Double bourbon, neat.

271
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,161
Just pour it.

272
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:53,505
Cheers, honey.

273
00:23:52,562 --> 00:23:54,086
Over here.

274
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,344
Eagles and Angels,
with contributions from the Company.

275
00:24:53,957 --> 00:24:56,551
This thing's supposed to start
in five minutes.

276
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:19,007
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- No problem. Where do you work out of?

277
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:23,551
It's one of my guys up there.

278
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,721
- I'm sorry. I'm just...
- Oh, sure. Sure. Of course.

279
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:41,336
I mean, I've known him my whole life.
He's a very close person to my family.

280
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:43,665
It's always the good ones.

281
00:25:44,274 --> 00:25:46,333
You ain't gonna drink that?

282
00:25:47,277 --> 00:25:49,837
Honey, the good Shepard's here
to ease your pain.

283
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:53,942
Ronald Winston Shepard.
But you can call me Shep.

284
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:56,415
Shep, I really don't feel
like talking right now.

285
00:25:58,088 --> 00:26:01,148
- Well, you've been talking to her.
- Leave her alone, okay?

286
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:06,858
Pardon me.

287
00:26:21,211 --> 00:26:22,269
Go on.

288
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:27,777
<i>When I was 13,
I had to go see Annie the musical.</i>

289
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:33,415
My mom had passed away earlier that year
and my dad had agreed to take me...

290
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,891
...and I was all ready in my new dress.

291
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,791
And...
And I knew every word of this thing.

292
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:45,127
My dad called from work
and said he wasn't gonna make it.

293
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:47,531
That wasn't the first time.

294
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:52,266
And I remember feeling
like I was floating.

295
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,838
Like I was the only person
in the whole word.

296
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:04,645
Then Bruce came.
He showed up to take me and...

297
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:10,223
And after, he took me home
and he said...

298
00:27:10,393 --> 00:27:14,090
...that if I ever needed him,
he'd be there for me.

299
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:23,835
And a month ago,
I needed him and I called him.

300
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:28,969
And he died for it.

301
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:34,449
- Hey.
- Just a sec.

302
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:39,518
What would he want you to do?

303
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:50,558
Let me do you a favor.

304
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:54,630
Can I settle up here?

305
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:08,713
Before we sit down to eat...

306
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:13,219
...l'd like to welcome everyone to the
15th Annual Eagles and Angels Benefit.

307
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:17,517
We all know why we're here tonight.

308
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:19,924
So I'd like to begin
with a moment of silence...

309
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:22,322
...to renew our dedication to the law.

310
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,997
And to honor those
who's lives were cut short...

311
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:28,729
...by their fearless pursuit of justice.

312
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:32,673
They will truly be missed.

313
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,168
Thank you. Enjoy your dinner.

314
00:29:17,787 --> 00:29:18,981
I've been made, guys.

315
00:29:19,155 --> 00:29:20,622
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

316
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,323
Just get the card copied.

317
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:30,432
Here we go.

318
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:39,002
We're copying.

319
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,238
Hi. My condolence.

320
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:47,982
Yes.

321
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:50,346
The kip's at 15.

322
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:53,722
I understand.

323
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:02,226
I am very sorry
but I'm gonna have to leave.

324
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:18,803
Yeah, I am so sorry. So, so sorry.

325
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:20,973
What is she doing?

326
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:22,445
She's leaving.

327
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:24,747
I am so sorry.

328
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:26,354
No, no, no, not again.

329
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:33,959
- Yeah.
- I've been made. Meet me out back.

330
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:36,489
Go.

331
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:48,434
Hey.

332
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:49,870
Lincoln Burrows.

333
00:30:57,053 --> 00:30:59,578
- I don't know who you think I am...
- I know who you are.

334
00:30:59,756 --> 00:31:01,121
Unclip the gun. Slowly.

335
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:11,824
Three, copy.

336
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:14,731
<i>- I'm so sorry.
- Three, copy.</i>

337
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:19,139
Move. Move it.

338
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,475
Let's get the device.

339
00:31:26,482 --> 00:31:28,074
That's far enough.

340
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:30,185
Why don't you just call one of the cops?

341
00:31:30,353 --> 00:31:34,289
I work for the Company, Burrows.
We don't need cops. Got any last words?

342
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,731
- Yeah?
- We got a problem.

343
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,174
- I just killed one of the guards.
- Let's go now.

344
00:31:56,913 --> 00:31:58,073
No, we don't have it yet.

345
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:01,512
Do what you gotta do.
We gotta get rid of the body.

346
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,624
- Let them find him.
- What?

347
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,156
Wait for Mahone.

348
00:32:32,048 --> 00:32:33,345
Gretchen.

349
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:39,084
How's my girl?

350
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:51,060
It seems your friend, Whistler
wasn't the only one looking into Scylla.

351
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:54,200
Do you know anything about that?

352
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:56,363
No.

353
00:32:57,306 --> 00:32:58,864
No.

354
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:05,173
You never know anything, do you?

355
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:09,381
You have nothing to do with any of this.

356
00:33:09,552 --> 00:33:12,521
Scofield, Burrows.

357
00:33:12,688 --> 00:33:15,316
- You don't know who...
- No.

358
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:19,493
You can't keep lying to me.

359
00:33:22,298 --> 00:33:25,461
I don't know. I don't know.

360
00:33:32,408 --> 00:33:37,072
You look so damn easy.

361
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,884
I can make this a lot harder.

362
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:53,085
Yes.

363
00:33:53,262 --> 00:33:57,995
<i>A credit card belonging to Bruce Bennett
was just used in a bar in San Pedro.</i>

364
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,552
- Thank you for coming.
- Absolutely.

365
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,786
Excuse me. Excuse me.

366
00:34:23,993 --> 00:34:26,461
We have a DO A outside.
I believe it's one of your men.

367
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:29,962
- You need to come with me.
- Excuse me?

368
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:34,331
No one's leaving here
until we make an ID, please.

369
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:39,500
- Mathers, stay with Mrs. Tabak.
- What happened? I have a plane to catch.

370
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:43,406
I understand. We'll make this fast.
Officer Mathers, he'll wait with you. Please.

371
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:44,876
Stay with her.

372
00:34:46,015 --> 00:34:49,781
If you could just wait with me, ma'am.
Thank you.

373
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,280
- What's going on?
- It should only take a few minutes.

374
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:04,964
Oh, here we go. Come on. Come on.

375
00:35:09,372 --> 00:35:10,634
This is a nice memorial.

376
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:16,804
I very much respect
the sacrifices you men make.

377
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:19,844
There's a lot of bad people out there.

378
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:25,180
Officer Mathers, you...
You have something... You've...

379
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:27,618
Your nose is bleeding.

380
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:53,876
One day.

381
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:08,530
Excuse me, I'm looking for this woman.

382
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,365
Sara Tancredi.

383
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,911
- Here. Take that.
- Thank you.

384
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,285
You okay?

385
00:36:37,994 --> 00:36:39,723
Here we go. Here we go.

386
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:42,729
Here we go. Hell, yes.

387
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,830
It's nothing. Travel safely.

388
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,801
Mrs. Tabak, we gotta leave.

389
00:36:53,242 --> 00:36:54,971
Ma'am, now.

390
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:59,741
I'm telling you, I haven't seen her.

391
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:01,441
You're sure?

392
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:27,442
Oh, look at them fellas.
It's the pigs. Run.

393
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,271
Shut up, wiseass.

394
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:33,782
- You sure you got the whole thing?
- A hundred percent.

395
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:36,440
- Where's Sara?
- It's not my turn to watch her.

396
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:38,849
What are we gonna do?
Someone must have seen us.

397
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:41,182
Don't worry, it's handled.

398
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:46,626
Politically motivated?

399
00:37:46,796 --> 00:37:49,230
Possibly an Armenian.

400
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:55,702
Tip came in to the L.A.P.D. The assailant
thought the consul was at the event.

401
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:57,896
Lisa's bodyguard got in the way.

402
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:02,467
- Did Lisa make her flight?
- Yes, general.

403
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:22,495
- What do you got?
- I had a guy.

404
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:25,324
I did. I had a guy.

405
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:28,937
He was an informant. He used to work
for the Company for about 11 years...

406
00:38:29,105 --> 00:38:31,630
...until he turned against them
and decided to help me.

407
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:34,708
He said he had the location we needed.

408
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:39,748
But I found him dead
in his apartment today.

409
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:42,145
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

410
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:48,322
- First Bennett. Now your guy, huh?
- Yep. They're closing in on us.

411
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:50,550
There's no doubt about it.

412
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:57,928
And now I'm empty-handed and
I have no idea where we need to break into.

413
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:03,837
We keep moving forward, Agent Self.
Nothing changes, no matter what.

414
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:05,701
Right.

415
00:39:07,276 --> 00:39:08,766
Okay.

416
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:13,213
Regardless of what happens, I...

417
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:16,414
I like your style, Scofield.

418
00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:31,125
- You need anything else, Mr. Cole?
- I'm all right, little lady.

419
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:50,181
What was your plan, Mr. Whistler?
What was your plan?

420
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:58,556
Shan Xing.

421
00:40:01,997 --> 00:40:05,262
Cole Pfeiffer did not arrive
for our meeting.

422
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:13,366
So you don't have Scylla?

423
00:40:18,781 --> 00:40:21,272
Next time, Shan Xing.

424
00:40:34,797 --> 00:40:38,597
I'll be in Los Angeles,
if anyone needs me.

425
00:40:39,902 --> 00:40:43,702
Number two down.
On to number three.

426
00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:47,534
Did we manage to get everything off
of Lisa Tabak's phone?

427
00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:52,477
I don't know.
I didn't pick up anything but the card.

428
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:07,590
I wanna thank you
for what you did back there.

429
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:22,210
I need you to do something for me.

430
00:41:22,611 --> 00:41:24,704
Yeah, doesn't everybody.

431
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:29,614
I'm looking for the man
who killed my son.

432
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:35,887
What do you need?

433
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:38,083
Here's the police report.

434
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,821
I need you to get into the FBI database...

435
00:41:42,898 --> 00:41:47,562
...and find a profile.
This man is a professional assassin.

436
00:41:47,736 --> 00:41:52,730
He's African-American, 6"4'.
About 220 pounds.

437
00:41:54,643 --> 00:41:56,543
That's for your eyes only.

438
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:17,825
- Hi.
- Hey, are you all right?

439
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:20,167
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

440
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:23,100
Well, I was worried. Where are you?
Let me come and get you.

441
00:42:23,272 --> 00:42:25,740
No, it's okay. I'm almost home.

442
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:32,843
Listen, you're what's keeping me going
right now.

443
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,448
And you're all I have left.
And that scares me.

444
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,155
I just wanna be together.

445
00:42:42,324 --> 00:42:46,385
I know the circumstances
are a little less than ideal...

446
00:42:46,996 --> 00:42:51,194
...but we are together.
You're here. I'm here.

447
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:54,358
It's not one day anymore. It's...

448
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:56,470
It's today.

449
00:43:00,776 --> 00:43:05,145
Well, why don't you come back
and we'll make some dinner.

450
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:08,147
And maybe find a little time for ourselves.

451
00:43:08,317 --> 00:43:10,444
Yeah, I'll be right there.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
