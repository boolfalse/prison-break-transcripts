1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Previously onPrison Break:

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,020
This is Scylla.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,500
You're not even close to getting out of here.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,920
Dad? It's me.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,890
Lisa?

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,010
I'm at gunpoint. It's Tancredi.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,430
She says if you don't let Michael and the others leave with Scylla,she'll kill me.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,730
Don't!

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:22,990
I'm leaving.

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,960
No,Mr. White!

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,380
Turn around!

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,780
Gentle now,sugar.

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,810
That's Special Agent Miriam Holtz to you,sugar.

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,660
- We have it! - They got it.

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,960
I never thought you'd make it this far. I was wrong.

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,200
What now?

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,040
This is all your transfer paperwork.

18
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,000
You need to get to Dallow,ASAP.

19
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,140
What happened to Gretchen?

20
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,120
She got away.

21
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,480
Self

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,970
Self

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,440
He screwed us.

24
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,720
Self can't do that.

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,920
He's government.He can do what he pleases.

26
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,000
The vans are coming. They're just late.

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,980
He ain't coming back!

28
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,270
You don't know that,Linc! They're coming!

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,810
What do we do now?

30
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,350
Call Homeland.

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,180
See how much they know about Self.

32
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,860
Stanton

33
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,710
Herb,it was Scofield and Burrows.

34
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,240
Are you at the Senator's office?

35
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,420
I think I'm shot! I'm shot!

36
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,190
Miriam's,gone,okay?

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,440
What's your position?

38
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,920
You were right about this whole operation.

39
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,360
No. Burrows,Burrows!

40
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,200
Don,don!

41
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,640
No,no,no,no!

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,080
I need to find Gretchen.

43
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,730
You gonna help me?

44
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,110
Or you gonna make me shoot you in the face?

45
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,330
Help.

46
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,750
Department of Homeland Security.

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,890
I'd like to talk to Don Self's superior,please.

48
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,470
One moment,please.

49
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,890
We gave this guy something worth $100 million.

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,120
Is he even with Homeland? Did we see a badge?

51
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,560
We were given guns and flown out on a C-130.

52
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,820
He didn't work for the DMV.

53
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,330
That doesn't make him the law.

54
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,070
No,it don't.

55
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,630
What if Homeland was in on this from the beginning?

56
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,370
This is Herb Stanton. Who the hell's this?

57
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,190
Hello? Hello?

58
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,210
The way Self played this,I don't know. He kept himself too insulated.

59
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,160
That's why,that's why he hesitated with official authorizations on behalf of our mission.

60
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,300
He kept saying it was because he didn't want the Company to find out.

61
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,530
In actuality,it's because he didn't want to get caught,the son of a bitch!

62
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,660
He kept the circle tight.

63
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,990
Left the rest of us holding the bag.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,620
If Homeland knows where we're at,sooner or later they're coming for us.

65
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,900
Let them come-- we didn't do anything wrong. We have deals.

66
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,850
No,we have paper. That's what Self left us. That's what we have.

67
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,230
We gotta get out of here.

68
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,520
We can't leave. Michael needs surgery.

69
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,120
I'm not talking about running.

70
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,910
I'm talking about surviving.

71
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,030
What I want is to see the Company burned to the ground

72
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,660
and you in prison.

73
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,170
We did this to you. We did this to you.

74
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,870
They're ready for you downstairs,sir.

75
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,760
Today marks a critical juncture in our endeavor.

76
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,290
Do we have a bead on Scylla yet?

77
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,770
Our security,our future stands at a great precipice.

78
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,600
It's a yes-or-no question,Jonathan.

79
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,960
And we don't need a soliloquy.

80
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,350
- Howard,why don't you wait in my office? - No.

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,010
I'm in here making sure this operation isn't fumbled as well.

82
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,650
Out... now.

83
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,670
What's your plan,Jonathan?

84
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,720
That's what we're all here for,right?

85
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,040
You tried to move Scylla over our better judgment,and it backfired,so spill it.

86
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,490
Any further questions?

87
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,410
Very well. You have your assignments.

88
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,810
Access your assets and retrieve Scylla today.

89
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,820
Yeah,well,a lot of people that believed in me in the last few months,Agent Self,

90
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,900
not all of them are alive today.

91
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,280
I can't shake that line.

92
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,830
"All that avails is flight."

93
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,160
Come on.

94
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,680
Here,take that.

95
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,860
Sara's right.

96
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,610
We need to get you to a hospital now.

97
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,610
We were so close to the finish line.

98
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,240
So close.

99
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,830
Yeah,I know,I know,I know.

100
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,280
Listen,I,uh,I spoke to LJ yesterday.

101
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,520
Told him this was almost over.

102
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,590
I'm keeping my word to my son,Michael.

103
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,400
I should have seen this coming.

104
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,180
No,no,it's no one's fault.

105
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,180
Self played all of us.

106
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,520
We gotta get out of here.

107
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,170
This is our last option.

108
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,070
Yeah.

109
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,840
Clear.

110
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,270
Now we know where we stand.

111
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,250
Let's go.

112
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,330
Hello.

113
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,030
Michael Scofield.

114
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,070
Yes.

115
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,450
Herb Stanton,Department of Homeland Security.

116
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,860
We want to talk.

117
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,840
Can you please come back to the warehouse?

118
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,100
All right,but first we're gonna need some assurances.

119
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,840
What kind of assurances?

120
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,580
Look,we held up our end of the deal,so we're gonna need you to honor the terms of our agreements.

121
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,730
Well,I'd have to take another look at those terms,

122
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,680
but I'm fairly certain it didn't include stealing Scylla or killing two federal agents in cold blood.

123
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,980
What are you talking about?

124
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,890
Here are the new terms I'm prepared to offer.

125
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,090
Come back,turn yourselves in...

126
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,070
Wait a minute! Self set us up!

127
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,740
Don't,and I'll hunt you down like animals.

128
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,180
<font color=#00FFFF>Prison Break Season04 Episode13</font>

129
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,320
We did what they said.

130
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,330
I ain't going down on some trumped-up murder charge.

131
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,970
Self pinned two murders on us.

132
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,490
What are you doing,Linc?

133
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,700
- If Homeland Security comes...  - Then we'll handle it.

134
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,940
You know what?

135
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,690
There's gotta be a point where you draw the line.

136
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,080
Now's the time to draw that line.

137
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,740
Don't be stupid. You can't fight off all of Homeland.

138
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,100
Stupid is listening to the government.

139
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,110
I ain't going back to death row.

140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,720
We can still hold onto our deals.

141
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,420
All we have to do is flush Self out,prove he has Scylla.

142
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,220
How are we gonna do that,huh?

143
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,410
We have to devise another strategy.

144
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,370
We should start devising a plan that can get us a hundred miles across the Mexican border.

145
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,550
That's what we should do.

146
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,160
My cousin Petey can hook us up.

147
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,270
We're not running. We can't.

148
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,860
Negative on Scofield,Burrows and Mahone.

149
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,770
TDZ think that Self may be using a bakergrip to mask his cell phone signal.

150
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,790
Place a tactical team around Homeland.

151
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,410
If Self or any of those other bastards show up,

152
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,270
make damn well sure they don't get near the building.

153
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,500
I can't go back to living in and out of motels,constantly looking over my shoulder.

154
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,830
Nothing changes. We take down the Company.

155
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,790
We finish what we started.

156
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,540
Who are you calling?

157
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,670
A doctor.

158
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,970
Sara,not now.

159
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,860
When?

160
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,090
Whoa-whoa-whoa,listen.

161
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,490
Cole Pfeiffer,an employee of GATE,a downtown wellness organization,

162
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,980
and his yet-unidentified- female accomplice both seen here in police sketches.

163
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,330
both seen here in police sketches.

164
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,180
Gretchen?Bagwell?

165
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,870
Have our people at DOT monitor every traffic camera from San Diego to the Bay Area.

166
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,750
I can't believe you shot him.

167
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,490
Knowing when to sever a cancerous limb to preserve the rest of the body...

168
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,880
He was one of your most trusted advisors and confida...

169
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,700
When I brought you in I told you

170
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,940
that a cardholder has certain responsibilities.

171
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,640
If you can't handle what we're doing here,it's time you let me know.

172
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,750
CEO Gregory White who was shot and killed in the standoff.

173
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,570
Police are trying to determine whether revenge or robbery was the motive.

174
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,280
Cole Pfeiffer was a recent addition...

175
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,370
Maybe we weren't the only ones left hanging,huh?

176
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,810
If we're gonna flush Self out,how do you think he intended to unload Scylla?

177
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,830
Gretchen

178
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,070
He's got to sell it.

179
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,960
Tell me when I'm getting warm.

180
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,160
You hand-picked Michael Scofield and the bunch,trucked them all out here on Uncle Sam's dime,

181
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,970
to do your bidding,and now they're standing right in the crosshairs for what you did.

182
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,870
I gotta hand it to you Don,if that ain't the Mona Lisa.

183
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,650
I always said cops are more crooked than criminals.

184
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,540
Let me guess-- a little,little slice of heaven,is that what it was for?

185
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,600
Gambling debt?

186
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,330
Maybe you're a... a geologist of the rock candy variety?

187
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,790
The information you got from Gretchen's prints-- you sure it's the right address?

188
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,050
- Right as rain. - Good. Now,shut up or I'm gonna shoot you.

189
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,880
Understand me? Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth.

190
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,300
- I know when to shut my... - Be quiet.

191
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,540
How long does it take to find a pay phone in this city?

192
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,030
They'll be back.

193
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,220
Okay.

194
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,070
- Same deal as before. - Yeah.

195
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,440
No physical duress for the next eight hours.

196
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,990
Here's the thing. You need help.

197
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,350
And running around trying to track down Self isn't... safe.

198
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,160
We could be in Mexico in a few hours.

199
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,320
There are doctors there that I trust.

200
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,610
And you've been taking care of all of us.

201
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,200
I think it's really okay if we take care of you.

202
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,920
Surgery or no surgery...

203
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,570
I'm never gonna be able to live with myself unless I find a way to take these people down.

204
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,000
It's that simple,and,uh... I get it.

205
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,170
I'm not gonna demand that you feel the same way.

206
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,660
I'm telling you,we can't trust anyone-- government,law enforcement...

207
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,920
Which is all the more reason we should consider getting out of here.

208
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,500
No. We deal with this now.

209
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,860
I want this guy as much as you do,but we're scrambling here.

210
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,580
I mean,I don't know how long Self has been planning this thing and from the looks of it,it's pretty air-tight.

211
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,450
Gretchen

212
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,640
I hope you're calling me to tell me where Scylla is,Lincoln.

213
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,440
You don't know?

214
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,450
Idon'tknow. What's going on?

215
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,670
Self double-crossed us and he took Scylla.

216
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,850
You know where he could be?

217
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,960
If I'm Self,I'm looking for a new buyer.

218
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,690
A new buyer? You know what?

219
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,750
If you're playing me,I'm gonna split you in half.

220
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,190
Yeah. I want him just as badly as you do.

221
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,450
Where are you? I'm coming to you.

222
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,710
Grand Hope Park. One hour.

223
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,170
What?

224
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,210
Sis.

225
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,520
It's... Emily. She's,um... been in an accident.

226
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,090
I want you to tell whoever's got that gun pointed at you to grow a set and get on the phone.

227
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,490
She wants to talk to you.

228
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,250
What's up,Gretchen?

229
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,210
Time to come home now.

230
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,530
rusting that bitch?

231
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,710
Gretchen and T-Bag were waiting at GATE with machine guns,guys.

232
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
You think they just wanted to provide cover?

233
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,670
This chick's a mercenary.

234
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,600
She'll do whatever it takes to get what she wants,

235
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,630
and right now we just happen to want the same thing.

236
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,740
Wearetaking precautions,but...

237
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,100
one way or the other,Gretchen's gonna get us to Self,and right now...

238
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,710
that is all that matters.

239
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,320
We don't stand a chance.

240
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,820
Our photos aren't plastered all over the TV.

241
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,250
Homeland's keeping it in-house.

242
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,470
We have a chance.

243
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,390
- Senator? - Herb.

244
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,410
We sponsored this operaton with the best of intentions,

245
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,650
but the secretive manner in which we've handled it

246
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,490
I now fear is working against us.

247
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,250
How so?

248
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,510
We're in the middle of a manhunt,

249
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,520
and it's just you and a couple of agents out there trying to rein in these cons.

250
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,440
It's madness.

251
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,290
What we initally sponsored...

252
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,280
didn't pan out.

253
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,580
That doesn't mean that the boat is taking on water.

254
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,220
No one knows.

255
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,240
That's the way it's going to stay.

256
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,880
Come in!

257
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,340
Good afternoon. Richard Sooter,US Marshals Service.

258
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,220
I've been sent at the request of Deputy Director Esmar

259
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,880
to get to the bottom of the Scofield/Burrows Supermax story once and for all.

260
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,460
I'm hoping you gentlemen can help.

261
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,840
Guys,if there's a reason you're keeping secrets...

262
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,520
just fill me in here. I canhelp.

263
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,410
How strong is your stomach?

264
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,710
Very.

265
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,540
Herb... Stanton

266
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,230
He's working with Donald Self.

267
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,580
We got a record of all incoming and outgoing calls from Homeland today.

268
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:07,160
Stanton received a call lasting approximately one minute

269
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,920
that was connected to no one.

270
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,830
No one we could identify.

271
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,180
Self's phone.

272
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,780
D. O. T. has a positive ID on Gretchen from a traffic cam.

273
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,560
She's still in Los Angeles.

274
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,800
Chris is on the phone from Johannesburg,looking for an update.

275
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,400
I'll call back.

276
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,850
Now,about this Mr. Stanton...

277
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,600
Alex,how are you doing?

278
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,350
No sign of Gretchen yet.

279
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,350
Linc?

280
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,580
No sign of Gretchen.

281
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,790
Sucre?

282
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,290
She ain't here yet,bro.

283
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,180
Sara?

284
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,030
All clear.

285
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,840
All right,here we go.

286
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,860
That's far enough. that's far enough.

287
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,730
I'm sorry,Rita.

288
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,590
I promise everything is going to be okay.

289
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,260
Yeah,we're all friends here,Rita.

290
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,990
Don't worry about a thing.

291
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,290
You know,sending Feng after me almost cost me my life,and it did cost me my plan,

292
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,210
which is why you're here,Gretchen.

293
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,290
You're going to help me find a new buyer for Scylla.

294
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,560
You've been talking to Scofield and the boys,huh?

295
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,270
Yeah,how are they?

296
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,260
Good and pissed.

297
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,290
Yeah,where are they?

298
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,840
Gee,Don,I don't know,I'm not their mother.

299
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,850
You're nottheirmother,but...

300
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,760
She looks just like you.

301
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:20,600
Doesn't she? She's... got those big blue eyes.

302
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,690
I'm supposed to meet them in a half an hour.

303
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,500
Get ready to phone in a tip.

304
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,530
Where at? Where?

305
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,450
To perform the operation,Michael,that would require signatures

306
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,500
from about 20 different department heads.

307
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:03,250
The only way this is going to work is via freelancer-- off the books.

308
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,110
I should be thanking you.

309
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,240
Okay,because of what you've done,lives are going to be changed forever.

310
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,980
Scofield,have you reconsidered my offer?

311
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:26,480
If I get you Self and if I can get you Scylla,are you going to be able to hold up our deals?

312
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,730
How do you intend on doing that?

313
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,340
Well,that's what we're working on.

314
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,950
The feds-- they're here. We were set up.

315
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,550
Killing two federal agents ought to put you back on top of Death Row,Mr. Burrows.

316
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,010
We didn't kill anyone.

317
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,990
Self's behind this.

318
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,830
Don Self is a decorated agent and an honorable man.

319
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,360
Yeah.

320
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:54,200
You wouldn't be the first guy to sit in that chair and try to sell me a bill of goods.

321
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,380
Why weren't we halfway to Mexico by the time you worked things out?

322
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,020
You slipped up.

323
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,800
No.Because we were in the dark just as much as you were.

324
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,390
We know what happened,Burrows.

325
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,860
You're not putting this together.

326
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,460
Think about how much Scylla's worth.Think of the lengths that Self went to to keep this thing...

327
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,030
to keep this thing off the books.And us?

328
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,580
Us,of all people,pulling this job off.

329
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,680
Where are the bodies?

330
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,700
For five minutes,stop thinking about us,and focus on Self!

331
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,780
Why would we jeopardize our freedom?

332
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,860
It's the only thing we've ever cared about!

333
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,550
Where's Fernando?

334
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,230
He's on his way.Michael,look,I still have a friend in the Bureau we can reach out to.

335
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,510
Maybe she can make some calls,see where they're holding Linc.

336
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,410
Who are you calling?

337
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,610
- It's Scofield.  - All right.So answer it.

338
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,590
I should have put a bullet in your face when I had the chance.

339
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,660
I'm not the one who set you up,Michael.

340
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,500
Yeah?Who did?

341
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,600
You know,I meant what I said before,Michael.

342
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,220
I like your style.Okay?You're a smart guy.

343
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,610
Unfortunately for you,I'm just a little bit smarter.

344
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,370
Yeah?We'll see about that.

345
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,440
I heard Homeland made a surprise visit to the plaza,huh?

346
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,860
Look,I'm going to give you some parting advice.

347
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,560
Run.Okay,get your pals and just start running.

348
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,470
We gotta go.Michael,we gotta go.

349
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,270
I appreciate all your help,all right?

350
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,030
I'm going to sell Scylla now.

351
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,100
Don,you're not going anywhere.

352
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,880
Really?Okay.

353
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,500
Who's the buyer?

354
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,280
His name is Vikan.And he's not a buyer.He's a conduit.

355
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,660
A conduit to what?

356
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,420
We're not exactly moving heroin here.

357
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,200
It's a little bit more specialized.

358
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,680
There's about five people in the world who know what do with Scylla and are willing to pay for it.

359
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,150
All right.Let's go.

360
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,950
Bagwell's staying here.

361
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,430
You're going to find yourself captive in my negativity if you lay a hand on either one of them.

362
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,890
I warned you not to screw me over.

363
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,140
How could you?

364
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,190
I'll be back very,very soon.

365
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,540
And I promise you,that man is not going to hurt you.

366
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,300
How could you?

367
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,810
I'm going to fix this.

368
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,870
Wow,Gretchen,you're making friends left and right,huh?

369
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,110
Now move your ass.

370
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,150
We've accessed Self's E.I.D.

371
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,150
We've been able to get to files he tried to delete.

372
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,430
They're giving us a lot clearer picture of who he is and what he's been up to.

373
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,830
Honorable,huh?

374
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,670
What did you find out?

375
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,120
A name.Robert Walker.

376
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,030
The new identity Self is planning on using.

377
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,790
We found a Social Security number,a bank account in the Caymans,

378
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,910
credit cards and a flight itinerary out of the country for tomorrow morning.

379
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:13,750
So,first of all,we owe you an apology.

380
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,010
And,second,when we finally get our hands on him,it's going to be paramount to get your help.

381
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,160
- How?  - Your testimony,and the testimony of your brother

382
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,470
and the others against Self in exchange for full immunity.

383
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,100
- You walk away.  - We already had a deal.

384
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,890
If you walk now,there'll be no one left to tell the tale.

385
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,120
DHS needs you to cover its ass.

386
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,610
We can't spend our time chasing your friends.

387
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,840
They need to come in so we can work out the details.

388
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,440
What if they don't?

389
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,610
We got a whole bunch of trust issues.

390
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,740
Then,you'll all rot in a Supermax prison.

391
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,720
DHS is prepared to fly into the face of this thing or to bury it.

392
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,910
It's your choice,Mr. Burrows.

393
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,130
This is the best you're gonna do.

394
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,710
Michael

395
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,490
Linc,where are you?

396
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,310
In the warehouse.Put me on speaker.

397
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,780
Homeland knows Self screwed us.

398
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,890
What do we have?

399
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,440
They found a file he thought he deleted with an international bank account

400
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,300
and a one-way ticket out of here.

401
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,050
So it's over.

402
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,010
Yeah,well...

403
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,650
if we testify against Self,we get full immunity.

404
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,210
Immunity from what?We...

405
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,510
we did the job they hired us to do.

406
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,140
Michael,Senator Conrad Dallow.

407
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,250
We have evidence that supports your claims.

408
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,750
I'm giving you my word your troubles are over now.

409
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,590
Please,come in so we can end this.

410
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,530
Okay,um,I've decided...

411
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,100
rather,I think that,uh,we should hear the senator out.

412
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,040
And,uh,if everything goes south,then I do have a backup plan.

413
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,960
Sucre,I want you to go with Sara to the meeting place and get a lookout.

414
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,210
Alex and I are gonna make sure they don't bring any surprises

415
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,190
by doubling back to the warehouse and then following them to the rendezvous.

416
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,800
This is where we're meeting the senator.

417
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,590
All right?

418
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,180
We'll be there.

419
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,480
You know,my father spent most of his political life...

420
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,430
chasing justice.

421
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,340
It was sort of an obsession.

422
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:57,500
And my mother and I could never understand why he would so easily make other people's problems his own.

423
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,960
And I think it's why she left him.

424
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,730
And,Michael,you remind me more and more of him these days.

425
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,680
The way you put everybody else's problems before your own.

426
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,230
That said...

427
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:26,530
I want you to know that,if this meeting with Senator Dallow doesn't go the way you want it to,

428
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,610
you don't have to worry about you and me.

429
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,100
Nothing's...

430
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,680
nothing's gonna come between us.

431
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,450
Yeah.

432
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,460
And everything is gonna be okay,right?

433
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,330
You know,I've figured it out.

434
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,520
DHS wined and dined you in the beginning and promised you the world,

435
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,760
and then they ultimately settled on a broom closet next to some schmuck from the FAA.

436
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,500
And you said nil.

437
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,750
Gretchen,you have a real keen sense of perception.

438
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,150
It's amazing.

439
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:23,250
And this all ends with a three-story hut in Tahiti,right?

440
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,470
Flat-screen TV,a couple jet skis outside.

441
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,560
But what you're gonna find,Don,is that when the rush is over

442
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,750
and you're done patting yourself on the back and there's no one left to tell the story to,

443
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,580
you'll be just as alone as you are now.

444
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,130
That's who Don Self is.

445
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,910
Is that right?

446
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,050
You tell me.

447
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,040
Yeah.

448
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,910
Take out your gun.

449
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,830
What's going on?

450
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,520
You want a cut or not,Bagwell?Take out your gun.

451
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,410
Relax,Don.

452
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,520
All right.

453
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,290
Point it at her head.

454
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,980
Don

455
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,890
Pull back the hammer.

456
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,660
Don!

457
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,010
- Don.Don. - I want my money.

458
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,020
And I want to be on a plane by the end of today.

459
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,790
Otherwise,you and your family are gonna find out who the real Don Self is,you understand me?

460
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,040
- That's him. - Do you understand me?

461
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,840
We're set.

462
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,270
Okay,that's him.

463
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,150
Please.

464
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,440
I'll call you back.

465
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,960
1714 East Seventh Street.

466
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,360
This can't be right.

467
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,090
You sure this is what he wrote down?

468
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,280
That's what it says.

469
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,050
It's a parking lot.Why would Michael pick here?

470
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,780
I thought you and Michael were going to the warehouse.

471
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,460
Michael sent me ahead.

472
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,990
What's going on?Where is he?

473
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,240
He's safe-- Michael's safe.

474
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,130
We're not gonna be able to do this alone.

475
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,580
He's doing what he has to do,and we have to do our part.

476
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,020
Right now,that's getting on that bus and getting out of the city.

477
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,270
And we got to go now.

478
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,130
He just wants you both to be safe.

479
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,430
We got to go,we really got to go.

480
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,250
Where is Michael?

481
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,070
Mr. Scofield,Herb Stanton.

482
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,720
This is Senator Conrad Dallow.

483
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,440
On behalf of all Americans,I want to thank you for your service.

484
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,870
Save it.

485
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,010
I'm here to give my testimony,and then I'm leaving with my brother.

486
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,420
Right over here.

487
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,500
All right,gentlemen,tell us what you know.

488
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:39,620
Bus 34 with service to Bakersfield and Fresno now boarding in Terminal Five.

489
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,090
Are we really leaving?

490
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,580
You heard Mahone.This is what Michael wants.

491
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,840
Yeah,right.

492
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:58,260
Okay,but if the deal with Dallow is legit,there's no reason to run,right?

493
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,000
Michael's just covering the bases,making sure that we don't run into trouble again.

494
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,180
Yes,but if he's in trouble,he's going to need our help.

495
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,770
Well,maybe he thinks there's nothing left for us to do.

496
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,220
If we leave now,we're leaving him behind.

497
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,790
I didn't know Don Self had it in him.

498
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,220
Now that we know he's behind this,our situation's a lot worse.

499
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,490
We're not talking about our careers anymore.

500
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,480
We're talking about real jail time.

501
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:02,720
We get 15 years just for conducting an unauthorized operation without Congressional approval.

502
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,380
Or not.

503
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,750
This doesn't have to be about containment anymore.

504
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,540
It could be about excision.

505
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,820
You all right with that,Senator?

506
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,070
Then they all go.

507
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,100
Where are the others?

508
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,710
- Mahone,Sucre,Tancredi.  - They're not coming.

509
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,200
Linc and I will testify,but the others...

510
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,000
Well,we all get immunity.Those are the terms.

511
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,490
Our testimony alone will put Self away.

512
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:52,480
Gentleman,we can't have the others running around while we're trying to wrap this up.

513
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,980
Can we call 'em?Can we get 'em here?

514
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,200
The deal was for all of you.

515
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,650
Thosewere the terms.

516
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,570
Without everybody,this is no deal.

517
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,160
Listen,pal,you're gonna get what you want,all right?

518
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,520
Are you gonna call them or not?

519
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,510
Hmm,there never was a deal,was there,Senator?

520
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:23,120
I wish I could give you a better answer,Michael,but Don Self left a lot of rough edges.

521
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,580
We have to smooth them out.

522
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,090
You want to tell me where they are?

523
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,530
It ain't gonna happen.

524
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,340
I can get you self.

525
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,130
I can still get you scylla.

526
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,710
Scylla?

527
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,220
Oh,we're past scylla.

528
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,350
Between getting it back and ending this now,the choice is simple.

529
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,600
You wanted your supermax answer,you got it,richard.

530
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,880
Now time to go.

531
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,220
Escort mr. Sooter out.

532
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,710
I'm gonna count to five.

533
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,400
One,two,three...

534
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,190
you've got an appointment with the general.

535
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,450
Here you go.

536
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,270
Wait right here.

537
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,440
Been a long time,gretchen.

538
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,690
No longer working for the general?

539
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,520
Correct.

540
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,190
Who's he?

541
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,330
I'm the guy that's holding scylla.

542
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,150
You interested?

543
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,480
Well,the general has offered a rewa for anyone who can return scylla along

544
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,250
with the heads of the transgressors.

545
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,430
I appreciate you allowing me the opportunity to kick the general in the teeth.

546
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,900
Can I see?

547
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,800
All of you.

548
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,530
- Sooter,please,I can give you cover.  - Save it!

549
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,720
Save it,senator,save it.

550
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,270
The general specifically asked that I bring you in alive.Just move.

551
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,690
You were going to kill us,senator.

552
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,530
It was stanton who made that call.

553
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,420
Look,what was extremely complicated 30 seconds ago is not so now.

554
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,700
There were six people who knew about this operation.

555
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,800
Two of them are still alive.One is now on the run-- and I'm the other.

556
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,750
And I'm not saying a word.

557
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,420
You're not getting off that easy,senator.

558
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,850
You are going to help us.

559
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:07,330
There is a folder in that briefcase on the conference table.

560
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,170
It contains the last remnants of this operation.

561
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:16,100
Once you dispose of it none of this ever existed.

562
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,590
That's the saving grace of a covert operation.

563
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,650
If you want...

564
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,970
it never happened.

565
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,320
I'm going to walk away now.

566
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,090
Catch a flight.

567
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,340
Maybe see my wife before she goes to bed.

568
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,880
I only hope I don't catch a bullet in the back on my way out.

569
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,520
I'm really very sorry,gentlemen.

570
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,880
We tried.

571
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,910
We tried.

572
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,000
Let him go.Linc,let him go.

573
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,160
Don't.

574
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,360
Let him go.

575
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,060
We running now?

576
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,040
I will kill you myself the next time you do something like that.

577
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,110
Where's mahone?

578
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,670
He's gone.

579
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,430
Well,we can do business when you get the rest of scylla.

580
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,570
What are you talking about?

581
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,380
It's incomplete.

582
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,590
Incom...Wha-- who is this clown?

583
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,490
- Clown? - Yeah,clown.

584
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,960
There's a piece missing,slick.

585
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,700
Look.Here.

586
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,470
Hello,don.

587
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,320
I believe you have something that belongs to me.

588
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,560
Come and get it.

589
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


590
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000




9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
