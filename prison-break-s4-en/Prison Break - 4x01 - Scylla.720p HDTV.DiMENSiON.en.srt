1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,140
My name is michael scofield.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,640
I am a fugitive.

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,540
Three weeks ago, I was
incarcerated in a panamanian prison.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,030
While I was there, I was
approached by the company...

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,570
a corrupt organization involved in
all levels of industry and government.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,490
They gave me two options:

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,550
Break one of their men-- james
whistler-- out of that prison...

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,090
or they would kill the only woman
I ever loved-- dr. Sara tancredi.

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,970
I held up my end and broke whistler out.

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,620
The company...

11
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,320
they killed sara anyway.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,750
I don't know why the company
wanted james whistler out of prison,

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,280
but I've tracked him
here to los angeles.

14
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,380
He's with an agent I
know only as gretchen...

15
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,540
the same agent who murdered sara.

16
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,130
It ends today.

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,000
I will seek the justice that I
now know the system cannot provide.

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,160
So if you're reading this letter,
you'll know I died avenging sara's death.

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,790
<font color="#ffff00">Prison
Break Season04 Episode01</font>

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,640
You get the data card.

21
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,870
We drop it off in the racing form,
and we get the hell out of there.

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,690
Who's the contact we're leaving it for?

23
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,580
The company wants the card back, period.

24
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,570
All you need to worry about is getting
this rig the hell out of there in a hurry.

25
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,420
Oh, I'll be getting it out of
there. Don't you worry about that.

26
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,590
You worry about getting your
ass back in that seat in time.

27
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,670
If you pull this off, you can come up to my room
later and the word "no" won't be in my vocabulary.

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,570
Just make sure we get paid.

29
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,790
in and out.

30
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,370
Good to see you again.

31
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,240
You, too.

32
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,370
Didn't hear from you for a while.

33
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,400
Started to wonder if you
were still interested.

34
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,900
I am, very much so.

35
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,620
Well, I needed to
approach this carefully.

36
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,250
I'm sure you understand.

37
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,020
Who you buying it for?

38
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,370
A competitor? A foreign country?

39
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,750
Jason, you know I can't get into that.

40
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,550
Now, we've been
negotiating this for months.

41
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,840
I've jumped through all your hoops.

42
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,770
I've agreed to meet you here.

43
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,240
Do you want to sell
the card to me or not?

44
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,420
Be right back.

45
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,610
that's a lot of secrets on
a little piece of plastic.

46
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,050
Let me give you a
little bit of advice--

47
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,000
and this is on the house--
watch your step with that thing.

48
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,310
The company will do
anything to get it back.

49
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,640
Don't I know it.

50
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,560
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you doing? We got to get out of here.

51
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,010
I need to hide the gun.

52
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,640
Take the gun with you!

53
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,190
Where is she?

54
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,870
Michael, you don't understand.

55
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,790
Call gretchen, get her in here now.

56
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,470
You have to trust me.

57
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,090
I'm not your enemy, michael.

58
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,130
James.

59
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,650
We need to leave.

60
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,900
You know, despite everything...

61
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,600
if sara could weigh in right now,
she'd tell me not to kill you.

62
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,660
That's the kind of person she was.

63
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,060
That's the kind of
person you took from me.

64
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,970
James, didn't you tell him?

65
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,850
- He walked in five...
- shut up!

66
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,100
Gretchen, look at me.

67
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,720
- This is for sara.
- I never killed sara.

68
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,890
I wouldn't expect someone like
you to take this with dignity.

69
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,440
I swear to god she's alive.

70
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,150
Don'T. Don't insult me
and don't insult her.

71
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,350
She escaped.

72
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,440
We knew if you found out we
wouldn't have any leverage.

73
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,330
I fabricated the whole thing.

74
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,010
My brother saw...

75
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,870
a head in a box! From a cadaver.

76
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,900
You ask lincoln what he really saw.

77
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,990
Listen to her, michael.

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,640
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying to you.

79
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,190
Lincoln bought it, you
bought it, it worked.

80
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,820
Michael.

81
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,070
Then where is she?

82
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,260
I'll tell you when we get outside.

83
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,980
Right now, we need to get out of here.

84
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,700
they found the bodies.

85
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,520
Give me the gun.

86
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,540
- She's lying.
- Is she?

87
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,870
If you pull that trigger,
you'll never know.

88
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,150
- Kill him, james.
- Shut up.

89
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,150
Where is she? Where is sara?

90
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,140
Michael, if you don't give me that
gun, I'm going to shoot you in the head.

91
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,310
let's go.

92
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,690
We got a double homicide
at the roosevelt hotel.

93
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,890
sara.

94
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:31,200
Do you know the difference between a perfectly
executed operation and a failed mission?

95
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,440
Sir?

96
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,480
It's small unit leadership.

97
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,620
The allies spent two and a half years
planning the invasion of normandy,

98
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,690
but on d-day it came down to a
handful of men on a strip of beach

99
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,290
to decide the fate of the world.

100
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,210
What I'm getting at, gretchen,

101
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,170
is even the best plan is only as good as
the moving parts on the ground executing it.

102
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,580
General, we got your
card-- what's the problem?

103
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,500
We have nothing. It's a duplicate.

104
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,710
- Almost flawless, but a duplicate.
- That's impossible. I saw...

105
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,560
you know how important the retrieval
of this card is to me, gretchen.

106
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,800
You know that this is a security breach that could
have catastrophic ramifications for the company.

107
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,340
The only thing I can think of...

108
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,690
there was a blind spot when
whistler was hitting the target.

109
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,920
Maybe he made a duplicate
and he still has the original.

110
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,980
You hired him.

111
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,740
You kept him at the tip of the spear.

112
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,600
You insisted that we
get him out of sona.

113
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,030
We had to.

114
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,030
He had already made
contact with the target.

115
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,910
At that point, it was
him or no one, sir.

116
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,750
What's your stake in all of this?

117
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,550
I had nothing to do with it. Whistler
acted on his own. I swear to you.

118
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,870
General, I can fix this.

119
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,290
You trained me.

120
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,510
Not well enough, apparently.

121
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,180
You.........

122
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,870
Please.

123
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,430
I have a bank account in dubai left over
from a slush fund from cobra ii. It's yours.

124
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,110
No, please, please...

125
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,220
<i>PANAMA CITY,PANANA</i>

126
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,730
hello.

127
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,490
Hey, it's me.

128
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,780
Where are you, man?

129
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,310
Los angeles.

130
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,490
- You okay, michael?
- No, I'm, I'm safe.

131
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,020
Thank god, thank god.

132
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,870
How's lj and sofia?

133
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,370
Yeah, they're, um...

134
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,710
I'm staring at them right
now in fact. They're fine.

135
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,430
You hear about sona?

136
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,560
What about it?

137
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,180
Burned down three days back.
The inmates-- they rioted.

138
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,940
No sign of bellick, t-bag, or sucre.

139
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,120
Sucre?

140
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,810
He got popped--
I don't know how.

141
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,440
I mean, the papers listed the names of the
inmates, and he was in there when it went down.

142
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,710
I found whistler and gretchen...

143
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,450
and, uh...

144
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,800
gretchen said...

145
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,920
she said sara is still alive.

146
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,800
What did you see, linc?

147
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,660
What do you mean what
did I see, michael?

148
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,290
I need you to tell me
exactly what you saw.

149
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,740
Michael, sara's gone.

150
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,080
Well, you said it was in a
garage, right? So it was dark.

151
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,940
Yeah, it was dark.

152
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,160
But if you're asking me if I picked up the head
to check to see if it was sara, no, michael, I-I...

153
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,690
lj said he...

154
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,690
he only heard them kill sara, right?

155
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,570
You just got to come back,
please. Come back. Let's just...

156
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,410
let's just start a new life.

157
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,610
Tell sofia I said hi. And tell lj...

158
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,010
tell him his uncle loves him.

159
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,300
Michael, don't do this, please.

160
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,800
<i>ARIZONA DESERT 5 MILES FROM....</i>

161
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,690
out, out!

162
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,410
You need some better
ventilation back there, amigo.

163
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,910
¿Que? Want to translate that?

164
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,280
Don't worry about it. Gracias.

165
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,680
Where's your mom?

166
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,810
She'll be here.

167
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,650
What do you mean she'll be here? We're-we're
running out of time. I got to be up there.

168
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,860
Don't worry. My mom
wouldn't let me down.

169
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,090
At least, she hasn't yet.

170
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,410
bradley! Over here!

171
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,740
Mom! Mom! I told you!

172
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,360
Don't worry, you'll make it there!

173
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,340
- What is it called?
- Europeangoldfinch. Net.

174
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,120
It's what we can all use to communicate.

175
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,840
MS:I have info on
Sara.Behind the Santa....

176
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,350
michael.

177
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,050
Don't worry, I'm alone.

178
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,580
It's good to see you.

179
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,620
So where's your new best friend?

180
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,560
Well...

181
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,880
I don't know about that, but
whistler's not who you think he is.

182
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,130
We're working together
against the company.

183
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,550
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

184
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,600
And what about gretchen?
She working with you?

185
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,870
He needed her to further his plan.

186
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,820
Look, if the guy was company, he'd have shot you
dead back at that conference like she wanted him to.

187
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,620
Do you have any information
about sara or not?

188
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,080
Let's go somewhere a
little more private.

189
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,840
I want you to tell me right now.

190
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,450
I want you to tell me
right now, right here!

191
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,770
Or we can get gretchen on the phone.

192
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,410
Gretchen's dead.

193
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,290
She never showed up.

194
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,310
Come and talk to me, please.

195
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,640
Whistler and I were at that
conference to get a data card.

196
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,770
It's like the company's black book.

197
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,880
And it lists all their
agents, all their operations.

198
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,190
They refer to it as "scylla."

199
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,010
Whistler's got it.

200
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,690
Alex, talk to me about sara.

201
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,870
That's all I care about.

202
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,770
I understand that. I want nothing more
than to get home to my wife and my son.

203
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,550
But that's not gonna happen for either of us
with the company out there trying to kill us.

204
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,420
You don't know anything
about sara, do you?

205
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,930
Whistler does. He tells me he does.

206
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,490
And he wants to tell you.

207
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
- But he wants something in return.
- What? What does he want from me?

208
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,480
To talk to you.

209
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
I'm sorry about all
that the other night.

210
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,660
If i had more time,I would've
explained myself better.

211
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,670
Sure.

212
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,870
What are we doing here?

213
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,240
Alex told you about scylla?

214
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,200
Yes.

215
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,810
I have it.

216
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,510
There's one last step involved
in order to read the data.

217
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,080
And that step involves breaking
into a secured structure.

218
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,710
So now you need my help.

219
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,580
Yeah.

220
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,400
My book,the bird book,the one I
lost in sona contained information

221
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,800
that would've helped facilitate the break-in,but
it can still be accomplished,with your help.

222
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,270
Where's sara?

223
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:39,520
The only thing I know for sure,a week
ago,some information came through the wire.

224
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,010
Sara may have bought a
bus ticket in santa fe.

225
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,650
Headed where?

226
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,290
Chicago.

227
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,390
Michael,if sara's out there,she's
not safe-- none of us are.

228
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,100
The company knows we still have the original
card,and that's why gretchen was the first to go.

229
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,200
I think we're done here.

230
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,950
We...

231
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,550
have a chance for once to get scylla to
people that want to take the company down.

232
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,650
I don't want to run anymore.

233
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,990
We won't have to run anymore.

234
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,030
I spent the last month thinking sara
was dead and that it was my fault.

235
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,430
If she's out there,I'm gonna find her.

236
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,270
That's all I care about.

237
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,960
This can be done within a week.

238
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,560
Less.

239
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,730
At least let me show you...

240
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,510
Oh,I'm gonna miss these gams,girl.

241
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,030
don't go.

242
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,380
this ain't no home for
a white boy from alabama.

243
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,440
they're here,señor.

244
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,440
The bags are packed.

245
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,380
you kept your word to me.

246
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,740
You're the first that's
ever done that.Gracias.

247
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,390
Why must you go after this man?

248
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,870
You could choose not to.

249
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,410
Where I come from,there's
something called a blood feud.

250
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,990
Comprende?

251
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,670
Yes.

252
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,820
Michael scofield left me for dead
one too many times,as it turns out.

253
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,360
What is spanish for "little angel"?

254
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,760
Angelita.

255
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,580
Adios,angelita.

256
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,280
Is this legit?

257
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,120
Oh,s?señor.

258
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:11,130
For the money you're
paying,first class,all the way.

259
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,170
So these are coyotes one could trust.

260
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,720
S?señor.

261
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,890
Vamanos.

262
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,920
as you've seen,what you're
entering into is quite serious.

263
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,350
M I realize that.

264
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,190
You're responsible for this now.

265
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,640
You have nothing to worry about.

266
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,070
We'll talk sooN.

267
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,310
it's time to clean up now.

268
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,840
Thoroughly.

269
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:09,910
Everyone who was close to
whistler: Scofield,mahone,burrows.

270
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,400
Burrows is still in panama.

271
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,000
Clean up.

272
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,270
hellO.

273
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,980
Hi,pam.

274
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,560
Where...

275
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,090
where are you?

276
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
Uh,you know.

277
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,820
in the middle of it,as usual.

278
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,420
Panama still?

279
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,160
No.

280
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,460
No.

281
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,330
Are you okay?

282
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,570
Definitely.

283
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,000
Are you?

284
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,740
Yes.

285
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,660
And cameron?

286
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,170
He's fine.

287
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:02,450
I have to tell you,pam,you know,I had
a plan for all of us to be together.

288
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,770
And...

289
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,820
I'm not gonna stop working on it.

290
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,770
Why do you need a plan if
you want to be with someone?

291
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,980
You just be with them.

292
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,650
don't say that unless you mean it.

293
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,230
'Cause I'll turn this world
upside down to get back to you.

294
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,600
So don't say it unless you mean it.

295
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,570
I mean it.

296
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,470
Okay.

297
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,440
Come on,babe.

298
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,130
I-I hate plantains,you know that.

299
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,910
I try your chili burger.

300
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,900
Chili-chili burger?

301
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,750
You loved the chili burger.

302
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,180
Okay,I'm gonna make them
with my mom's special recipe.

303
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,520
Your mom's special recipe?

304
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,640
You'll love it.

305
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,800
- Really?
- Yeah!

306
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,990
It's delicious.

307
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,770
****

308
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,570
Let's get out of here.

309
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,410
Drop 'em.

310
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,430
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.

311
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,070
Lj.

312
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,270
- Yep
- Let's go

313
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,900
- Lincoln
- Come with me

314
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,080
What's going on?

315
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,170
Dad

316
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,570
We're safe now.

317
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,790
- Relax.
- No.

318
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,320
I saw someone.

319
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,550
Looks like company,I'm sure of it.

320
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,230
Let's just go,okay?

321
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,650
Let's go.

322
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,350
We'll-we'll be fine.

323
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,680
- All right,all right.
- Yeah.

324
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,320
Get back.

325
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,340
dad!

326
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,000
dad,we have to run.

327
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,320
Go.

328
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,590
Get out of here.

329
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,480
Run!

330
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,180
Lincoln!

331
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,390
Lincoln!

332
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,040
I'm looking for alex.

333
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,560
I don't know where he is.

334
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,860
No?

335
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,860
No.

336
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,150
Uh,we've been divorced
for almost two years now.

337
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,260
We haven't had contact in months.

338
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,740
I would think that might change
now that he's back in the U.S.

339
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,020
I am so sick of you
people-- what are you a fed?

340
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,860
-
- Thinking that you can keep on harassing...

341
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,380
I'm not with the government,pam.

342
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,330
Mom,could you come here?

343
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,370
We're done talking...

344
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,430
bruce bennett.

345
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,630
Do you know who this is?

346
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,880
I do.

347
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,970
I'm looking for sara,and right now,you're the
only person I can think of who can help me.

348
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,590
Hold on.

349
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,320
Where are you?

350
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,500
Back in chicago.

351
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,880
Have you heard from her?

352
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,240
Meet me in front of the
drake hotel in a half hour.

353
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,060
Please just tell me...

354
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,590
is she alive?

355
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,500
Are you michael scofield?

356
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:19,310
Are you michael scofield?

357
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,650
Yes,I am.

358
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,130
Hands on your head.

359
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,510
Michael scofield.

360
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,650
Special agent don
self,homeland security.

361
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,390
Were you there when
james whistler was killed?

362
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,890
I didn't kill him.

363
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,160
I know you didn'T.

364
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:57,730
He was an independent contractor who
worked for the company for about ten years.

365
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,300
He was assigned to retrieve
scylla once it went missing.

366
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,210
Do you know what scylla is?

367
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,580
It's the company's little black book.

368
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,500
So he was going to make a
copy of it and give it to me.

369
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,590
What do you want from me?

370
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,570
You're looking at major time.

371
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,290
You know that,right?

372
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,560
So how would you like to
walk away from it all...

373
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,660
- not do a day?
- In exchange for...

374
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,630
Scylla.

375
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,250
All right.

376
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:34,590
Sara tancredi,last seen in panama,if you
help me find her,maybe we've got a deal.

377
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,720
I'm sorry,she's not my
department,scylla is.

378
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,530
Then go find it yourself.

379
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,860
It seems to me,the U.S.Government
should have a little more reach

380
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,810
than someone who's
looking at major time.

381
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,400
To perform the operation,michael,

382
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,600
that would require signatures from
about 20 different department heads.

383
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,600
Do you want to bet at least
one of them is company?

384
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,520
The only way this is going to work
is via freelancer,off the books.

385
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,540
It sounds complicated.

386
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,500
I'll take a pass.

387
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,670
I'm giving you an opportunity
to avoid 15 years in jail,

388
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,130
not to mention the time
that your brother's facing.

389
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,980
What are you talking about?

390
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,880
The company tried to
take him out in panama.

391
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,760
He,um...

392
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,600
reacted,apparently.

393
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,030
But I just made a deal with the
panamanian authorities for him

394
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,870
to serve out his time in the U.S.

395
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,160
He should be touching
ground any time now.

396
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,000
you recognize this handwriting?

397
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,630
This is your father'S.

398
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,400
He spent the last two years of his
life going after this very thing.

399
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,590
Do you believe in fate,michael?

400
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,790
I think I'd like to talk to my brother.

401
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,360
Oh,no.

402
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,820
oh,no.

403
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,800
what's going...

404
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,080
Stop!

405
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,210
Stop!

406
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,180
You don't want to go in there.

407
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,270
You don't want to go in there.

408
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

409
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,580
god,she'S...

410
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,600
lilah maria sucre.

411
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,340
She gave her my name?

412
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,540
Soy tu papa.

413
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,950
You're setting me up?

414
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,700
Sucre,you can't keep
bringing maricruz down.

415
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,480
You can't do this to her anymore.

416
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,590
- It's OK.
- Wait.

417
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,590
Don'T...

418
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,410
sucre,don'T...

419
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,600
go!Go!

420
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,900
Oh,boy.

421
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,900
we're screwed.

422
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,020
you know why scofield gets all
twisted up when he's around me?

423
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,820
we're the same,and he
just can't stand it.

424
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,520
Drives his ass crazy.

425
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,450
We got the same brilliant mind,the
same natural-born leader tendency,

426
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,610
the same one-in-a-million-type
charisma,yes?

427
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,070
He just gonna look down his nose at me?

428
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,760
how you gonna find him?

429
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,260
This.

430
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,820
You're both into birds?

431
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,380
No,no.

432
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,920
It's either gonna take
me to him,or he to me.

433
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,140
I just know it.

434
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,580
If I was you,I'd forget
about this scofield.

435
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,480
You have plenty of money.See?I mean...

436
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,840
how much money you have in that bag?

437
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,000
Why don't you just mind
your own beeswax,huh?

438
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,050
You just keep pointing this
jalopy northbound,all right?

439
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,450
Get me back to the land 'o cotton.

440
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,170
Of course.

441
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,960
Ready.

442
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,700
only a few people in government
will know of the operation.

443
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,800
It has to stay that way,
or people's lives will be in danger, mine included.

444
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,100
Taking down the company sounds
a little bigger than a two-man job, no?

445
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,500
I'm going to get you help.

446
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,300
I thought you said, you couldn't trust anybody.

447
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,900
Yeah, but maybe you can.

448
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,600
All right, two of your cohorts-
fernando sucre, and brad bellick were arrested,

449
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,900
they're both facing time,

450
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,300
and alexander mahone is in a colorado jail cell.

451
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,500
Good, let him sit there.

452
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,700
You're going to need mahone
if you want to make this happen.

453
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,500
He was working with whistler.

454
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,400
And you'll have me. Okay?

455
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,900
Whatever you need, I'll provide.

456
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,200
Whistler also said something about a second step,
something about a break-in.

457
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,100
Yeah, the card has all the data on it,
but it's encrypted.

458
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,375
Once you get your hands on it,

459
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:43,325
you're going to need to find a way to
break into the company's headquarters.

460
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,400
It's the only way to unlock what's on the card.

461
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,300
- Where's the building?
- L.A.

462
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,800
- Where in L.A.?
- I don't know.

463
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,500
So, we've got a data card, which could be anywhere,

464
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,900
and we've got to break into a building,
the location of which has yet to be determined.

465
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,300
Simple enough.

466
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,500
You've broken out of two penitentiaries.

467
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm thinking, uh, breaking into a building
isn't too far outside your wheelhouse.

468
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,600
How do you know our dad?

469
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,000
He heard from contacts that I could be trusted.

470
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,200
- Your father was a good man.
- Why now?

471
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,900
Look, I've been going after
the company for five years. Okay?

472
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,500
When whistler was killed yesterday, the plug
was going to be pulled on the entire operation.

473
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,800
But, uh... I convinced my superiors
to give it one more chance.

474
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,200
- So this is like job security for you?
- What's that?

475
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,600
Well, when we go out there and risk our necks,
you can collect your pension.

476
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,100
No, no, no, lincoln.

477
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,700
Okay, some people still care about their job.

478
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,500
Some people still fight for this country.

479
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,100
Maybe you've been a little too distracted boosting
car stereos and breaking heads to remember that.

480
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,500
If we do this deal, after it's done,

481
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,400
you can look for sara...if she's alive.

482
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,900
If we take this deal, we'll both be dead
long before I get the chance, linc.

483
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,200
you guys must have some big-time friends.

484
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,900
What are you talking about?

485
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,700
Somebody just posted a significant amount
of bail for both of you.

486
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,900
Who?

487
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,100
I don't know, but they're outside.

488
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,900
You're free to go.

489
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,600
Here, take your dad's file.
My number's inside.

490
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,400
- We ain't doing this.
- Just take it anyway.

491
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,300
This file, it means nothing to me anymore.

492
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,300
Bruce bennett.

493
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,500
Let's go for a drive.

494
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,600
Thanks.

495
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,600
I thought I'd never see you again.

496
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,000
I have something for you.

497
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,200
Okay.

498
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,500
You left this behind.

499
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,200
is that what this is about?

500
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,700
You just getting me my rose back?

501
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Yeah. I guess I'm done now. I can retire.

502
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,200
how much time are you looking at?

503
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
They're saying 15 years.

504
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I have to find out for sure.

505
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,000
I heard lincoln say something about a deal.

506
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,900
No jail time.

507
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,100
In exchange for taking down the company.

508
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,200
How?

509
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,500
Exactly.

510
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,300
I love you.

511
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,300
That's all I know right now.

512
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,400
Will you not yield to the immortal gods?

513
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,100
That nightmare cannot die. Eternal evil itself.

514
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
There is no fighting her, no.

515
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,100
No power that can fight her.

516
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,800
Now, listen to me- it's up to you now.

517
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,600
All that avails is flight.

518
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,900
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

519
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,700
6ant to talk about it?

521
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,800
it's not your fault. It's not.

522
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Tell me what happened.

523
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,800
It's just the company.

524
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,200
It's just what they do.

525
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,700
It wasn't just me.
God, it was you and lj and-and lincoln.

526
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,500
And they won't stop,

527
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and I don't know how to deal with that.

528
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,400
Hey, come here.

529
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Come here. Come here.

530
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,400
let's go!

531
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,000
are you okay?

532
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,000
I can't believe they found us so fast.

533
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,400
Should I call... should I call bruce
and-and get some place safe?

534
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,100
No place is safe.

535
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,700
They're not gonna stop unless we stop them. Linc?

536
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,200
You thinking what I'm thinking?

537
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,700
Let's end this.
But I'm not gonna leave you behind again.

538
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,200
yeah?

539
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,800
We're in.

540
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,800
- Hey
- Hey, papi.

541
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,300
linc.

542
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,800
I can't tell you how grateful
I am for you including me.

543
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,900
Well, sucre vouched for you, bellick.

544
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,800
He said you came through for him down in panama.

545
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,500
- Alex?
- Michael.

546
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,800
- You ready for this?
- Yeah. I am.

547
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,200
So I hear whistler's bird book has
details about what we need to steal.

548
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,100
- Yeah.
- You know who's got it, right?

549
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,000
please. We'll die out here.

550
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,400
Thanks for the cash, gringo.

551
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,700
First class all the way.

552
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Do we have any idea where t-bag is?

553
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,300
That snake could be anywhere.

554
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,700
When we're in L.A., We can think like convicts,
we just can't act like them.

555
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,300
If we do, we're done.

556
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,700
It goes without saying-
this is your last chance to back out,

557
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,600
'cause first on the list of things
I cannot guarantee you is your safety.

558
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,100
We're all a long way from where this started.

559
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,800
But what I can guarantee you
is that if we do this thing right,

560
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,000
we'll be close to where it ends.

561
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,500
Freedom. Finally.

562
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,800
You two- let's go.

563
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,000
Hey, mike?

564
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,900
What about sara?

565
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,000
Sara's in.

566
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,300
All right, we're heading out tomorrow.

567
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,000
I have to finalize a few things before we go.

568
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,800
No games and no stunts.

569
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,600
Otherwise, I promise, you're gonna see
a whole different side of me.

570
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,100
Likewise.

571
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,400
Fake ids. It's a good start,

572
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,100
but there are some things you can't fake,

573
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,800
and there are some things you can't hide.

574
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,000
Know what I mean?

575
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,400
How high is your threshold for pain?

576
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,100
You sure you don't want a sedativ

577
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,200
we're gonna go into the night.

578
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,300
- how do you feel?
- Lighter somehow.

579
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,900
Look, I don't know how we're gonna take them down.

580
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,800
I don't even know who they are,
but I do know one thing-

581
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,400
the company's gonna pay for what they did to you.

582
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,800
Let's go.

583
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,100
You sure you're up for this?

584
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,000
If we can do it together, um... yeah.

585
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,600
- ok.
- Absolutely.

586
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,900
A c-130? What do they want...
want us to parachute out of this thing?

587
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,900
This guy called in a favor to the air force.

588
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,700
It's not like we can be
flying commercial, you know?

589
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,000
If you're successful with obtaining scylla,
you'll not only avoid jail time,

590
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,100
but you can take great pride in knowing you

591
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,000
helped dismantle this country's greatest
threat to its own democracy.

592
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,700
If you're killed while doing so,
a proper funeral will be provided.

593
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,300
But if you try to escape, you will have no funeral.

594
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,700
You will have nothing,

595
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,100
and you will be apprehended
and buried where we find you.

596
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,000
I sincerely hope we understand each other.

597
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,000
You better hold up your end of the deal.

598
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,900
Let's go!
