1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,717
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:07,116
If Scylla was like a pizza,
all we got's a slice.

3
00:00:07,622 --> 00:00:10,318
So Scylla's in one card. It's six.

4
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:13,786
- How long has it been happening?
- No big deal.

5
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:15,053
It was when you were 13.

6
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:17,254
- Michael told you about Mom?
- No.

7
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:20,958
As a kid, she got nosebleeds.
In her 30s, they started up again.

8
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:23,069
How old was your mom
when she passed away?

9
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:26,035
Thirty-one. Michael's just turning 31.

10
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:28,634
Who's that?

11
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,743
That's the man who killed my son.

12
00:00:32,747 --> 00:00:34,180
Yes.

13
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:45,658
It's like a digital black hole that
swallows up electronic data within 10 feet.

14
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:49,723
- Mr. Glenn.
- We got a problem.

15
00:00:50,698 --> 00:00:54,031
- What's that?
- A battery pack for a video game console.

16
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:57,003
You'll need to buy a new one.

17
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:02,843
Scylla. Get it to me by tomorrow
and you will receive 50 percent of your fee.

18
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,376
Two days, 25 percent.

19
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:07,946
Three days,
I shoot you through the brain.

20
00:01:12,587 --> 00:01:13,611
Who is this?

21
00:01:14,288 --> 00:01:15,619
Hello, Michael.

22
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:32,066
You know what? If Crab ever
throws a psycho at us like this again...

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,434
...l'm gonna kill him.

24
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:35,974
If we don't get this psycho,
Crab's gonna kill us.

25
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:37,440
Just have the burner ready.

26
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:40,275
Got it covered.

27
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:44,884
After this job, I'm done, man.

28
00:01:45,052 --> 00:01:46,610
I can't do this anymore.

29
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:49,479
What do you think Crab'll say?

30
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:51,625
I don't care what Crab says about that.

31
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:55,259
How can I be a good father
if I'm always in prison?

32
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:58,125
I missed out on my kid's childhood.

33
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,961
I'm not gonna miss out on
him becoming a man.

34
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:04,905
Hey, not for nothing,
but this plan is crazy, even for you.

35
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:07,597
- You sure this is the only way?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:13,276
Hey, look. He's coming out.
He's got the keys.

37
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:16,475
Let's buckle up.

38
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:46,638
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!

39
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:01,218
- You're welcome.
- Let's go.

40
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:13,302
So wait a minute,
this is your brilliant plan?

41
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:15,305
A kamikaze mission
on the General's car?

42
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:19,640
Hey, now that that device is gone,
your opinion doesn't matter.

43
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,247
Now shut up and pump.

44
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,985
We know the General travels light.
One limo and a couple guards.

45
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:28,917
It ain't the guards, what I'm worried about.
It's the crash.

46
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,990
Look, I never said
this was gonna be easy.

47
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,773
Just relax.

48
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:53,103
First off, Panama was a job.

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,508
Some other time.

50
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:57,014
- What do you want with Scylla?
- That's my business.

51
00:03:57,184 --> 00:04:00,085
We're not in Panama anymore.
And I'm not behind a fence.

52
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:02,188
So again, what do you want with Scylla?

53
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:03,516
Same thing you want.

54
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:05,420
- Bring down the Company.
- Great.

55
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,788
Then give me those missing pages
and disappear.

56
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:08,986
I'd love to.

57
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:12,496
Remember that day that Roosevelt
and Whistler made off with Lief's card?

58
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,602
Who do you think took the fall for that?
Her name's at the top of the same hit list.

59
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:20,232
I don't know what arrangement you have,
but I need traveling money.

60
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:21,466
Talk about that later.

61
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:24,202
Talk about the kind of scum
you'll put on the payroll.

62
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:27,779
Give me a way to do it without her
and we'll do it. We need the pages.

63
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:31,649
It's a package deal.

64
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:33,480
Are we partners?

65
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:38,449
Partners.

66
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:52,063
I barely dropped the nickel
in the slots when this guy...

67
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:56,300
- We ought to blanket-party your ass.
- Where's the device and can it be salvaged?

68
00:04:56,477 --> 00:04:58,240
Tell him.

69
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:02,846
Pit boss walked off with it.

70
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:07,075
Okay. Well, we're gonna call this
your early retirement.

71
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:10,485
You can either sit on your cot
and ride out the rest of this thing...

72
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:14,116
...or I call Agent Self and you ride out
the rest of your prison sentence.

73
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:15,819
Your choice.

74
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:33,371
I need to talk to you.

75
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:39,648
So your brother told me
about your nosebleeds.

76
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,844
And about your mom.

77
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:43,319
- That wasn't his place.
- To be worried about you?

78
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:46,153
When Mom got sick,
Linc was at the hospital every day...

79
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:48,659
...holding her hand, watching her die.

80
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:50,194
And he was 13.

81
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:52,832
It changed him.
It made him overprotective.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,798
Now he's jumping to wrong conclusions,
for the wrong reasons.

83
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,337
And it's over nothing, because I'm fine.

84
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:02,170
You don't look fine.

85
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:05,244
Well...

86
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:08,706
...maybe that's because there's something
I have to tell you.

87
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:13,150
Gretchen's alive.

88
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:57,796
She's working with T-Bag.

89
00:06:57,965 --> 00:07:00,365
They have several pages
from Whistler's Bird Book...

90
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,263
...and they want in on Scylla.

91
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:06,231
Self is cutting them a deal as we speak.

92
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:12,544
Self knows that they have
their own agenda, but so do we.

93
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:14,442
As soon as we get those pages back...

94
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:16,947
...Gretchen and T-Bag
are gonna pay for everything.

95
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:20,143
They're gonna get exactly
what's coming to them.

96
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:26,882
Okay.

97
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:31,028
This isn't about Gretchen.
It's not about any one person.

98
00:07:31,198 --> 00:07:33,223
And we have to finish it.

99
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:39,161
I need a minute.

100
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:43,000
Please.

101
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:24,844
I can't believe this.

102
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,384
What choice do we have?

103
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:29,847
Gretchen's on the team, like it or not.
We need those pages.

104
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:33,460
<i>Another perra we're jumping in bed with.
Not exactly new territory for us.</i>

105
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:35,151
I don't care who we partner with.

106
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:37,661
We get those papers, break in,
get this job done.

107
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:40,459
- She could still have ties to the Company.
- I don't know.

108
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:42,932
We'll worry about Gretchen
when the time is right.

109
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:45,901
For now, let's focus on the General.

110
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,109
This thing with Gretchen
doesn't change a thing.

111
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:54,072
We're... We're still close.

112
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:57,016
Closer to Scylla, farther from Wyatt.

113
00:08:58,619 --> 00:08:59,779
You don't know that.

114
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:02,820
- Just stay focused, all right?
- This is my focus, okay?

115
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:05,984
I'm doing the job, okay?
All right? All right?

116
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,926
Look, every day, the trail to my son's killer
gets a little bit colder.

117
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:13,894
That's all I do is focus.

118
00:09:27,114 --> 00:09:28,604
What are you doing?

119
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:33,520
- Was just...
- We're gonna need that downstairs.

120
00:09:34,054 --> 00:09:35,919
Yeah, I'll just be up here.

121
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:44,586
I see you two have come
to an agreement.

122
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:46,453
She's on work release.

123
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,723
Just like you.

124
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:50,056
What kind of work?

125
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,690
You and the secretary keep things quiet
in the office while Michael tunnels to Scylla.

126
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:58,967
You really think Scofield's gonna keep
his word, huh?

127
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:02,967
You horsewhipped the woman he loves.

128
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:05,008
Michael wants Scylla as badly as we do.

129
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,840
Yeah, he wanted out of prison too.

130
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:10,074
Our partnership lasted long enough
for that to happen...

131
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,083
...and then... we parted ways. Trust me.

132
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:15,278
Yeah, go in, sir.

133
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:19,590
Scofield will use you, and then
he's gonna bury the knife in your back...

134
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,729
...for what you did to his lady friend.
- Mr. Pfeiffer? Cole?

135
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,995
Where's Scylla?

136
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:30,662
Good morning to you, too, sir.

137
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:33,470
- Gentlemen.
- I gave you three days.

138
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,066
Where's Scylla?

139
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:44,548
Mr. Feng, let's not do anything rash.

140
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:47,510
So you're Feng.

141
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:52,119
We haven't met in person.
I was the liaison between the Company...

142
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:55,022
...and your Chinese employers
on Operation Copperhead.

143
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:58,661
- Susan?
- That's right.

144
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,664
You went from working
for the Company...

145
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,827
...to stealing the one thing that could
destroy them. Tight turn.

146
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:08,532
With the price Scylla commands
on the open market, anybody would turn.

147
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:10,574
Which is, by the way, 200.

148
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:20,019
Our paths never crossed on Copperhead,
but I did deal with one of your colleagues.

149
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:22,348
A less capable associate.

150
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,421
What ever happened to him?

151
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,557
He was skinned
and hung from an overpass.

152
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,291
Oh, yes. I recall.

153
00:12:30,464 --> 00:12:32,728
He couldn't deliver on promises made.

154
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:35,394
You may also recall
that he was my predecessor.

155
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:39,835
When I joined Copperhead, you got
what you wanted. You'll get Scylla too.

156
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,068
If I don't, I'll peel you
like a white grape.

157
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,478
And the price is 100.

158
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:48,874
One-fifty.

159
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,875
One-twenty-five.

160
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:54,119
Don't disappoint me.

161
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,757
Now...

162
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:05,456
...a hundred and twenty-five?
- Million.

163
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:10,231
Well, then, Susan, Gretchen,
whatever your name is...

164
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:15,137
...I suggest you find a way to bury
the hatchet with Michael Scofield's woman.

165
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:17,237
We got work to do.

166
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:31,756
Why do I get the feeling some bastard woke
up to an empty driveway this morning?

167
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:33,756
Relax. We got it from a scrap yard.

168
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:37,294
And you're pinning the hopes
of the entire mission on that relic?

169
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:39,022
If it was Card 1, I'd say no.

170
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,757
If this was Card 5, I'd say no.

171
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:42,367
But it's the last card.

172
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:46,438
I really think we can stage a hit-and-run
and get away with it.

173
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:48,607
All right.

174
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:50,933
We know where this guy works.

175
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:52,840
We know his route.

176
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:56,479
I'm gonna wait for him at this intersection.
He drives through...

177
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:59,047
...I smash him with my car
and get the card.

178
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:03,212
If by miracle you walk away from the crash,
the General will know you ripped him off.

179
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,290
Not if I pump him full of morphine first.

180
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,087
He'll wake up tomorrow in the hospital
happy as a clam...

181
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:09,819
...with no idea what happened.

182
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:13,865
While he's out cold, we download the card
onto the laptop, put the original back on.

183
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:17,162
Don't think this'll look suspicious
for the paramedics that show up?

184
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:19,100
That depends on
who the paramedics are.

185
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:21,035
At the federal impound lot downtown...

186
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:25,076
...there are currently four ambulances seized
from a drug smuggling ring.

187
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:26,473
All we need is one.

188
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,140
Go make yourself useful.

189
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:36,781
Time was, commanders would assemble
their troops before battle...

190
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:41,326
...and rehearse schemes of maneuver
on a square of dirt...

191
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:44,020
...using rocks
to depict enemy positions.

192
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:47,659
They called these rehearsals
"rock drills."

193
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:51,364
Laos was our rock drill.

194
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:56,737
Now it's time for the battle
to commence.

195
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:58,768
Griffin.

196
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,579
Flooding the Laotian market
with counterfeit kip was highly effective.

197
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:10,246
In phase two, the effect will take longer,
but the result will inevitably be the same.

198
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:16,522
I'm signing off on the order
to open up the next theater of operations.

199
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:22,735
Excuse me.

200
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:30,742
The message is untraceable.

201
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:33,880
Someone went to a lot of trouble
to cover their tracks.

202
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:38,115
How do we know this person
can deliver the brothers?

203
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:39,745
We don't.

204
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:44,485
Bait the hook. See if he bites.

205
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:56,936
Hey, my friend.

206
00:15:57,404 --> 00:15:59,269
- Who the hell are you?
- Don Self.

207
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,663
Homeland Security.

208
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:03,366
Phil Stroger.

209
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:04,567
- How's it going?
- Good.

210
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,144
<i>This is a grande.
This thing cost me 9 bucks.</i>

211
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:09,942
You California types
and your gourmet coffees.

212
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:11,607
Can I help you with something?

213
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:15,448
- This is a federal impound lot, correct?
- Yeah.

214
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:18,819
Okay, I think it's pretty obvious, Phil.
I need a car.

215
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:48,811
- You told Sara about the nosebleeds, huh?
- I'm worried about you.

216
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:51,219
Stop starting fires that I have to put out.

217
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:53,325
Mom couldn't outrun this.
You think you?

218
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:56,985
I'm not Mom, all right?
That was 20 years ago. This is different.

219
00:16:57,164 --> 00:16:59,325
It's totally different.

220
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:08,163
Get in.

221
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:12,504
My chief comes over
to the rookie's stretcher.

222
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,978
And he goes, "You got one hell of
a workmans' comp. Claim, kid."

223
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,416
Hey, now let's get that trip ticket
started.

224
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:24,216
Looks like I can hook you up
with a sedan for your stakeout.

225
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,518
You know what, Phil? I gotta go.

226
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,396
- What are you talking about?
- I gotta give a briefing to higher-ups.

227
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,260
Okay, can I come back for the sedan?

228
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,094
Suit yourself, Self.

229
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:39,436
I'll be back.

230
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:43,000
Don Self.

231
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:45,041
I need you to deliver a message.

232
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:46,903
Okay.

233
00:17:55,722 --> 00:18:00,955
I see your boyfriend's no longer supporting
the latest fashion in GPS technology.

234
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:05,253
If neither one of you are wearing monitors,
what are you still doing here?

235
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,195
Should be having hot fugitive sex...

236
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,028
...in every cash-only, no-tell motel
from here to Mexico.

237
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:13,366
Some things are more important
than what two people want.

238
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:16,602
I honestly hope that someday
that makes sense to you.

239
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:20,775
Look, Sara.

240
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,415
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:31,486
For Vegas.

242
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:36,121
I'm sorry for Vegas.

243
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:49,467
<i>- Hello?
- I have a message to you from Gretchen.</i>

244
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:54,577
She wants to meet with you tonight
at 7 p.m. At the Safari Motel on 109.

245
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:56,978
- Why?
- She said she wants to clear the air...

246
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,208
...whatever that means.

247
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:08,193
<i>Sara?</i>

248
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:11,153
I'm not interested.

249
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:14,424
Okay.

250
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:17,729
I got a bad feeling about this.

251
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:20,669
I'm the one on point.
You're on the ambulance.

252
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,398
Why are you so worried?

253
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,270
I just got a feeling.

254
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:27,379
If anything should happen,
call my mom in Chicago.

255
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:32,311
Tell her I didn't die like a damn convict,
locked up in some penitentiary.

256
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,180
Nothing's gonna happen.

257
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:49,969
- You ready for this?
- No.

258
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:51,467
Me and Sucre got this.

259
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:52,963
I know you do.

260
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,539
Good luck.

261
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:01,804
All right.

262
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:49,352
I'm in position.

263
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:54,090
Good. The rest of us are standing by
at the intersection.

264
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:05,066
No one's expecting you
to actually treat this bastard, right?

265
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:07,236
Yeah, I'm still a doctor.

266
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:11,714
Sucre, how you guys doing?

267
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:18,949
<i>Sucre?</i>

268
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:21,493
You gotta be kidding me.

269
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:23,595
<i>Sucre, are you there?</i>

270
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:25,822
We're good.

271
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:37,174
Being as I was the original recipient
of the late Mr. Whistler's artwork...

272
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:39,842
...what's my cut?

273
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,340
Twenty-five million.

274
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:48,453
Twenty-five million.
A hundred and twenty five, that's...

275
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:53,149
Just so you know,
I have a very keen sense of ownership.

276
00:21:53,593 --> 00:21:58,895
Six headstones in Coosa County Cemetery
can attest to that fact.

277
00:21:59,065 --> 00:22:03,593
The names on those grave markers
took a six-pack of Schlitz...

278
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,533
...I had cooling in the river.

279
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:08,265
That particular transgression
put me back 5 bucks.

280
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:10,932
Imagine what I'd do for 25 million.

281
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:14,203
You'll get your cut,
but you're gonna earn it.

282
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:19,307
And how much of that payday
is Scofield and his crew earning?

283
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:21,351
I doubt they'll be around to collect.

284
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:24,586
There's a lot of blood being spilled...

285
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:28,716
...and a lot of money being offered up
for just a little old black book.

286
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:31,320
What's so funny?

287
00:22:31,731 --> 00:22:36,100
That everyone thinks that Scylla's
just the Company's little black book.

288
00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:37,287
Hey, buddy.

289
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:45,064
I understand from Lincoln your mom
had a hamartoma in her right frontal lobe.

290
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:51,336
That's right.

291
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,375
When a tumor like that gets
to be problematic...

292
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:57,812
...it's gonna come with a lot of symptoms.
Loss of short-term memory...

293
00:23:57,984 --> 00:24:00,919
...problems with your depth perception,
with your motor skills.

294
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:04,352
- Lf you had that, you'd let me know?
- Yes, but I haven't.

295
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:05,957
And I won't.

296
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,752
And I'm fine.

297
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:19,396
"Two-l-B-A-3-3-3."

298
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:22,440
<i>Michael?</i>

299
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:26,376
<i>- Yeah?
- General is leaving.</i>

300
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:29,843
General is leaving.

301
00:24:30,016 --> 00:24:32,211
All right, everybody get ready.

302
00:24:42,462 --> 00:24:44,089
- You doing all right?
- I'm fine.

303
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:45,958
Not so good around blood, is all.

304
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:50,034
Well, I'll take care of the messy part.
Just help me get him on the gurney.

305
00:25:00,513 --> 00:25:02,777
Doesn't take two people
to crash a car, you know.

306
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:08,454
You're kidding, right?
After all I've been through with you...

307
00:25:08,621 --> 00:25:11,215
...now you're worried about my ass?

308
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:15,517
- Hey, shut up and drive, okay?
- Buckle up.

309
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:27,872
- What is it?
- Linc, we got him.

310
00:25:28,074 --> 00:25:30,167
<i>- He's two blocks away from you.
- We're on it.</i>

311
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,937
Here we go.

312
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:48,055
- What's he doing?
- Something's wrong.

313
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:49,592
He's turning around.

314
00:25:49,762 --> 00:25:52,731
- Linc, pull back. It's a trap.
- Let's get out of here.

315
00:25:59,772 --> 00:26:02,172
Sucre. Sucre, get down.

316
00:26:02,341 --> 00:26:04,036
- Get us out of here, man!
- Get down.

317
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:07,269
- Faster!
- Hang on. Hang on!

318
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:10,312
You all right?

319
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:11,507
Damn, you're hit.

320
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,843
Stay with us. You're gonna be all right.

321
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,910
- He came straight at us.
- We were set up.

322
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,310
They knew we were gonna be there?
Then they know about this place.

323
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:45,075
- Exactly.
- Brad, I'll need gauze.

324
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:47,048
Somebody could be coming here now.

325
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,383
- Lf they knew, we'd be dead.
- What if that Gretchen chick knows?

326
00:26:50,556 --> 00:26:54,287
She had a couple pages from Whistler's
Bird Book. It doesn't make her psychic.

327
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,428
Brad, I need some gauze.

328
00:27:26,392 --> 00:27:28,155
Well, it looks like someone set us up.

329
00:27:28,427 --> 00:27:29,689
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

330
00:27:30,596 --> 00:27:32,894
And I'm wondering if it was you.

331
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:38,066
First you give me the leper treatment,
now I'm a traitor.

332
00:27:38,237 --> 00:27:40,501
Who could have known
we'd be at that intersection?

333
00:27:40,673 --> 00:27:44,165
You know, just because I didn't do time
with you guys doesn't make me a rat.

334
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:46,675
I put just as much into this job
as anybody else.

335
00:27:46,846 --> 00:27:49,041
I make one mistake,
all of a sudden I'm Judas?

336
00:27:49,215 --> 00:27:50,614
No. You know what? No.

337
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:53,411
Call Self, okay,
because I'm going back to the can.

338
00:27:53,586 --> 00:27:56,054
- I'm done with this.
- All right, just calm down.

339
00:27:56,222 --> 00:27:57,780
Calm down.

340
00:27:57,957 --> 00:28:01,449
I want you to look up the local businesses
at the corner of King and Willow.

341
00:28:01,627 --> 00:28:03,822
I need the ones
with exterior security cameras.

342
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:07,397
Because I'm looking
for a license plate number, all right?

343
00:28:10,803 --> 00:28:12,168
How about an apology?

344
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:23,747
Where is Scofield? We've been waiting
for him to break ground all day.

345
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:26,214
He's taking care of one last thing.
He'll be here.

346
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:28,216
And what'd Sara say about our meeting?

347
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:30,082
She's not interested.

348
00:28:30,256 --> 00:28:32,588
Okay, well, if she changes her mind,
I'll be there.

349
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:36,057
Just so everyone knows,
this is Sara's last chance to settle up.

350
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:39,721
I want all the grievances out on the table,
so we can move forward.

351
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:42,599
Listen to me, skank.

352
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:45,965
You just got your stripes stripped off
your sleeve by your old boss.

353
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:48,663
So whatever clout
you had with the Company, it's gone.

354
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,372
You work for me now.

355
00:28:50,543 --> 00:28:53,307
So you could try to pull rank
on the hick here all you want.

356
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,674
But don't mistake my patience
for weakness.

357
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:59,850
You're alive right now for one reason:
Because I'm allowing you to be.

358
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:02,854
So when I get Scylla,
you'll get your traveling money.

359
00:29:03,022 --> 00:29:06,924
But when this is over,
if you step one foot on American soil...

360
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:09,459
...l'm gonna take this gun...

361
00:29:10,997 --> 00:29:14,091
...and I'm gonna put a bullet right there.

362
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,200
And that goes for you, too, Gummo.

363
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:21,431
Are we clear?

364
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:23,570
We're clear.

365
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,142
Here. I made this.

366
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:36,452
It's a chart of all the people
coming in and out...

367
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:41,753
...showing which times of the day are
the busiest and which are best for digging.

368
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:46,097
Just answer the phones.

369
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:51,461
I'll handle this.

370
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,538
- Did you get it?
- Hold on.

371
00:29:58,711 --> 00:30:00,406
Hurry up.

372
00:30:02,782 --> 00:30:04,181
Why are we doing this again?

373
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,545
It's an insurance policy.

374
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:09,916
If she tries to get out
of that big Scylla payday...

375
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:12,250
How big of a payday?

376
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:14,456
One million dollars.

377
00:30:18,998 --> 00:30:22,490
You put a gun on me again,
these aren't the only prints I'll be copying.

378
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:25,398
From this moment on, we are allies.

379
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:27,835
- Is she watching?
- Yes.

380
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:30,437
- Brace yourself.
- For what?

381
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:36,174
Don't you ever come in my office again
unless you're summoned.

382
00:30:43,022 --> 00:30:44,455
Burrows was in the car.

383
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:47,552
It appears our source is dependable.

384
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:50,525
When I said bait the hook,
I did not mean with me.

385
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:53,859
- They came that close to killing me.
- I wouldn't let that happen.

386
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:58,301
But if you're unhappy with my methods...

387
00:30:58,471 --> 00:31:00,996
...maybe you should parcel out the job
to someone else.

388
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:03,164
I don't accept resignations.

389
00:31:03,342 --> 00:31:06,743
Close the deal with the mystery man
and bring the brothers to me today...

390
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:08,971
...or your severance pay
will be a body bag.

391
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:10,240
Broad daylight.

392
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:12,475
City street and they knew your route.

393
00:31:13,052 --> 00:31:15,987
If Scofield's mission was to kill you...

394
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:18,550
...he'd have a better way to do it.

395
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:28,692
- You have everything you need?
- Yup, I'm good.

396
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:31,500
You're gonna be just fine.

397
00:31:32,104 --> 00:31:33,765
All right.

398
00:31:34,006 --> 00:31:35,667
Almost done. Breathe.

399
00:31:38,644 --> 00:31:39,668
There you go.

400
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:43,547
I would've died on this table
if it weren't for you.

401
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:45,343
Just wait until you get my bill.

402
00:31:45,518 --> 00:31:46,849
Hang in there, Sucre.

403
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:50,780
Even if the warehouse ain't
on the Company's radar, we sure as hell are.

404
00:31:50,956 --> 00:31:53,117
- This job's over.
- You don't know that.

405
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:55,192
I know I ain't going back to Fox River.

406
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:59,127
What do you think Self's gonna do
when he finds out the Company's made us?

407
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:02,598
We're about to find out. Yeah.

408
00:32:03,202 --> 00:32:06,228
Hey, where the hell is Roland?
His just GPS went offline.

409
00:32:45,811 --> 00:32:48,245
- Well?
- He took the Corolla.

410
00:32:50,816 --> 00:32:52,750
- He take his laptop too?
- Yeah.

411
00:32:53,552 --> 00:32:54,917
Alex.

412
00:33:03,863 --> 00:33:05,091
You doing okay?

413
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:07,094
- How much longer, doc?
- Almost.

414
00:33:08,501 --> 00:33:11,470
Hey, you got this covered?

415
00:33:11,637 --> 00:33:14,504
What are you still doing here?
Go get the son of a bitch.

416
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:20,036
All done.

417
00:34:21,674 --> 00:34:22,698
You got my money?

418
00:34:27,046 --> 00:34:29,446
I thought this was gonna be
a legit transaction.

419
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:32,413
Don't got my money,
I don't got the location of the brothers.

420
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:34,280
Where are they?

421
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:38,889
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

422
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:23,859
Sara.

423
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:33,472
Hello, Sara.

424
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:43,185
A former mentor of mine...

425
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:46,483
...once told me a story
that I think applies to this situation.

426
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:48,058
At the end of the Civil War...

427
00:35:48,227 --> 00:35:52,459
...Grant's Union Army had Lee's Confederate
soldiers outflanked at Appomattox.

428
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:54,826
Lee understood the futility
of more bloodshed...

429
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,027
...so he requested a cease-fire.
He wanted to bring an end to the fighting.

430
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:01,832
Soldiers that had been killing
each other that morning...

431
00:36:02,007 --> 00:36:04,669
...walked across the lines
for the first time as allies...

432
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:07,334
...to trade Northern coffee
for Southern tobacco.

433
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:13,013
Now, I don't expect us to exchange gifts,
but that doesn't mean we can't be allies.

434
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,860
Of course, you can't have a cease-fire...

435
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:26,395
...without both parties getting
what they want.

436
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:41,639
You have five minutes.

437
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:44,708
Put as many scars on my back
as possible.

438
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:12,609
I don't wanna rush you,
but you have four minutes left.

439
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:14,071
What was her name?

440
00:37:14,246 --> 00:37:17,875
This is a one-time deal, Sara.
You want your pound of flesh, take it now.

441
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,950
- What was her name?
- Who?

442
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,553
The guard you shot
and left to die in my arms.

443
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:24,279
That's what this is about?

444
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:26,117
A guard that couldn't do her job?

445
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:31,620
What was her name?

446
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:40,202
What was her name?

447
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,372
- Taylor.
- Her first name.

448
00:37:45,277 --> 00:37:46,801
Michelle, I think.

449
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:50,147
You should know
that this isn't about me.

450
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,215
I can handle the scars you put
on my back.

451
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:54,215
- But what you did to Mi...
- I had orders.

452
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,186
- She tried to help you escape.
- She did help me escape. She didn't try.

453
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:05,654
Sara.

454
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:17,004
You were too busy making an example
of her to find the key she left me.

455
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:19,644
Then she got what she deserved.

456
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,775
She saved my life.

457
00:38:29,388 --> 00:38:31,083
And you took hers.

458
00:38:32,124 --> 00:38:34,149
You proved your point.

459
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:36,622
We're even.

460
00:38:38,263 --> 00:38:40,231
We're a long way from even.

461
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:43,662
And when this is over,
you'll pay for Michelle.

462
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:50,467
Where are they?

463
00:38:55,414 --> 00:38:58,577
The thing about a gunshot
to the kneecap...

464
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:01,216
...it takes days to die from it.

465
00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:05,717
Now, if I were to shoot you,
let's say here...

466
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:08,155
...the hollow point
would tumble through you...

467
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:10,852
...leaving white-hot slivers
in your insides...

468
00:39:11,029 --> 00:39:13,725
...causing unimaginable pain...

469
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:17,198
...only ending when you bled out
on this pavement.

470
00:39:17,936 --> 00:39:20,234
You don't want that, do you?

471
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:26,576
Then tell me where the brothers are.

472
00:39:27,513 --> 00:39:29,174
In a warehouse.

473
00:39:29,348 --> 00:39:32,317
Pier 31 in San Pedro. They're all there.

474
00:39:32,484 --> 00:39:33,951
Please.

475
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:36,378
Thank you.

476
00:39:37,523 --> 00:39:39,252
No! What are you doing?!

477
00:39:39,424 --> 00:39:41,858
I told you where they were!
What are you?!

478
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,034
No, no. No.

479
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:07,314
All right, all right.

480
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:12,954
No.

481
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,683
You'll get your shot. Back off.

482
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,328
- Alex, listen to him.
- Hey, hey, hey.

483
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:18,758
You'll get your shot, man.

484
00:40:18,931 --> 00:40:20,125
You'll get your shot.

485
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:24,095
Michael, come on. He sold us out.
What are you doing?

486
00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:25,896
We gotta go.

487
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:53,731
Michael.

488
00:40:56,368 --> 00:40:58,336
Michael, let's go.

489
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:14,351
Don't hand me any more updates.

490
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:18,483
They're surveilling me.

491
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:21,358
They're coming after me.

492
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:23,555
General, we'll get them.

493
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:27,027
This isn't the first time
someone's made an attempt on your life.

494
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,996
This is not an attempt on my life.

495
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,761
This is an attempt on my card.

496
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:38,169
- Get Wyatt.
- We're trying to contact him.

497
00:41:38,343 --> 00:41:40,140
Don't try anything. Just get Wyatt.

498
00:41:40,746 --> 00:41:43,306
- How do you wanna proceed?
- I want it moved.

499
00:41:43,482 --> 00:41:46,474
To make the necessary arrangements
for security would take days...

500
00:41:46,652 --> 00:41:48,677
I don't care about logistics.

501
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:50,617
I want it moved.

502
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:52,552
Move Scylla.

503
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:54,950
Now!

504
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,930
As soon as we possibly can.

505
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:16,370
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

506
00:42:16,548 --> 00:42:18,209
I know.

507
00:42:20,352 --> 00:42:21,944
I know.

508
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:25,354
I'm not ready to go, man.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
