1
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:21,307
<i>You ready?</i>

2
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:25,962
Didn't think I'd be
this nervous.

3
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:32,878
Now or never.

4
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:40,794
Alright, papi,
let's do this.

5
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:43,487
He's over there.

6
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,612
You must be
Michael.

7
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:56,876
Your friend,
Fernando,

8
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,564
tells me you could
use my services today.

9
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,347
Very much so.

10
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:03,106
And I assume that's
the other half of your team?

11
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:13,902
You look beautiful.

12
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:16,674
Thank you.

13
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:24,426
And it's my understanding
you'd like to keep this simple?

14
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:28,447
We've never actually managed
to keep anything simple...

15
00:01:28,944 --> 00:01:30,086
You could try.

16
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,566
Well.
Let's begin then, shall we?

17
00:01:33,903 --> 00:01:36,412
Family and friends,
we gather here...

18
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:41,334
to celebrate the union between
Michael Scofield and Sara Tancredi.

19
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,701
- Sorry to break up the party.
- What the hell's going on?

20
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:28,905
We have
an arrest warrant.

21
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:30,100
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

22
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:32,869
We talked to
Agent Paul Kellerman in D.C.

23
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:33,922
<i>We've settled this
with the feds.</i>

24
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:35,673
We settled this with
the feds weeks ago!

25
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:36,890
Sir, back up!

26
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:38,445
- We were exonerated.
- Sir...

27
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,010
- We were exonerated!
- <i>Back up!</i>

28
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:42,939
<i>We're not here for you.
We're here for her.</i>

29
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:46,545
She didn't do anything.
She wasn't involved.

30
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,066
<i>Don't make this
escalate!</i>

31
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:49,385
Sara Tancredi,

32
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,006
you're under arrest for
the murder of Christina Hampton.

33
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:52,739
<i>What?!</i>

34
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:54,048
<i>She didn't kill
anyone!</i>

35
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,218
Funny. Surveillance camera
footage says different.

36
00:02:59,046 --> 00:02:59,851
Michael.

37
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,649
- <i>Please, right this way.</i>
- Michael.

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,963
- <i>Second car, please.</i>
- <i>Michael!</i>

39
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:04,906
- <i>Second car.</i>
- <i>What's going on?</i>

40
00:03:05,064 --> 00:03:05,804
<i>Back up, please.</i>

41
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,603
S04E23:
The Old Ball And Chain

42
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:19,543
They're not gonna
let me see her.

43
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,186
Why did Kellerman send you
if you can't do anything?

44
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:25,365
They're trying
to break both of you.

45
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:28,662
Look, she has a constitutional right
to reasonable visitation.

46
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:31,267
I'll draw up an order to show cause
and get it before the judge immediately.

47
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:31,979
<i>While you're at it,</i>

48
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:33,772
- can you argue in self defence?
- How?

49
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:37,409
Anything that might help her
is out of frame.

50
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,904
Security camera only shows Sara
stepping up and firing at the victim.

51
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:44,979
- Pull the trigger, Michael.
- Drop... the gun!

52
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:46,729
<i>Misfire.</i>

53
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,057
- She worked for the Company.
- To you.

54
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:55,060
To a jury, she's Christina Hampton,
Technology Consultant.

55
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:56,972
And because she was so good
at hiding her true identity,

56
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:58,177
we can't
prove otherwise.

57
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,922
<i>Look,
you were all exonerated.</i>

58
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:02,991
It did not sit well
with law enforcement.

59
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,365
If they can make Sara
pay for it, they will.

60
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:07,224
How much time
is she looking at?

61
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:10,664
25 to life.

62
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,804
You.
Over here.

63
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,974
You.
Here.

64
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:37,574
<i>You.</i>

65
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:38,557
Here.

66
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,192
This one's yours.

67
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,277
Am I supposed to be
in a different facility?

68
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,624
<i>I don't think so.</i>

69
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,292
I haven't been convicted
of anything yet.

70
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:52,358
I'm supposed to be in a jail.
This is prison.

71
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,085
Overcrowding
and budget cuts, fish.

72
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,558
This is the jail.
That's the prison.

73
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:09,649
<i>'Sup, homie?
You need some help?</i>

74
00:05:13,718 --> 00:05:15,215
<i>You got everything
you need over there?</i>

75
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,642
<i>Why don't you go help
and make her bed?</i>

76
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:28,220
Don't let them spook you.
They just like to intimidate.

77
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,378
They are good at it.

78
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:30,909
Look.

79
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:34,540
This jail-prison
hybrid thing's B.S.

80
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:36,604
Come on.

81
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:38,450
The other one's
practically empty.

82
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:40,364
You can ride it out
to your court date there.

83
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,516
Thank you.

84
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,563
Here. This should be a little bit
more comfortable for you.

85
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,257
Okay.

86
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:13,281
What's going on?

87
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,701
<i>You know...</i>

88
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:19,336
At first,
I couldn't place your name.

89
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:22,904
Tancredi.
It sounded so familiar.

90
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:25,399
But then, Haggs here,
figured it out.

91
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:28,060
I remembered your pretty face
from the papers.

92
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,777
You're not
going anywhere, fish.

93
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:34,594
This is going
to happen.

94
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:35,820
Half a dozen guards

95
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:38,153
lost their jobs and pensions
at Fox River.

96
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:39,451
Another dozen
were put on probation,

97
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:40,643
after you decided

98
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,134
to leave
the door open

99
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,334
for your boyfriend
and his seven convict pals.

100
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:45,377
<i>And we...</i>

101
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,791
ain't gonna let anything
like that happen again.

102
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:53,311
Don't worry,

103
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:54,965
we won't hit
the baby basket.

104
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,020
<i>That's right.</i>

105
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:16,500
Looked like that welcome wagon
ran over your face.

106
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,530
It looks
that way, huh?

107
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:25,353
<i>Alright, well...</i>

108
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:26,956
<i>You need something,
you just ask for me.</i>

109
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:29,460
Everybody calls me
"Daddy".

110
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:00,205
Special delivery.

111
00:08:03,444 --> 00:08:05,021
You know,
all we need is a little cash,

112
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:06,782
spread around
in places.

113
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:08,136
I told you.

114
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,909
The government's
exposing my assets.

115
00:08:11,494 --> 00:08:13,537
You tellin' me you can't get
your hands on the cash?

116
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:16,415
Unless, that's the least
you could do.

117
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:18,584
Considering you was gonna kill me
not too long ago.

118
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:20,834
Goodbye, Theodore.

119
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,384
You ain't never been
incarcerated before,

120
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:28,511
and I never been
incarcerated here.

121
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:28,928
Therefore,

122
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:31,252
now let's just say
this handicapped connie

123
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,381
got the juicy hand back
in Fox River.

124
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:39,242
<i>Your pathetic existence here
could be ameliorated.</i>

125
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:40,818
<i>As can my life,</i>

126
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:43,822
all with a little
"Roberto de Niro".

127
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:47,050
One of our friends has been
apprehended by the authorities.

128
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:51,617
<i>Looks like we've got
a new neighbour.</i>

129
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:55,303
I'm never gonna get out
of this prison alive.

130
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:56,268
I know that.

131
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,555
I wanna bring my enemy
down with me.

132
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,335
I want her dead.

133
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:11,722
Either way, it's going
to require a capital.

134
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:13,568
A capital
you no longer have.

135
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:16,320
My rainy day plan.
Do you know where it is?

136
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:17,481
<i>Jonathan.</i>

137
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,894
I'd assume that that would be
used for your defense.

138
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:21,692
It's good money
after bad, Joe.

139
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:23,575
They're not gonna
let me out of here.

140
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:26,235
No matter how many shots,
it's that hard.

141
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:28,842
Get that.

142
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:32,932
To our friend, in the sister cells,
across the compound.

143
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:56,274
<i>Officer Johnson...</i>

144
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,933
<i>Officer Riley, could you come
to your extension</i>

145
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:11,964
<i>in 30 seconds...</i>

146
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:13,386
Excuse me.

147
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:17,249
<i>Bad move.</i>

148
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:22,948
Last time someone touched her,
they got a crack kneecap.

149
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,285
You're much braver
than I gave you credit for.

150
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,613
Either that,
or you're amazingly nice.

151
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,995
Do I look like
I wanna talk to you?

152
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,598
I just say,
a woman in your position

153
00:10:51,598 --> 00:10:53,142
laid up
for some protection.

154
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:55,679
Join the prison gang?
I don't think so.

155
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:57,236
Not a gang.
No.

156
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,305
A family.

157
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:02,474
They don't call her "Daddy"
for nothin'.

158
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,465
That's her wife.

159
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:08,993
And those are
her kids.

160
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,559
- Are you okay?
- Stay the hell away from me.

161
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:20,938
I need
to go down the infirmary.

162
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:22,765
<i>Can't go down the infirmiary
without a release form.</i>

163
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,709
I'm having muscle contractions
on my throat.

164
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:25,846
And my jaws'
tightening up.

165
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:28,031
It's--It's just
could be indigestions,

166
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:28,949
I'm not poisoned.

167
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:30,989
No. That's the government cheese.
You'll get used to it.

168
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:33,075
If I don't get to the hospital
in the next 15 minutes,

169
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:35,500
I will die
and my baby will die.

170
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:36,295
Please.

171
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:38,301
<i>Boss.</i>

172
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:40,585
Why don't you let her
go see the doc?

173
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:46,665
Please.

174
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:49,827
This is Kaorla.

175
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:51,404
Inmate going
to the infirmary.

176
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:02,013
We were able to administer
the charcoal labrigintein.

177
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:03,772
You and your baby
are gonna be okay.

178
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,516
You know the strignein didn't get into
my meatloaf all by itself, right?

179
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,769
Well then, you need to talk
to the warden about it.

180
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,222
Then how about talking to me
about your face?

181
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,620
<i>You want to tell me
how that happened?</i>

182
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:22,791
I caught an elbow
playing basketball.

183
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,099
We should discuss your...
situation.

184
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,932
As I'm sure
you've ascertained

185
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:31,633
this isn't going to be
a run-of-the-mill pregnancy.

186
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:33,502
Do I deliver in here?

187
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:34,088
No.

188
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,443
The day we induce,
we'll secure you in an ambulance.

189
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,016
We'll take you to St. Lucia
down the road.

190
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:40,469
We'll cordone off a room.

191
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:42,061
There'll be three armed guards
in there with me,

192
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:42,915
when you give birth.

193
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:44,783
Do I get
to see my baby?

194
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:47,458
You'll have 30 minutes
before we take it away.

195
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:53,475
I've seen this process
a dozen times.

196
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:56,784
<i>After the mothers come back here,
the depression's almost unbearable.</i>

197
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:57,868
<i>My advice,</i>

198
00:12:58,786 --> 00:12:59,971
it's a lot
less messy,

199
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:01,955
if you'd just think of yourself
as a surrogate.

200
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:14,422
Yeah?

201
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:16,728
Michael,
it's Lou Phillips.

202
00:13:17,026 --> 00:13:17,799
Listen, um...

203
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:19,590
Your wife had
an incident earlier today.

204
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:21,642
Someone tried
to poison her.

205
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:23,644
What are you
talking about?

206
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,145
Michael,
I need you to focus.

207
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,858
<i>Do you have any idea
who might have done this?</i>

208
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:28,349
Michael?

209
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:30,219
Michael?!

210
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,004
<i>Go ahead,
let him in.</i>

211
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:47,760
If I had a list of all the people
who might come to visit me...

212
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,056
your name would be at the bottom,
somewhere below

213
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:52,635
Jesus Christ
and Scooby Doo.

214
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:56,348
- Someone tried to poison Sara today.
- Mercy--

215
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,887
Only you
would be depraved enough,

216
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:02,148
to think that killing an innocent woman
and her unborn child

217
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:05,019
would bring you some kind of peace
before your execution.

218
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,438
Sara is with child?

219
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,886
Congratulations!

220
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:13,385
This is like the 4th of July
and Christmas Day rolled into one.

221
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,486
I am asking you,

222
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:17,698
father to father,
to leave her alone.

223
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,659
You can kill me
if you want to kill me,

224
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:22,119
I'll trade my life
for hers.

225
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,502
But leave Sara alone.

226
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:25,789
Michael...

227
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,607
If you were killed,

228
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:30,878
your pain would last
a moment.

229
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:32,768
If Sara were killed,

230
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:35,889
your pain would last
the rest of your life.

231
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,723
Now that's got to be appealing
to whoever put out this hit.

232
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:41,970
But don't worry,
Michael.

233
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:44,950
If I find out anything,
I'll be sure to let you know.

234
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,521
<i>Prison life
can be tough.</i>

235
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,807
If I remember correctly,

236
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,033
you have two missing toes
that can attest to that bag.

237
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:55,986
I don't think you understand.
She's not safe here!

238
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:57,977
Please.

239
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,652
Please just approve the transfer
to another facility.

240
00:15:01,658 --> 00:15:03,786
If I grant her a transfer,
everybody's gonna want one.

241
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:05,245
What about
segregrated housing?

242
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,232
Is there something
that I should know about

243
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:09,083
the structural integrity
of shoe?

244
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,427
I can see
where this is going.

245
00:15:11,462 --> 00:15:12,711
I know who you are.

246
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,440
And I'm not going
to let you turn my prison

247
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:15,547
into the next
Fox River.

248
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:18,717
All I'm trying to do,
is keep my wife alive.

249
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,594
You do know
she's pregnant.

250
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:22,514
I don't care.

251
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:38,235
Here.

252
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:39,997
Thanks.

253
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:41,407
In case I haven't
made myself clear--

254
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:44,368
Sara Tancredi is not getting
any preferential treatment.

255
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:47,781
And you've made
yourself perfectly clear.

256
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:49,081
Thank you
for your time.

257
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:56,588
- What happened?
- The General wants Sara dead

258
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,340
and the warden's just
gonna let that happen.

259
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:00,775
We gotta lure in the case
if he's gonna get her out, right?

260
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:01,593
Which is
not enough time.

261
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:03,804
She stays in that prison,
someone's going to kill her.

262
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:06,411
I guess we don't have
a choice.

263
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,687
We're breaking her out.

264
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:19,271
<i>In my 16 years
in the Bureau,</i>

265
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:21,894
I've worked cases under
43 different agents.

266
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:24,643
<i>Alexander Mahone,</i>

267
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,979
<i>is the smartest,</i>

268
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:28,355
bravest,

269
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:30,629
most honorable man,

270
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:32,276
I've ever had the pleasure
of serving with.

271
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:37,948
As one of those 43 agents,
I can't help but feel a bit offended.

272
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,952
Because obviously, I am not as honoured
as this drive-addicted murderer.

273
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:45,664
Alex has been clean and sober
for four months.

274
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:48,417
And he's been completely
exonerated of all crimes

275
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:50,419
<i>associated with his involvement
with the Company.</i>

276
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:53,714
That doesn't include the shooting
and murder of one Oscar Shales

277
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:56,161
and burying his body
under his bird bath--

278
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:57,423
That is just an allegation.

279
00:16:58,302 --> 00:16:59,136
Let's move on,
shall we?

280
00:16:59,136 --> 00:17:01,931
All those in favor of
reinstating Alexander Mahone,

281
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:05,017
a Special Agent in the Federal
Bureau of Investigation--

282
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:06,810
Aye.

283
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:12,066
- All those oppose?
- Alright, alright, I've--

284
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:19,406
Thank you
for the invite, Richard.

285
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:23,744
It's always a pleasure.

286
00:17:26,372 --> 00:17:28,749
You know, Alex.
This ruling can't be revisited.

287
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,620
If you're able to
sufficiently demonstrate,

288
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:34,286
just how committed you are
to a life of service.

289
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:38,467
Now, as you may know,
Sara Tancredi was arrested recently,

290
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,929
and is currently being housed
at the Miami Dade State Penitentiary.

291
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:45,516
We have concerns that Michael Scofield
may have other plans for her.

292
00:17:47,017 --> 00:17:50,452
So this...
This is why you invite me in here.

293
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,943
<i>Well obviously, if Scofield were,
to be able to</i>

294
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:56,277
pull off this plot
of another breakout,

295
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,405
the public embarassment will be
immensed to the Bureau.

296
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:02,591
So... having someone to get us
credible information,

297
00:18:02,992 --> 00:18:04,868
that would be worth
something to us.

298
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:07,705
Agent Wheatley is set up in Miami.
He would be your contact.

299
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:09,206
You're something else.

300
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:19,425
Now...

301
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:20,764
We both know...

302
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,304
how badly you want
that badge back.

303
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,348
<i>Give me a reason
to give it to you.</i>

304
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:30,109
What's your plan
after we break her out?

305
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:30,936
We're on the run
again?

306
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:33,022
First things first.
Let's get her out of there.

307
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:33,703
<i>Hey, papi.</i>

308
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:36,984
The fed that arrested Sara,
is outside, staking us out.

309
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:41,764
Look, if you're worried about
getting into trouble again,

310
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,449
go back to Chicago,
go back to your family.

311
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:45,067
I'll understand.

312
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:46,410
Are you kidding me?

313
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:48,346
After all the crap we've been through,
I'm just going to leave you here

314
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:49,121
and Sara in there?

315
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:51,373
You shut up
and don't bring it up again.

316
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,384
- What's all that?
- Newspaper clippings--

317
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:57,137
Covering seven
different escape attempts,

318
00:18:57,172 --> 00:18:58,725
from Miami Dade's
State Pen,

319
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,454
over the last 60 years.
None of them--

320
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:02,301
None of them
successful.

321
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,429
So we weigh them all,
and we learn what not to do.

322
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:06,889
Well, the prison officials
learned a lot.

323
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:08,599
They re-evaluated,
they retrofitted...

324
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:10,893
The prison's pratically
escape-proof.

325
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,228
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine--

326
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:17,316
I guess so if we can't go through,
what if we go down?

327
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:20,027
Like down into the prison?
Like we parachute in.

328
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:21,273
Yeah.

329
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:22,667
Yeah.
You parachute in,

330
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:23,864
- you find her, and we get he rout.
- Are you kidding?

331
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:25,444
- I'm serious.
- That's suicide!

332
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:26,538
Hey, hey...

333
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,827
Newspapers clippings only
going to get us so far.

334
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:30,788
We need some more information
about the prison.

335
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:32,414
So let's do
some recon work.

336
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,039
Camera, electronic
tape measure, dry ice.

337
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:36,628
What's this?

338
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:38,003
It's a shopping list.

339
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:44,768
You need
to come with me, doc.

340
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:47,288
I have a doctor's appointment
for my pregnancy in a few minutes.

341
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:48,124
It'll wait.

342
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:50,709
In here.

343
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:53,936
Hold it.

344
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:04,947
I don't know
what you want,

345
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:06,657
but I promise you,
I will go down and fight it.

346
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:09,197
Damn baby,
I ain't gonna hurt you.

347
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:12,454
Hell, I ain't even gonna
touch you.

348
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:20,068
See, I run the motor pool
detail in here.

349
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:23,048
And I was thinkin' if you want
to get yourself a little fresh air,

350
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:25,791
and not have to worry about
getting stuck in the back,

351
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:28,470
then you could come in,
work with me...

352
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:23,943
You're the fed
from my wedding.

353
00:21:24,193 --> 00:21:25,653
Yeah, you can call me
Agent Wheatley.

354
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,118
I could call you
a lot of things.

355
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,280
- Where you headed?
- Sea World.

356
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:29,160
<i>Sea World?</i>

357
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:30,309
There isn't one
in Miami.

358
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:31,016
My loss.

359
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:32,823
<i>No. What really be
your loss,</i>

360
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,921
<i>is getting
your wife killed,</i>

361
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,119
by doing something stupid.

362
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:37,706
- Are you threatening Sara?
- No, no. Not at all--

363
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,662
I'm just saying that if you were gonna
try and revoke her sentence.

364
00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:42,110
Bullets fly, Michael.

365
00:21:42,145 --> 00:21:44,208
And if she'd get hurt,
that'd be on you.

366
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:45,555
Funny hearing that
from the guy

367
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:47,128
who put her in prison
in the first place.

368
00:21:47,163 --> 00:21:49,660
No, I didn't put her in prison.
State of Florida did.

369
00:21:49,927 --> 00:21:52,361
It's just my job to make sure
that she stays there.

370
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:53,952
So, uh...

371
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:56,008
Where's all
your little buddies?

372
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:06,612
Alright.
Drop in some more dry ice.

373
00:22:22,553 --> 00:22:25,710
Fence line is four feet...
from the road.

374
00:22:32,138 --> 00:22:35,892
And 32 feet...
from the east camera.

375
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,739
Hurry up.
They're gonna see the laser.

376
00:22:38,214 --> 00:22:39,658
I'm going as fast
as I can, papi.

377
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:46,333
- He followed you?
- Yeah, but he's gone now.

378
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:48,054
You guys almost done?

379
00:22:49,655 --> 00:22:50,265
Almost.

380
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:51,172
<i>Great.</i>

381
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:53,105
I'll meet you back
at the loft.

382
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:14,347
Well, you just
a natural.

383
00:23:16,557 --> 00:23:18,256
I bet you was
a hell of a surgeon.

384
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:22,083
<i>Handing out
condoms to cons</i>

385
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:23,484
were makin'
no damn surgeon!

386
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:24,649
What in the hell
is the matter with you?

387
00:23:24,732 --> 00:23:26,218
You ain't even ask me
if she can come...

388
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:27,688
One day, for real!

389
00:23:27,944 --> 00:23:30,171
Can we go one day
without your mouth? One!

390
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:35,476
Let it be today.

391
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:42,956
I'm sorry.

392
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,935
You got to forgive
my old lady, she's...

393
00:23:46,295 --> 00:23:48,763
You just a little bit
easy on eyes, you know?

394
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:50,683
She's just
the jealous type.

395
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:53,487
Crazy type
is more like it.

396
00:23:54,762 --> 00:23:56,889
What? You wanna
watch your tone, Agatha.

397
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,789
Sorry.

398
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,372
Or you want me
take off my belt?

399
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:01,143
<i>Sorry.</i>

400
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:05,980
Kid.

401
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:10,945
It's rough.
It's hard running a family.

402
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:16,867
It's important though that, uh--
That you have one--

403
00:24:18,244 --> 00:24:19,808
I have a family.
I have a husband.

404
00:24:20,037 --> 00:24:22,373
Oh, you've got a husband?
Is he here?

405
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:25,710
They let him bring you in here,
with you, when you came?

406
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:27,578
No.

407
00:24:28,963 --> 00:24:30,306
Yeah,
I had a husband too.

408
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:35,305
18 years
is a long time to wait.

409
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:41,225
So, you know.
If this ain't for you,

410
00:24:42,476 --> 00:24:43,126
that's cool.

411
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:49,725
Then you pick up
that nasty oil,

412
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,909
take it out and put it
in the repository.

413
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:53,228
Okay.

414
00:25:16,452 --> 00:25:17,473
We gotta go, bro.

415
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:26,652
- Get your hands off me.
- When I'm good and ready.

416
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:29,497
What's Burrows doing
by the fence?

417
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:40,826
Please don't make me
ask you again, Sara.

418
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:54,960
Nobody here to help you,
but yourself.

419
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:56,737
Are you going
to answer me?

420
00:25:57,593 --> 00:25:58,594
You tried to kill me.

421
00:25:59,428 --> 00:26:00,609
Line it up, cons.

422
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,934
<i>Go back inside.</i>

423
00:26:02,014 --> 00:26:04,934
You, get back to your detail.
Now!

424
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:26,941
I want you to pass along
an offer to your boy.

425
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:28,386
What he's paying
his people

426
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:30,685
to dust that Tancredi
chicken bitch pop...

427
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:33,316
My woman are good
for a cut rate.

428
00:26:35,281 --> 00:26:37,652
Just what kind of discount
are you proposing here?

429
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:39,218
Tell him, uh...

430
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:43,061
He's offering a 100 grand,
my girl will take 30.

431
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:45,004
<i>No, 40.</i>

432
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:46,229
40.

433
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:48,477
Perfect.

434
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:50,380
I'll tell him.

435
00:26:56,777 --> 00:26:58,172
Hey, five star.

436
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:05,243
So you have no cash,
whatsoever...

437
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:07,443
I'm sorry.

438
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:10,980
I couldn't hear you over
the sound of that broken record.

439
00:27:16,297 --> 00:27:16,903
Got it.

440
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:20,874
I won't ask again.

441
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:29,232
<i>Whose act is stupid
as you look, huh?</i>

442
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,113
Oh, to what do
we owe the honor?

443
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,196
I've been thinking...

444
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:38,952
<i>Well, no need
to be uh, shy.</i>

445
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:40,286
Just spit it out.

446
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:42,990
I've changed my mind.

447
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:45,362
No, well maybe,
Daddy changed her mind.

448
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:48,554
Maybe she don't
want you here anymore.

449
00:27:48,955 --> 00:27:49,904
<i>Sport's right.</i>

450
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,267
I recently have rolled up
my welcome mat.

451
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,891
Peace.

452
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,094
- Please.
- Please, what?

453
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:07,640
Please, may I be
a part of your family?

454
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,190
Take a walk.

455
00:28:14,021 --> 00:28:15,022
Take a walk!

456
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,487
I would love that. I would--
Sit down. I really would.

457
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:29,346
You see, its not that easy.
It's just saying "I do".

458
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:34,754
See, in order
to making a commitment...

459
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:36,357
to a family...

460
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:46,780
It's something
you gotta prove.

461
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:48,946
That's right,
we all did it.

462
00:28:58,024 --> 00:29:00,768
It's a commitment...
to the family code.

463
00:29:03,946 --> 00:29:05,183
It's a code
you gotta wear.

464
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:22,388
Alex!

465
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,699
- What's up?
- What--

466
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:26,691
How you doing,
man?

467
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:27,698
What's going on?

468
00:29:29,176 --> 00:29:29,964
We gotta talk.

469
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,260
Alright.

470
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:34,033
They're watching you.

471
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,285
- We know. We gotta a fed on us.
- No. Not just one.

472
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:38,909
The whole department.

473
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:41,587
Sounds a lot like
inside information, Alex.

474
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,916
What you do?
Make a deal with the feds?

475
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:47,340
They offered me
my old job back,

476
00:29:47,404 --> 00:29:48,764
if I came down here
to spy on you.

477
00:29:49,764 --> 00:29:52,121
Now the fed you're talking about,
his name is Wheatley.

478
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:53,151
He's running point.

479
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:54,287
So now we know.

480
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:55,947
So if you really
gonna do this,

481
00:29:57,355 --> 00:29:58,389
you gotta
do it right.

482
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,715
And I'll help you
if you need me.

483
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:05,142
What else do you get?

484
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,226
Sara was working the motor pool
today at 4 o'clock.

485
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,945
Motor pool is here.

486
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:13,314
This hold by two security cameras,
along the perimeter of the prison.

487
00:30:13,404 --> 00:30:14,713
What about
secondary entrances?

488
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:17,500
No loading dock,
no personnel entrance--

489
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:18,326
Fences?

490
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:21,162
15 feet high,
covered in rave wires.

491
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:22,997
- <i>Electrified?</i>
- <i>No. Why?</i>

492
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:25,100
If Sara can get herself back
to motor pool,

493
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:27,636
I think we can find
a way inside.

494
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:30,123
With all the different retrofits
over the years,

495
00:30:30,158 --> 00:30:31,426
the fence line
is widened.

496
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:34,069
But security cameras remain exactly
where they've always been.

497
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:36,059
They've never accounted
for the difference.

498
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:39,217
- There's a blindspot.
- Yeah. Right here.

499
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,766
If Sara can get back to that spot,
we can breach the fence.

500
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:42,762
<i>It's risky, Michael.</i>

501
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:44,701
That's all we've got.

502
00:30:45,353 --> 00:30:47,146
How much time to tell Sara
where we going to meet her?

503
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:47,741
How?

504
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,783
We get no visitations,
no phone calls.

505
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,895
It's clean.
Take it to Tancredi.

506
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,725
<i>Remember when I taught you
about flowers?</i>

507
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,538
<i>I wish I was
with you now.</i>

508
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:26,924
<i>To see you holding one
in your hand.</i>

509
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:34,522
<i>To see you holding one
in your hand.</i>

510
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:53,867
<i>Tomorrow. PM.
Seven. Oil dump.</i>

511
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:14,307
Sure looks like
you've been busy.

512
00:32:14,426 --> 00:32:15,958
Do you have a warrant,
Agent Wheatley?

513
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:18,019
A warrant?
No, I don't need one.

514
00:32:18,195 --> 00:32:20,167
My testimony would be
that your brother let me in.

515
00:32:20,323 --> 00:32:23,159
Once inside,
saw all this evidence,

516
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:24,631
<i>right in plain sight.</i>

517
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:26,993
<i>What judge is gonna take
your word over mine?</i>

518
00:32:26,996 --> 00:32:27,805
What evidence?

519
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,124
Those pictures were taken
from public property.

520
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,958
That prison, was paid for
by the taxpayers.

521
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:34,337
So all you have
evidence of,

522
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:36,966
is an exonerated citizen,
standing on a public road,

523
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:38,584
taking pictures
of a public building.

524
00:32:38,883 --> 00:32:41,150
Last I checked,
it's not a crime.

525
00:32:41,636 --> 00:32:43,288
What if I said that
I could get you on attempt,

526
00:32:43,888 --> 00:32:45,456
just for having
all this stuff?

527
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:47,658
What if I told you that all this
was peace offering?

528
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:50,111
The warden won't let me
see my wife.

529
00:32:50,895 --> 00:32:53,034
So I figured, if I found
a few lapses in the security,

530
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:55,221
pointed them out
as a gesture of good faith,

531
00:32:55,758 --> 00:32:56,897
she might change
her mind?

532
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:57,967
Is that so?

533
00:32:58,547 --> 00:32:59,535
<i>Find anything yet?</i>

534
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:01,935
No.
Looks airtight.

535
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,001
Well thank goodness
for that.

536
00:33:05,993 --> 00:33:08,223
<i>You guys will let me know
if anything comes up, right?</i>

537
00:33:08,621 --> 00:33:09,753
You'll be
the first to know.

538
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,021
On the outside, I was known
for getting the job done.

539
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:26,197
No matter what.

540
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:28,023
I got paid well
for it.

541
00:33:28,365 --> 00:33:31,468
Now I'm broke.
But I still need things.

542
00:33:31,785 --> 00:33:34,243
- Like what?
- A favor.

543
00:33:34,538 --> 00:33:36,073
I don't do
favors for cons.

544
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:39,351
Really? It's not what it says
on the bathroom wall.

545
00:33:40,002 --> 00:33:43,860
As I understand, you'd do favors
for those who reciprocate.

546
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:49,229
Is that true?

547
00:33:57,645 --> 00:33:59,222
This is bullshit, Boss!

548
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:01,326
<i>I'm a veteran
around here.</i>

549
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:05,370
<i>Ain't no reason
to toss me!</i>

550
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:06,860
<i>You--</i>

551
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:07,775
Hey!

552
00:34:08,197 --> 00:34:09,198
You low leaf!

553
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:14,245
Looky, looky here.

554
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,068
No!
That brown ain't mine, boss.

555
00:34:16,103 --> 00:34:16,831
<i>You know this!</i>

556
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:18,092
I don't do no drugs!

557
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:19,834
Who put that
in here?!

558
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:22,828
You... ugh!

559
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,765
Get your hands off me.
I know where the hole is.

560
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:26,457
What y'all looking at?

561
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:28,300
I do no drugs!

562
00:34:28,748 --> 00:34:30,386
Somebody is going
down there!

563
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:31,637
I love you too.

564
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:35,785
Sofia's making arrangements
in Central America.

565
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,910
Once we break Sara,
we're on the boat, we're gone.

566
00:34:40,437 --> 00:34:41,689
- Hey.
- It's Lou.

567
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,107
Just got the decision
from the court.

568
00:34:43,274 --> 00:34:45,733
They're ordering the warden
to allow a supervised visitation.

569
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,322
- Where are you going?
- They're letting me see Sara.

570
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,740
<i>Pera, pera, pera, pera--</i>

571
00:34:52,783 --> 00:34:54,299
If they're going to be listening
to every word you say,

572
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:55,621
you gotta be careful
about this.

573
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,786
If she understood my letters,
she'll find a way to tell me.

574
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:01,158
How? She's going to blink
the Morse code?

575
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,303
<i>Attention, inmates...</i>

576
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,353
<i>Visiting hours will be over
in five minutes.</i>

577
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:26,600
Oh my God!

578
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:33,606
Oh my God!
Who did this to you?

579
00:35:33,689 --> 00:35:35,984
I'm okay.
Baby's okay.

580
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,851
Sara,
I'm so sorry.

581
00:35:38,955 --> 00:35:40,296
You're in here
because of me.

582
00:35:44,617 --> 00:35:46,004
I'm sorry.
This is hard.

583
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,289
- <i>I miss you so much</i>
- No touching!

584
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:54,794
<i>I miss you too.</i>

585
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:58,988
You just have
to hang in there, okay?

586
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:03,361
I'm trying.
But my protection's gone.

587
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,891
- Did you get my letter?
- I did.

588
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,671
I know sometimes it's hard for me
to express what I want to say.

589
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:17,016
But I hope you understood...
what I meant to tell you.

590
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:18,983
I did.

591
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:23,324
Is he getting cute?

592
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,055
You were there for me.
And I will be there for you.

593
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:31,896
- Okay.
- Alright, that's it.

594
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:34,301
Time's up.

595
00:36:36,252 --> 00:36:37,336
See you soon.

596
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:44,867
Bye.

597
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:05,448
Michael.

598
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:10,757
<i>I was thinking a lot.</i>

599
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:13,708
About the photos and the mock-up
that you showed me at the loft.

600
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:15,432
And I ran a few tests.

601
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:17,943
Lo and behold,
I've found a blindspot.

602
00:37:18,394 --> 00:37:20,963
Right along the fence line over here,
due to our retrofit.

603
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:23,209
You didn't know
about this, did you?

604
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:25,978
No, no,
of course not.

605
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:27,082
Because you would've
told me or

606
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,643
<i>the warden about it
if you did, right?</i>

607
00:37:29,222 --> 00:37:31,246
Well, it's a good thing
I found this when I did,

608
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:33,005
before anyone tried
to escape.

609
00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:43,555
Well if we can't go
through the fence,

610
00:37:43,556 --> 00:37:45,127
then that leaves
under or over.

611
00:37:45,245 --> 00:37:48,123
Look, how's she gonna climb
that fence without being seen, huh?

612
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,128
I'm guessing
there's no telephone wire

613
00:37:50,163 --> 00:37:51,257
for her
to climb across.

614
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:54,129
- Then she's gotta go under.
- Alright, let's get some shovels--

615
00:37:54,646 --> 00:37:56,484
What was that you were saying
about parachutes?

616
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:57,403
Parachutes--

617
00:37:58,091 --> 00:37:59,162
Guys, come on.

618
00:37:59,187 --> 00:38:01,413
You can't be--
Parachutes?

619
00:38:01,428 --> 00:38:02,453
<i>Couple of thoughts
on that.</i>

620
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:03,468
<i>A:
We don't have a plane,</i>

621
00:38:03,503 --> 00:38:04,582
B:
We don't have a pilot.

622
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:06,690
Have you ever worn
a parachute?

623
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:08,899
Don't worry.
I think I've got a plan.

624
00:38:09,894 --> 00:38:11,924
But we're gonna need some help
from an old friend.

625
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:13,265
Who?

626
00:38:13,898 --> 00:38:17,356
- You want a favor from me.
- Just hear me out.

627
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:19,028
Of course.
I mean...

628
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:21,523
When you and Michael send me
back to that prison,

629
00:38:21,558 --> 00:38:23,767
you did give me
a piece of chewing gum.

630
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,997
I mean what kind of man
would I be

631
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:26,411
if I didn't
quit your pro-quote.

632
00:38:26,592 --> 00:38:27,412
Look,

633
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:30,081
all you gotta do is sound off
the fire alarm, in here,

634
00:38:30,116 --> 00:38:31,969
tomorrow night
at 7:30.

635
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:34,419
That's it.

636
00:38:34,753 --> 00:38:36,223
You're breaking her out.

637
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:37,940
Krantz has put
a hit on her.

638
00:38:38,631 --> 00:38:40,082
That's our one shot,

639
00:38:41,342 --> 00:38:42,684
of keeping her alive.

640
00:38:43,136 --> 00:38:45,935
Well you're on a pivoted
kind of damn, Lincoln.

641
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,923
We'll put five grand on your cake
once this whole thing jumps off.

642
00:38:49,434 --> 00:38:52,832
The love of Michael's life
is only worth $5,000?

643
00:38:52,854 --> 00:38:54,085
That's the best
we can do.

644
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:56,858
- I need six figures.
- That's all we got.

645
00:38:57,484 --> 00:38:58,847
Well,
like a day for you,

646
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:02,281
I know somebody who does...
the General's man.

647
00:39:04,491 --> 00:39:07,118
He's got to pay out
for Sara's hit.

648
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,267
You wire that money
to me by 7 PM tomorrow,

649
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:12,551
and we're in business.

650
00:39:13,032 --> 00:39:13,583
What's his name?

651
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:15,884
It's your brother to you
that agony is.

652
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:17,095
Come on, you gotta give me
more than that.

653
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,431
Tomorrow. 7 PM.
Go on, fetch.

654
00:39:32,435 --> 00:39:34,273
You should have seen
the look on Michael's face.

655
00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:36,897
When he saw me fixing that fence
and installing that camera.

656
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:39,680
You did a great job.

657
00:39:41,486 --> 00:39:42,863
Job's over now.

658
00:39:43,655 --> 00:39:47,905
If Michael has this misguided belief
that Sara's life is in danger,

659
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:50,787
he's gonna find a way back
into that prison.

660
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:53,748
Your job will be over until
you give us enough evidence

661
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:55,521
to put him back
behind bars.

662
00:39:56,835 --> 00:39:58,002
So what's the latest?

663
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:00,045
There's nothing concrete.

664
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:02,019
But I'll let you know
when I get something.

665
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:05,044
Alright.
Good man.

666
00:40:26,402 --> 00:40:27,493
<i>I warned you.</i>

667
00:40:30,493 --> 00:40:31,619
Tough going alone.

668
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:35,161
I know he's breaking you out.
I'm coming with you.

669
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:42,249
Relax.

670
00:40:43,017 --> 00:40:44,017
Krantz sent me
to kill you,

671
00:40:44,052 --> 00:40:46,551
but after what he's put me through,
I'm done taking orders from him.

672
00:40:46,634 --> 00:40:47,867
You're sitting next to me
at the mess

673
00:40:47,902 --> 00:40:48,470
when I was poisoned.

674
00:40:48,803 --> 00:40:50,211
You'd think you would've
lasted this long

675
00:40:50,246 --> 00:40:51,101
if I wanted you dead?

676
00:40:51,556 --> 00:40:53,391
I want you dead.
You're still alive.

677
00:40:53,475 --> 00:40:55,643
Do you think it's hard to stay alive
when you know who's coming after you?

678
00:40:56,144 --> 00:40:58,148
There's 200 women
in this prison.

679
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:00,940
Could you even get
to Gen Pop?

680
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:07,264
I'm coming with you.

681
00:41:08,073 --> 00:41:09,496
Or nobody's going.

682
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:18,315
