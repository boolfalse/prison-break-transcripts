1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,990
previously on prison break:

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,070
From now on, I'm asking that
everyone keep their card on them.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,310
At all times.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,840
Gretchen didn't get us the sixth card.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,730
So where does that leave us?

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,240
You know, gretchen did pass on this
one piece of information for you.

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,420
It's gonna be helpful.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,290
I got a call from an old friend, heard scylla was
in play and he wants to know if he can get in on it.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,170
I've set up a safe house
where you can hearim out.

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,000
- Do you have a pen?
- Just a minute.

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,720
1917 piermt.

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,660
Agent self...

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,350
we've been waiting.

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,340
When scofield and burrows walk rough the
door, give them an opportunity to surrender.

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,090
There's no way they're gonna
hand it over without a fight.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,600
If they take that position,
we'll respond in kind.

17
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,810
We make one wrong move, the camera goes on
and general krantz will know we're inside.

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,980
I need a team downstairs now!

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,920
Shouldn't be long.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,610
You sure we shouldn't be waiting down
there for michael to leave with scylla.

21
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,980
If you knew anything about tactics,
you would know this is the high ground.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,900
Besides we have silencers.

23
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,130
So, scylla isn't one card.

24
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,890
It's six.

25
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,060
Make sure he's not armed with
explosives. Then kill him.

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,900
drop 'em.

27
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,850
Or I bw his head clean off.

28
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,660
You're gonna want to put that down.

29
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,620
You're gonna want to put that down.

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,530
Lower your wpons.

31
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,630
Come on. Get over there.

32
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Get on over there.

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,300
The best minds in the world designed this
security system, and you almost beat it.

34
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,640
The frustration must be killing you.

35
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,040
You blew it.

36
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,130
Actually...

37
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,380
there's only one missing
piece of the puzzle.

38
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,510
And you just brought it to me.

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,570
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

40
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,160
Your scylla card. Now.

Not what you expected?

45
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:13,780
What I expect of a man like you is a
system where you've got all the advantage.

46
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,060
Looks like you're a few cards short.

47
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,250
Suck it, general.

48
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,140
- you're the worst partner I've ever worked with.
- What?

49
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,720
Leaving me with the one-handed freak and
crazy tch, while you hang out with gq...

50
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,010
be quiet. Be quiet.

51
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,810
- Be quiet.
- Don't tell me what to do! You're a coward!

52
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,070
Listen to me.

53
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,950
You think gretchen and bagwell
are gonna get you scylla,

54
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,250
but the people they're gonna
steal it from have a plan ...

55
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,960
- shut up!
- To trick them...

56
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,170
- you shut up!
- okay, be quiet.

57
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,040
Don't tell me To shut up! Don't tell
him anything! I can tell whatever I want!

58
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,660
- Be quiet!
- Don't tell me to shut up!

59
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,150
Don't!

60
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,460
We needed him.

61
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,810
He was going to kill you.

62
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,610
All right, jusgo get gretchen and
bagwell. M gonna take care of this.

63
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,150
Cole, you ought to be ashamed of youelf.

64
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,810
I don't know how things worked
back home, but around here,

65
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,190
we like to give our guest
a proper introduction.

66
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,730
I'm gregory white. Nice to meet you.

67
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,760
Susan anthony.

68
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,500
I've seen you around
the past couple of days.

69
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,370
Are you a prospective client?

70
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,990
Actually, no, I am a former
work colleague of cole'S.

71
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,530
She's a pretty convincing
salesman herself.

72
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,640
Really? Where did you work together?

73
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,760
Florida.

74
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,710
Florida?

75
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,930
Weren't you in the northeast division?

76
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,810
I was. But my very first job
with gate was, uh, in clearwater.

77
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,930
I guess you don't like
to stay put much, do you?

78
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,850
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man.

79
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,590
Well, it was, uh, wonderful
to meet you. I, uh...

80
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,330
I have to go jump on a conference call.

81
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,510
He knows.

82
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,140
No. No. No.

83
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,010
hang it .

84
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,520
Plse, that way. Right in mr. White's office.
Everybody just stay calm. Mr. White's office!

85
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,140
Sit!

86
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,120
Now listen very closely!

87
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,800
No one's gonna get hurt.

88
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,280
Now what?

89
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,730
How... did you get all five cards?

90
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,040
The frustration must be killing you.

91
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,660
Is that...

92
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,410
What is that?

93
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,090
The cards were keys...

94
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,540
and this...

95
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,450
this is scylla.

96
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,630
Guess right noyou wish you'd
framed somebody else, huh, general?

97
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,910
You're not even close
to getting out of here.

98
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,730
Let's go.

99
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,760
You sure, papi?

100
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,020
We have no idea what's
waiting for us back there.

101
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,630
Yeah, but we don't know
what's be up there either.

102
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,920
Trust me.

103
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,420
General, we're gonna need
you to activate this elevator.

104
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,540
Best of luck.

105
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,670
You're coming with us.

106
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,160
It's all right, damani. Put away
the gun. Everything's under control.

107
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,840
We have a major situation.

108
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,420
michael, thank god.

109
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,770
We got it.

110
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,770
How's it going on your end?

111
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,340
Pretty damn good.

112
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,050
But give me five more minutes.

113
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,730
Is that thdesk you sat at when
you told wyatt to kill my son?

114
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,300
Don't worry, alex.

115
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,950
He won't be giving any
more orders after today.

116
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,850
I'm curious.

117
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,180
How do you think you're
getting out of here?

118
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:50,280
The second we stepped off the elevator, my guard
made a call to put the entire building under lockdown.

119
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,370
Nothing gets in or out.

120
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,520
So whatever you're waiting
for-- it isn't coming.

121
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,330
- what are you looking at, huh?
- Nothing. Nothing.

122
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,640
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

123
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,780
don't yobe eyeballing
me, soldier. Back to work.

124
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,410
There's no way this is gonna end well.

125
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,510
We should get out of here.

126
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,740
Don't you think it's worth
20 minutes for $125 million?

127
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,350
Suck it up!

128
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,760
I want a team outside
of the general's office.

129
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,410
We need to get a handle on this.

130
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,880
Check the elevator.

131
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,000
Cover the stairwell.

132
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,790
All that design just to
hold some names and reports.

133
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,090
Names and reports?

134
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:01,250
Is that informatn from the
government, or your father?

135
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,250
Careful.

136
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,890
Top right-hand drawer.

137
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,390
It's something that should
be of interest to you.

138
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,960
I pulled it when your mes came up.

139
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,780
Lincoln: Why did you leave?

140
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,380
I took a position with a group of
multinationals we call the company.

141
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,570
They call every shot this country takes.

142
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:30,330
I knew your father since before you were
born u do know he worked for the company?

143
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,950
Yeah. He was data analyst.

144
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,060
Is that what he told you?

145
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,280
Well, it makes sense.

146
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,000
He wanteto protect you from the truth.

147
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,010
I'm warning you.

148
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:47,370
Your father was a brilliant man, but he
could never have defeated the company.

149
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:53,290
You don't have to make the same
misguided, fatal mistake that he did.

150
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,630
There's so much you don't
know about the company...

151
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,530
about scylla...

152
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,510
about your dad...

153
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,140
about your mother.

154
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,730
I swear to god, I'll kill you.

155
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,770
let's get through this.

156
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,850
What's the plan?

157
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,120
agent self?

158
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,020
Where are we?

159
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,960
The men went i about two hours ago.

160
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,110
No confirmation on whether
they've gotten scylla?

161
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,460
Not yet, but I promise you, herb,
you'll be the first to know, okay?

162
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,560
And as soon as I get word, I'm taking
an unmarked car to the pickup location,

163
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,240
- and then I'm gonna head bk over...
- no.

164
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,290
You go directlyto
senator dallow's office.

165
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,790
I'll have the attorney
general standing by.

166
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,140
We can't veer from the plan
here. It's too dangerous.

167
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,680
Yes, sir. We're almost
at the finish line.

168
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,180
I know.

169
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,690
I never thought you'd make it this far.

170
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,270
I was wrong.

171
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,140
We need to be prepared to go in as
soon as the general gives the order.

172
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,810
what is it you all want?

173
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,290
Fernando.Just say the word,

174
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,150
and your little girl's
college education is paid for.

175
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,590
We'll buy her a house to grow up in.

176
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,400
You think you can just
throw some cash at us, huh?

177
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,240
We'll forget everything, call it a day?

178
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,130
Pam needs you, alex.

179
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Now more than ever.

180
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,310
You're both still hurting,
but given time, it'll pass.

181
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,340
And maybe some day you'll be ready to
bparents again, and if money is no object...

182
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,620
you should hear yourself right now.

183
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,360
The desperation in
your voice. You hear it?

184
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,660
But listen to what it is I'm saying.

185
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,890
Get away from me.

186
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,720
- Whatever you want...
- get away from me.

187
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:18,520
Whatever you want, i can provide.

188
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,460
Airle tickets for u and
sara anywhere in the world.

189
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,750
What I want is to see the
company burn to the ground,

190
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,770
and you in prison.

191
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,110
It's what we all want.

192
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,290
That'll never happen.

193
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,860
- I am so sorry.
- Please back off.

194
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,840
Excuse me. Let me help
you get some of that off.

195
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,180
You know what? Stop. Just...

196
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,400
Don't worry about it.

197
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,920
- Are you okay?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

198
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,890
Thank U.

199
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,040
Damn it.

200
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,640
Everybody get into position.

201
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,060
This is going to end very soon,
and it's not going to be pretty.

202
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,470
One last chance.

203
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,540
Lee scylla, and you can all go free.

204
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,990
Just walk out the door.

205
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,190
Where are you going?

206
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,420
You shoot me, and then what?

207
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,250
You jump out the window
of my 19th floor office?

208
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,280
Michael, you kill me,
you lose your levera.

209
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,460
hello?

210
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,710
it's for you.

211
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,210
Oh, what is this?

212
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,920
Leverage.

213
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,270
It's me.

214
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,330
Lisa?

215
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,650
I'm at gunpoint.

216
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,930
What's going on?

217
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,570
It's tancredi.

218
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,030
She ys if you don't let michael and the
others leave with scylla, she'll kill me.

219
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,560
Dad?

220
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,290
Please.

221
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,700
Do what they want.

222
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,600
I suggest you take your
daughter's advice, general.

223
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,160
You son of a bitch.

224
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,300
Lisa, where you are?

225
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,500
Get her back on the phone!

226
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,830
You can talk to your daughter after
we've left with scylla, of course.

227
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,000
Look, I read enough intel on
your girlfriend to know th *****

228
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,470
maybe...

229
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,820
three months ago, but she's changed.

230
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,560
We've all changed.

231
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,090
This is a list of
everyone you've killed.

232
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,140
Fathers, sons, friends.

233
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,750
Do you really ink your daughter's
life is worth any more than theirs?

234
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,430
One of two things is
going to happen now.

235
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,160
You're going to let us
go, or lisa will die.

236
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,390
Either one is fine with me.

237
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,030
Just don't hurt R.

238
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,330
As long as you hold up your
end of the deal, we won'T.

239
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,600
You ordered scylla to be moved.

240
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,490
Show us how.

241
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,070
I'm walking them out!

242
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,630
Stand down. Stand down.

243
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,260
Yes, sir.

244
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,120
They must have found another way out.

245
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,010
That's impossible.

246
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,170
Well, then, they're caught or dead.
How much longer are we gonna wait?

247
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,910
You were the one who
said scofield had a plan.

248
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,110
And you put a gun in mr. White's face!

249
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,000
He was going to call the police.

250
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,820
It's okay. It's okay. Federal agent.

251
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,070
Quick. I'll help you. Quick.
Help me untie the others.

252
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,680
Okay, I'll keep an eye
on cole and the woman.

253
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,190
I want you to slip out two at
a time. Okay, you two first.

254
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,710
Why can't we all go together?

255
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,730
You're here. Go arrest them.

256
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,560
I want to get out as many of you as possible
before they realize what's happening.

257
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,700
Theodore bagwell's wanted for murder.

258
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,970
Now cole pfeiffer's a hostage-taker.

259
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,390
What am I gonna do?

260
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,680
You're gonna run for
your life, you idiot.

261
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,830
I'm leaving.

262
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,150
No, mr. White. No, mr. White. Wait!

263
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,470
No! Wait!

264
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,070
Everybody stay down! Drop yr weapon!

265
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,790
call 911!

266
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,860
How does it feel,huh?

267
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,200
Being forced to do something you don't want to do?

268
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,790
But knowing that if you don't go through with it,

269
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,510
someone you care about is gonna suffer; they're gonna pay?

270
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,630
what goes around,comes around,huh,general?

271
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,670
I...I can't imagine what you've been through.

272
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,540
I can't imagine that you'd want to.

273
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,810
Whatever they've done to you...

274
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,750
"they" are you,my friend.

275
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,280
Whatever they've told you,you need to realize that...

276
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,580
scofield and burws are bad men.

277
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,430
you used to be doctor.

278
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,250
You devoted your whole life helpg other people.

279
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,250
Now look at you.

280
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,420
They have you holding a gun on an innocent woman.

281
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,590
So you're innocent?

282
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,090
You're jus.

283
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,350
crunching numbers and running data to make the world a better place?

284
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,510
Mrs. Tabak?

285
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,210
You're fine.You need a couple of minutes.

286
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,970
hello,mrs. Tabak?

287
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,060
You okay?

288
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,790
Say it.

289
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm soaking my skirt.

290
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:52,500
If I d't get the grease out before it gets to the cleaners,it'll be ruined.

291
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,800
Okay,ma'am.

292
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,300
I don't know what it looks like up there in your ivory tower.

293
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,930
Down on the ground,men and women are dying and lives are being ruined.

294
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:09,290
So,I'm prepared to do absolutely anything in order to stop you.

295
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,610
Turn around.

296
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,850
Turn...around,lisa.

297
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,590
you should've let me try to convince mr. White that everything was gonna be okay.

298
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,970
- That way,I could've...- what?

299
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,100
Put on a monkey suit every day and sit behind a desk.

300
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,130
How long you think that's gonna last?

301
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,860
you gonna walk down the street with an mp-5?

302
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,970
You can't be serious.

303
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,760
They can identify you,cole.

304
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,240
You're the only one linking me to that crime scene.

305
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,460
But,hey,it was nice working with you.

306
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,510
don't move!

307
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,340
Turn around.Turn around!

308
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,610
Gently now,sugar.

309
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,640
That's speci agent miriam holtz to you,sugar.

310
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,510
Let's go.

311
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,280
I want to speakwith my daughter,get confirmation that she's being released.

312
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,590
Sara will be keeping your daughter in custody

313
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,910
until she knows we're safely away from this place with nobody trailing us.

314
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,730
Company agents aren't just embedded in the fbi and the secret service.

315
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,710
They're in local l enforcement,hpils,dmv.

316
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,150
You'll never see us coming.

317
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,700
Actually,once we get scylla into the right hands,alyour agents,all your operations--

318
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,590
it'll all be out in the open,and then everyone...

319
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,800
will see you coming.

320
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,600
We did this to you.

321
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,770
We did this to you.

322
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,030
Don't you forget that,old man.

323
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,060
Want to know what your father really did for the company?

324
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,570
He was an executioner.

325
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,900
He killed people who defected from the company.

326
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,970
And now the men he trained will be coming after Y.

327
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,600
come on.Something's not right.

328
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,250
Mrs. Tabak?

329
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,900
Mrs. Tabak?

330
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,990
she just left-- tancredi-- she has to be right outside.

331
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,700
are you all right?

332
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,290
Yeah,I'm fine.I'm fine.

333
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,540
I'm heading back now.

334
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,850
No.I want you in a secure location,under supervision.

335
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,190
- You go home.- But I really need to be there.

336
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,490
I'll call youonce we get scylla back.

337
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,330
We've given the truck's license plate and vin number to the local police...

338
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:54,470
we lost our tactical initiative the minute that scoeld figured out our sops.

339
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,740
If we want to defeat him,we've got to alter our way of operating...

340
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,000
become unpredictable.

341
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,970
it's them.

342
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:19,850
Michael,where are you?

343
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,430
The company's armored truck.

344
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,320
We havit.

345
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,880
They got it.Okay,listen.

346
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,340
Michael,stay on alert,okay?

347
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,950
I will.

348
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,950
See you at the rendezvous.

349
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,140
You guys get someplace safe.Wait till you hear from us.

350
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,090
- You got it.- Good luck,bobby.

351
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,290
the rport.

352
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,210
We have visual confirmation.

353
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,970
Make sure not a single plane leaves the ground before we've got them.

354
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,590
Understood,sir.

355
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,270
Stay with scofield and burrows.

356
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,310
Scylla's the priority.

357
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,660
Attention,ladies and gentlemen,due to technical issues,

358
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,800
all flights have been temporarily grounded.

359
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,250
Check it out.

360
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,400
They're rit behind us.

361
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,470
Let's go.

362
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,400
Hey,my name's john burton.

363
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,530
I'm an off-duty cop from chicago.

364
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,100
Listen,I'm walking throh ontario airport,terminal 2,

365
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,560
right by the ticket counters and I just saw something that you guys definitely want check out.

366
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,780
We got company.

367
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,100
Michael scofield and lincoln burrows.

368
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,230
- Let's get out of here.- No,no,no...

369
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,940
the last thing you want to do right now is run

370
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,570
why is that?You gonna shoot us?

371
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,890
Yeah.

372
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,620
I say the word and my men will take you both out.

373
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,250
In front of all these people?

374
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,800
You'd never risk that kind of exposure.

375
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,170
I think it's clear by now that you've miscalculated how far 're willing to go.

376
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,470
Give me the bag.

377
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,280
Give me the bag.

378
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,950
Now.

379
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,400
Tell krantz this isn't finished.

380
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,580
Oh,you can tell him in person.

381
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,760
Sir?Please come with us.

382
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,080
Excuse me?

383
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,500
Just a security precaution.

384
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,680
- Yeah,sure.- *******

385
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,400
is this really necessary?

386
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,050
Please empty the contents of your bag.

387
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:19,110
Look,all I've got in there is a laptop and an external hard drive.

388
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,150
I'm telling you,you've got the wrong guy.

389
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,280
Let go of the bag,sir.

390
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,280
***********

391
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,830
yeah?

392
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,080
Well?

393
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,480
Yeah,we got it.

394
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,010
so you knew who I was from the start,huh?

395
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,000
My real name,my record...

396
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,340
I read your file,yeah.

397
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,280
What if you hadn't?

398
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,120
What's your point?

399
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,880
What if you never knew I was theodore bagwell,the convict?

400
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,600
Would you have believed I was cole pfeiffer?

401
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,790
Stellar salesman...

402
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,510
talented speaker?

403
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,710
I don't know.

404
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,690
You certainly had a lot of other people fooled,though.

405
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,390
Till you pled a machine gun on them.

406
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,860
I guess it's like they said over at gate:

407
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:51,210
"We are captives of our own identities

408
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:55,560
living in prisons of our own creation."

409
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,200
who would've thought they'd actually be right about something?

410
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,010
So if u drop this,does thamean we all go back to prison?

411
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,810
Don't worry.

412
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,460
If this doesn't get in the right hands in one piece,I'm going to be in as bad a spot as you are.

413
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,660
Congratulations.

414
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,550
What now?

415
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,060
Now,I live up to my end of the deal.

416
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,020
The vans are going to be here in a half an hour.

417
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,770
They're going to be sent to a field office where you can go through processing.

418
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,310
Th is all your transfer paperrk.

419
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,980
Get this to an agent schmidt.

420
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,810
He's going to be heading up the convoy.

421
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,720
I wish I could drive you myself,but I need to get to dallow asap.

422
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,390
Are you okay?

423
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,650
Yeah,I'm okay.

424
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,560
No,he's not.He needs to go to a hospital.

425
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,530
All right,I'm going to send an ambulance with the vans.

426
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,200
You're going to get the best medical care available.

427
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,390
Thk you.

428
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,870
No,I should be thanking you.

429
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,890
Okay,because of what you've done,lives are going to be changed forever.

430
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:39,310
listen,I need a,uh,ambulance to come with the convoy.

431
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,930
Sir,what are your orders?

432
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,260
Sir?

433
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,350
I don't know.

434
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,610
None of us will ever have to look over ourshoulders again.

435
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,640
That's the most important thing.

436
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,440
No matter what comes next.

437
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,880
You're gonna make it,michael.

438
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,320
You'll have the operation and,and you'll get through this.

439
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,220
Just like we've gotten through everything else.

440
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,440
She's worried about you.

441
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,780
It's nice to know that the next time I want to drink one of these,

442
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,620
I won't have to drink it in this crappy warehouse.

443
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,850
Yeah.

444
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:17,410
I can't even remember being able to sit down at a restaurant or go to a bl game.

445
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,190
God...it seems like I've been running forever.

446
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,580
But time to stand still.

447
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,610
Take in the sun.

448
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,970
Salud.

449
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,980
I know I'm supposed to be happy right now.

450
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,980
I'm still scared.

451
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,900
I'm scared we're going to have come all this way and I'm going to lose you anyway.

452
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,000
Come here.

453
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,770
Come on.Sara...

454
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,570
just don't tell me that everything's going to be okay,please.

455
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,830
Okay.

456
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,210
I won'T.

457
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,280
I see you brought your friend along.

458
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,710
What happened to gretchen?

459
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,400
Uh,she got away.

460
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,040
So here it is.

461
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,420
Oh,my god.

462
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,420
I can't believe it so what's next?

463
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,930
Senator dallow?

464
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,050
No,I need to tie up some loose ends.

465
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,820
Did gretchen and bagwell say anything else about scylla in terms of other buyers?

466
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,950
- Feng.- He's dead.

467
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,480
They didn't talk to anyone else?

468
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,220
We need to get as many indictments on this thing as possible.

469
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,130
Well,bagwell might know.

470
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,880
Once we get him in an interview room and offer him a deal,his mouth will start moving.

471
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,080
Remember wt I said to you the first y we got here?

472
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,890
Yeah,you said that when this was over,we were gonna settle up.

473
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,620
We're settled.

474
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,540
Michael.

475
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,300
It's been an hour.Would you call self and check on that ambulance?

476
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,680
is he not picking up?

477
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,650
Maybe something's wrong with the signal.

478
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:11,460
The number you have reached is notn service at this time and there is no new number.

479
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,640
What is it?
