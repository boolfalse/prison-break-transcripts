1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,218
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:09,379
From now on, I'm asking that everyone
keep their card on them at all times.

3
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:10,888
Gretchen didn't get the card.

4
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:14,790
- Where does that leave us?
- Gretchen did pass on information for you.

5
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:17,328
This could be helpful.

6
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:21,935
I got a call from a friend.
Heard Scylla was in play.

7
00:00:22,103 --> 00:00:26,130
<i>He wants to get in on it. I've set up a safe
house. We can hear him out. Have a pen?</i>

8
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:28,832
<i>- Just a minute.
- 1917 Piermont.</i>

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,314
Agent Self.

10
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,283
We've been waiting.

11
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:40,353
When Scofield and Burrows walk through,
give them an opportunity to surrender.

12
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:42,990
No way they're gonna hand it over
without a fight.

13
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:46,150
If they take that position,
we'll respond in kind.

14
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:49,489
<i>We make one wrong move...</i>

15
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:53,657
<i>... the camera goes on,
and General Krantz knows we're inside.</i>

16
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,801
I need a team downstairs. Now.

17
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:27,965
Shouldn't be long.

18
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:34,504
You sure we shouldn't be waiting
down there for Michael to leave with Scylla?

19
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:37,974
If you knew anything about tactics,
you'd know this is the high ground.

20
00:01:38,146 --> 00:01:40,205
Besides, we have silencers.

21
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:53,758
<i>So Scylla's isn't one card.</i>

22
00:01:55,263 --> 00:01:56,992
It's six.

23
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,171
Make sure he's not armed
with explosives. Then kill him.

24
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:24,590
Drop them, or I blow his head clean off.

25
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:28,285
You're gonna wanna put that down.

26
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,728
You're gonna wanna put that down.

27
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:37,628
Lower your weapons.

28
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:40,702
Come on. Get over there.

29
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:43,672
Come on, old man.

30
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,442
The best minds in the world
designed this security system...

31
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:54,053
...and you almost beat it.

32
00:02:56,424 --> 00:02:58,517
Frustration must be killing you.

33
00:02:58,693 --> 00:02:59,785
You blew it.

34
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:01,925
Actually...

35
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:05,289
...there's only one missing piece
of the puzzle.

36
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,491
And you just brought it to me.

37
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:11,333
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

38
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:13,868
Your Scylla card.

39
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:15,600
Now.

40
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:08,325
Not what you expected.

41
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,131
What I expected of a man like you
is a system...

42
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:15,329
...where you've got all the advantage.

43
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:23,569
Looks like you're a few cards short.

44
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:36,347
Suck it, general.

45
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,697
You're the worst partner
I've ever worked with.

46
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:53,431
- What?
- You leaving me...

47
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:55,838
...with the one-handed freak
and crazy bitch...

48
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,001
...while you hang out with GQ.
- Be quiet.

49
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:01,114
- Don't tell me what to do. You're a coward.
- Be quiet.

50
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:04,945
Listen to me. You think Gretchen
and Bagwell are gonna get you Scylla...

51
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:08,452
...but the people they're gonna steal it from
have a plan to trick them.

52
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:10,716
- Okay, be quiet.
- Don't tell me to shut up!

53
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:13,224
- Shut your mouth!
- I can tell them whatever I want.

54
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:15,123
- Be quiet.
- Don't tell me to shut up!

55
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:29,972
Hey! Don't...

56
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:48,989
- We needed him.
- He was gonna kill you.

57
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:52,291
All right. Go get Gretchen and Bagwell.
I'm gonna take care of this.

58
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:59,930
Cole. You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

59
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:05,745
I don't know how things work back home,
but around here we like to give our guests...

60
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:07,141
...a proper introduction.

61
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:09,840
- I'm Gregory White. Nice to meet you.
- Susan Anthony.

62
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:13,350
I've seen you around the past couple days.
Are you a prospective client?

63
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:16,285
Actually, no,
I'm a former work colleague of Cole's.

64
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:18,516
She's a pretty convincing salesman,
herself.

65
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,854
Really. Where did you work together?

66
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:24,989
Florida.

67
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,664
Florida?

68
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:29,894
Weren't you in the Northeast Division?

69
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:34,633
I was, but my very first job with GATE
was in Clearwater.

70
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,335
I guess you don't like to stay put much,
do you?

71
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:40,980
Lord, I was born a rambling man.

72
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:45,045
Well, it was wonderful to meet you. I...

73
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,345
I have to go jump on a conference call,
so...

74
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:56,957
He knows.

75
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:04,703
No. No. No.

76
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:07,697
What are you doing?

77
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:09,836
Get down.

78
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:11,672
Get down! Get down.

79
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:13,609
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

80
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:18,585
Hang it up.

81
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:21,753
Please, that way.
In Mr. White's office. Stay calm.

82
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:23,390
- Mr. White's office.
- Sit.

83
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:26,994
Now, listen very closely.
No one's gonna get hurt.

84
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:29,055
Now what?

85
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:43,169
How did you get all five cards?

86
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:46,178
The frustration must be killing you.

87
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:09,360
Is that?

88
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,328
What is that?

89
00:08:11,505 --> 00:08:13,769
The cards were keys.

90
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:16,372
And this...

91
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,146
This is Scylla.

92
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:24,546
Guess right now you wish
you'd framed somebody else, huh?

93
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,485
You're not even close
to getting out of here.

94
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,189
Let's go.

95
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,694
<i>You sure, papi?</i>

96
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:42,131
We have no idea
what's waiting for us back there.

97
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:44,567
- We don't know what's up there either.
- Trust me.

98
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:49,133
General. We're gonna need you
to activate this elevator.

99
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,151
Best of luck.

100
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,651
You're coming with us.

101
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,171
It's all right, Damani. Put away the gun.
Everything's under control.

102
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,614
We have a major situation.

103
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:47,696
Michael, thank God.

104
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:50,300
We got it.

105
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:53,396
How's it going on your end?

106
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:55,136
Pretty damn good.

107
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:57,308
<i>But give me five more minutes.</i>

108
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:33,875
Is that the desk you sat at
when you told Wyatt to kill my son?

109
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:39,409
Don't worry, Alex. He won't be giving
any more orders after today.

110
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:42,887
I'm curious.

111
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:45,184
How do you think
you're getting out of here?

112
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:48,394
The second we stepped off the elevator...

113
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:51,793
...my guard made a call
to put the entire building under lockdown.

114
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,260
Nothing gets in or out.

115
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:58,461
So whatever you're waiting for...

116
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,370
...it isn't coming.

117
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,375
- What are you looking at, huh?
- Nothing. Nothing.

118
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,708
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

119
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:21,445
Don't you be eyeballing me, soldier.
Back to work.

120
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:29,558
There's no way this is gonna end well.
We should get out of here.

121
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,632
Don't you think it's worth it
to wait 10 minutes for $ 125 million?

122
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,530
Suck it up.

123
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:42,365
I want a team outside the general's office.
We need to get a handle on this.

124
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:44,408
Check the elevator.

125
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,005
Cover the stairwell.

126
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:55,320
All that design
just to hold some names and reports.

127
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,051
Names and reports?

128
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:01,524
Is that information
from the government...

129
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,659
...or your father?

130
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:08,464
- Careful.
- Top right-hand drawer.

131
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:12,297
Something that should be of interest
to you.

132
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:15,465
I pulled it when your names came up.

133
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:18,775
<i>Why'd you leave?</i>

134
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:23,440
I took a position with a group
of multinationals we call the Company.

135
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:25,847
They call every shot this country takes.

136
00:13:26,587 --> 00:13:29,681
I knew your father
since before you were born.

137
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,090
You do know
he worked for the Company?

138
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,189
Yeah. He was a data analyst.

139
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,098
Is that what he told you?

140
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,932
Well, it makes sense.
He wanted to protect you from the truth.

141
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:46,595
- I'm warning you.
- Your father was a brilliant man.

142
00:13:46,774 --> 00:13:49,208
But he could never have defeated
the Company.

143
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:55,205
You don't have to make the same
misguided, fatal mistake that he did.

144
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:58,545
There's so much you don't know
about the Company.

145
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,516
About Scylla.

146
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:02,451
About your dad.

147
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:03,954
About your mother.

148
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:05,955
I swear to God, I'll kill you.

149
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,090
Come on, let's get through this.

150
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,128
What's the plan?

151
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:27,744
Agent Self?

152
00:14:28,248 --> 00:14:30,876
- Where are we?
- The men went in about two hours ago.

153
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:33,144
No confirmation
whether they've gotten Scylla?

154
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,448
Not yet. But I promise you, Herb,
you'll be the first to know, okay?

155
00:14:36,623 --> 00:14:39,683
And as soon as I get word,
I'm taking a car to the pickup location.

156
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,261
- Then I'm gonna head back...
- No. Go directly to Senator Dallow's office.

157
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,660
I'll have the attorney general
standing by.

158
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:48,197
We can't veer from the plan here.
It's dangerous.

159
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,859
Yes, sir.

160
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:53,302
- We're almost at the finish line.
- I know.

161
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,877
I never thought you'd make it this far.

162
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,703
I was wrong.

163
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:07,952
We need to be prepared to go in
as soon as the general gives the order.

164
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:35,146
What is it you all want?

165
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:39,151
Fernando, just say the word...

166
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,048
...and your little girl's college education
is paid for.

167
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:46,318
- We'll buy her a house to grow up in.
- You think you can just throw cash at us?

168
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:48,859
We'll forget everything, call it a day?

169
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:52,059
Pam needs you, Alex.

170
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:53,824
Now, more than ever.

171
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:56,226
You're both still hurting.

172
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:58,234
But given time, it'll pass.

173
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:00,873
And maybe someday
you'll be ready to be parents again.

174
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,738
- And if money is no object...
- You should hear yourself right now.

175
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:07,577
The desperation in your voice.

176
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:10,444
- You hear it?
- But listen to what it is I'm saying.

177
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:11,843
Get away from me.

178
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,453
- Whatever you want...
- Get away from me.

179
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:20,920
Whatever you want, I can provide.

180
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:26,396
Airline tickets for you and Sara.
Anywhere in the world.

181
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:28,467
What I want...

182
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:31,103
...is to see the Company
burn to the ground...

183
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:33,236
...and you in prison.

184
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:37,043
It's what we all want.

185
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:41,172
That'll never happen.

186
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,519
Hello. How have you been?

187
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:51,055
- Fine. Thank you.
- Good.

188
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:57,496
- I am so sorry.
- Back off.

189
00:16:58,098 --> 00:16:59,895
Let me help you
get some of that off.

190
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:01,329
You know what? Stop. Just...

191
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:06,268
Don't worry about it.

192
00:17:07,674 --> 00:17:09,972
- You okay?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

193
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:11,611
Thank you.

194
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,484
Damn it.

195
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:32,963
Everybody get into position.

196
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,264
This is going to end very soon.

197
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:41,373
And it's not going to be pretty.

198
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:44,170
One last chance.

199
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:49,209
Leave Scylla, and you can all go free.

200
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:53,182
Just walk out the door.

201
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,227
- Where you going?
- You shoot me, and then what?

202
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,727
You jump out the window
of my 19th-floor office?

203
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:10,459
Michael, you kill me,
you lose your leverage.

204
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,032
Hello?

205
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:25,477
- It's for you.
- Oh, what is this?

206
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,344
Leverage.

207
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:31,523
<i>- It's me.
- Lisa?</i>

208
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:36,529
I'm at gunpoint.

209
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:37,857
<i>What's going on?</i>

210
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:39,498
It's Tancredi.

211
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:43,693
She says if you don't let Michael and
the others leave with Scylla, she'll kill me.

212
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:49,165
Dad?

213
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:53,379
<i>Please.</i>

214
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,542
Do what they want.

215
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:05,290
I suggest you take your daughter's advice,
general.

216
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:07,025
You son of a bitch.

217
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:16,195
Lisa, where are you?

218
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,598
Get her back on the phone!

219
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:21,434
You can talk to your daughter
after we've left with Scylla, of course.

220
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:28,312
Look, I read enough intel on your girlfriend
to know that she wouldn't hurt a fly.

221
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:29,506
Maybe.

222
00:19:29,683 --> 00:19:31,617
Three months ago.

223
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:34,119
But she's changed.

224
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:40,090
We've all changed.
This is a list of everyone you've killed.

225
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,922
Fathers, sons...

226
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:44,859
...friends.

227
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:50,300
Do you really think your daughter's life
is worth any more than theirs?

228
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:54,602
One of two things is going to happen now.
You're going to let us go...

229
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:55,969
...or Lisa will die.

230
00:19:56,343 --> 00:19:58,311
Either one is fine with me.

231
00:19:59,746 --> 00:20:01,737
Just don't hurt her.

232
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:05,983
As long as you hold up
your end of the deal, we won't.

233
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:11,955
You ordered Scylla to be moved.

234
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:14,160
Show us how.

235
00:20:24,104 --> 00:20:26,368
I'm walking them out.

236
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:35,614
Stand down. Stand down.

237
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:36,806
Yes, sir.

238
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:49,992
- They must've found another way out.
- Impossible.

239
00:20:50,163 --> 00:20:52,996
Then they're caught or dead.
How much longer we gonna wait?

240
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:57,030
- You said Scofield had a plan.
- And you put a gun in Mr. White's face.

241
00:20:57,204 --> 00:20:58,967
He was gonna call the police.

242
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:05,842
<i>- It's okay. It's okay. I'm a federal agent.
- What the?</i>

243
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:08,173
Now, quick, I'm gonna help you.

244
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:10,977
All right. Help me untie the others.

245
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:19,222
Okay. I'll keep an eye on Cole
and the woman. Slip out two at a time.

246
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:21,691
- You two first.
- Why can't we all go together?

247
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:23,056
You're here. Arrest them.

248
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,461
I wanna get out as many of you as possible
before they realize.

249
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,567
Theodore Bagwell's wanted for murder.

250
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:32,227
And now Cole Pfeiffer's a hostage taker.
What am I gonna do?

251
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:35,773
You're gonna run for your life. You idiot.

252
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:41,872
- I'm leaving.
- No, Mr. White.

253
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:45,244
No, Mr. White. Wait.
No, wait.

254
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:04,368
Everybody, stay down!
Drop your weapons.

255
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:24,220
Call 911.

256
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:33,727
How does it feel, huh?

257
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,266
Being forced to do something
you don't wanna do...

258
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:40,497
...but knowing if you don't go through with
it, someone you care about's gonna suffer?

259
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:45,108
What goes around comes around,
huh, general?

260
00:22:49,683 --> 00:22:51,651
I can't imagine
what you've been through.

261
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:54,913
I can't imagine that you'd want to.

262
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:57,255
Whatever they've done to you...

263
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,088
"They" are you, my friend.

264
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:03,323
Whatever they've told you...

265
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:08,193
...you need to realize
that Scofield and Burrows are bad men.

266
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,632
You used to be a doctor.

267
00:23:14,808 --> 00:23:18,039
You devoted your whole life
to helping other people. Now look at you.

268
00:23:20,213 --> 00:23:23,808
They have you holding a gun
on an innocent woman.

269
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:25,383
So you're innocent?

270
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:27,952
You're just crunching numbers
and running data...

271
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:30,487
...to make the world a better place?

272
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:34,126
Mrs. Tabak?

273
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:37,789
You're fine.
You need a couple of minutes.

274
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:41,230
Hello, Mrs. Tabak?

275
00:23:41,935 --> 00:23:42,959
You okay?

276
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:46,237
Say it.

277
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:50,041
I'm soaking my skirt.

278
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:54,905
If I don't get the grease out
before it gets to the cleaners, it'll be ruined.

279
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:57,540
Okay, ma'am.

280
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:02,287
I don't know what it looks like
up there in your ivory tower.

281
00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:06,221
Down on the ground, men and women
are dying, and lives are being ruined.

282
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,897
So I'm prepared to do absolutely anything
in order to stop you people.

283
00:24:14,534 --> 00:24:15,558
Turn around.

284
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:23,265
Turn around, Lisa.

285
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,295
You should have let me convince Mr. White
everything was gonna be okay. I could've...

286
00:24:43,463 --> 00:24:45,954
What? Put on a suit every day
and sit behind a desk?

287
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:48,498
How long you think that's gonna last?

288
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:52,595
You gonna walk down the street
with an MP5?

289
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:04,613
You can't be serious.

290
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:08,476
They can identify you. You're the only one
linking me to that crime scene.

291
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:11,215
But, hey, it was nice working with you.

292
00:25:41,855 --> 00:25:43,516
Don't move.

293
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:46,587
Turn around.

294
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,091
Turn around.

295
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:49,421
Gentle now, sugar.

296
00:25:49,596 --> 00:25:52,531
That's Special Agent Miriam Holtz
to you, sugar.

297
00:25:52,699 --> 00:25:53,825
Now let's go.

298
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:58,064
I wanna speak with my daughter,
get confirmation that she's being released.

299
00:25:58,238 --> 00:26:00,433
Sara will be keeping your daughter
in custody...

300
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:04,668
...until she knows we're safely away
from this place with nobody trailing us.

301
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:09,540
Company agents aren't just embedded
in the FBI and the Secret Service.

302
00:26:09,716 --> 00:26:13,516
They're in local law enforcement,
hospitals, DMV.

303
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:15,154
You'll never see us coming.

304
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:19,519
Once we get Scylla into the right hands,
all your agents, all your operations...

305
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:23,686
...it'll all be out in the open,
and then everyone will see you coming.

306
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:30,964
We did this to you.

307
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:33,799
We did this to you.

308
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:36,305
Don't you forget that, old man.

309
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:41,208
You wanna know what your father
really did for the Company?

310
00:26:41,748 --> 00:26:46,685
He was an executioner. He killed people
who defected from the Company.

311
00:26:47,787 --> 00:26:50,813
Now the many trained
will be coming after you.

312
00:27:22,522 --> 00:27:24,956
Come on. Something's not right.

313
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:29,755
Mrs. Tabak?

314
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:33,798
Mrs. Tabak?

315
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:55,312
She just left. Tancredi.
She has to be right outside.

316
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:36,423
Are you all right?

317
00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:39,254
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm heading back now.

318
00:28:39,432 --> 00:28:42,697
No. I want you in a secure location,
under supervision.

319
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:45,167
<i>- You go home.
- But I really need to be there.</i>

320
00:28:45,338 --> 00:28:48,933
I'll call you once we get Scylla back.

321
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:53,439
I've given the truck's license plate
and VIN to the police.

322
00:28:53,613 --> 00:28:58,710
We lost our tactical initiative the minute
that Scofield figured out our SOP's.

323
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:03,447
If we want to defeat him,
we've got to alter our way of operating.

324
00:29:03,756 --> 00:29:06,224
Become unpredictable.

325
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:23,871
It's them. Michael, where are you?

326
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:26,273
The Company's armored truck.

327
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:27,845
We have it.

328
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:32,048
They got it. Okay, listen.
Michael, stay on alert, okay?

329
00:29:32,452 --> 00:29:33,817
I will.

330
00:29:33,987 --> 00:29:36,148
See you at the rendezvous.

331
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:27,130
Hey, you guys get someplace safe.

332
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:29,169
Wait till you hear from us.

333
00:30:29,342 --> 00:30:31,401
<i>- You got it.
- Good luck, papi.</i>

334
00:30:35,214 --> 00:30:36,977
<i>- Where are they?
- The airport.</i>

335
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,549
We have visual confirmation.

336
00:30:39,152 --> 00:30:42,747
Make sure not a single plane
leaves the ground before we've got them.

337
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:44,321
<i>Understood, sir.</i>

338
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:48,093
We stay with Scofield and Burrows.
Scylla's the priority.

339
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:03,636
Check it out.

340
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:09,478
They're right behind us.

341
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:14,547
Let's go.

342
00:31:47,153 --> 00:31:49,986
Hey, my name's John Burton.
I'm an off-duty cop from Chicago.

343
00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:54,449
Listen, I'm walking through Ontario Airport,
Terminal 2, right by the ticket counters.

344
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:57,858
I just saw something
that you guys definitely wanna check out.

345
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:01,462
We got company.

346
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:03,894
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows.

347
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,970
- Let's get out of here.
- No, no, no.

348
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:09,506
- The last thing you wanna do is run.
- Why is that? You gonna shoot us?

349
00:32:09,675 --> 00:32:12,303
Yeah. I say the word,
and my men will take you both out.

350
00:32:12,478 --> 00:32:16,209
In front of all these people?
You'd never risk that kind of exposure.

351
00:32:17,116 --> 00:32:21,678
I think it's clear by now that you've
miscalculated how far we're willing to go.

352
00:32:23,122 --> 00:32:24,316
Give me the bag.

353
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:35,892
Give me the bag. Now.

354
00:32:52,452 --> 00:32:56,286
- Tell Krantz this isn't finished.
- Oh, you can tell him in person.

355
00:32:56,456 --> 00:32:58,788
Sir. Please come with us.

356
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:01,688
- Excuse me?
- Just a security precaution.

357
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,736
- Yeah, sure.
- Let's go.

358
00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:19,905
- Is this really necessary?
- Please empty the contents of your bag.

359
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,310
Look, all I've got in there is a laptop
and an external hard drive.

360
00:33:25,084 --> 00:33:27,575
I'm telling you, you got the wrong guy.

361
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:36,288
Let go of the bag, sir.

362
00:33:55,815 --> 00:33:57,680
- Yeah.
- Well?

363
00:33:58,017 --> 00:33:59,712
Yeah, we got it.

364
00:34:09,362 --> 00:34:12,297
So you knew who I was
from the start, huh?

365
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:14,933
My real name, my record.

366
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:17,729
I read your file. Yeah.

367
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:21,305
What if you hadn't?

368
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:23,072
What's your point?

369
00:34:23,242 --> 00:34:27,372
What if you never knew
I was Theodore Bagwell, a convict?

370
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:31,639
Would you have believed
I was Cole Pfeiffer...

371
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:33,842
...a stellar salesman...

372
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:36,382
...a talented speaker?

373
00:34:36,556 --> 00:34:38,854
I don't know.

374
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:42,217
You certainly had a lot
of the people fooled, though.

375
00:34:42,828 --> 00:34:44,659
Until you pulled a machine gun on them.

376
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:50,431
I guess it's like they said over at GATE.

377
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:56,066
We are captives of our own identities...

378
00:34:56,842 --> 00:35:01,176
...living in prisons of our own creation.

379
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:10,912
Who'd have thought
they'd actually be right about something?

380
00:35:12,992 --> 00:35:17,429
So if you drop this, does that mean
we all go back to prison?

381
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:19,489
Don't worry.

382
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:24,528
If this doesn't get in the right hands,
I'm gonna be in as bad a spot as you are.

383
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:28,598
Congratulations.

384
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:34,773
What now?

385
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:39,812
Now I live up to my end of the deal.
The vans are gonna be here in half an hour.

386
00:35:39,986 --> 00:35:43,854
You're gonna be sent to a field office
where you're gonna go through processing.

387
00:35:44,323 --> 00:35:46,086
This is all your transfer paperwork.

388
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:49,422
Give this to an Agent Schmidt.
He's gonna be heading up the convoy.

389
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:53,856
I wish I could drive you myself,
but I need to get to Dallow ASAP.

390
00:35:55,368 --> 00:35:56,528
Are you okay?

391
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:58,527
Yeah, I'm okay.

392
00:36:00,006 --> 00:36:02,065
No, he's not.
He needs to go to a hospital.

393
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:04,575
I'm gonna send an ambulance
with the vans.

394
00:36:04,744 --> 00:36:07,076
You're gonna get the best medical care
available.

395
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:11,274
- Thank you.
- No, I should be thanking you.

396
00:36:11,984 --> 00:36:16,216
Okay, because of what you've done,
lives are gonna be changed forever.

397
00:36:32,438 --> 00:36:33,905
All right.

398
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,077
Listen, I need a ambulance
to come with the convoy.

399
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:55,350
Sir, what are your orders?

400
00:36:57,496 --> 00:36:58,963
Sir?

401
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:02,827
I don't know.

402
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:19,918
None of us will ever have to look
over our shoulders again.

403
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:23,044
That's the most important thing.

404
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:26,489
No matter what comes next.

405
00:37:26,892 --> 00:37:28,792
You're gonna make it, Michael.

406
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:32,397
You'll have the operation,
and then you'll get through this.

407
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:35,261
Just like we've gotten through
everything else.

408
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:40,466
She's worried about you.

409
00:38:02,027 --> 00:38:06,088
It's nice to know that the next time
I wanna drink one of these...

410
00:38:06,265 --> 00:38:08,699
...I won't have to drink it
in this crappy warehouse.

411
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:11,568
Yeah.

412
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:21,278
I can't even remember
being able to sit down at a restaurant...

413
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:23,438
...or go to a ball game.

414
00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:27,214
God, it seems like
I've been running forever.

415
00:38:27,386 --> 00:38:29,445
It's time to stand still...

416
00:38:29,622 --> 00:38:31,283
...take in the sun.

417
00:38:39,498 --> 00:38:40,988
Hey.

418
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:47,237
I know I'm supposed to be happy
right now.

419
00:38:47,606 --> 00:38:48,903
I'm so scared.

420
00:38:52,011 --> 00:38:56,072
I'm just scared we're gonna have come
all this way and I'm gonna lose you anyway.

421
00:38:57,049 --> 00:38:58,641
Come here.

422
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:01,185
Come on.

423
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:03,278
Sara.

424
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:07,119
Just don't tell me
that everything's gonna be okay, please.

425
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:10,085
Okay.

426
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:13,456
I won't.

427
00:39:34,153 --> 00:39:36,053
I see you brought your friend along.

428
00:39:36,222 --> 00:39:38,850
- What happened to Gretchen?
- She got away.

429
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:42,985
So here it is.

430
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,529
Oh, my God.

431
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:53,970
Wow, I can't believe it. So, what's next?

432
00:39:54,406 --> 00:39:57,603
- Senator Dallow?
- No, I need to tie up some loose ends.

433
00:39:57,843 --> 00:40:01,643
Did Gretchen and Bagwell say anything else
about Scylla, in terms of other buyers?

434
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:03,645
- Feng.
- He's dead.

435
00:40:04,116 --> 00:40:06,380
They didn't talk to anyone else?

436
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:09,020
We need as many indictments on this thing
as possible.

437
00:40:09,188 --> 00:40:10,519
Well, Bagwell might know.

438
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:15,322
Once we get him in interview room, offer
him a deal, his mouth will start moving.

439
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:36,438
Remember what I said to you
the first day we got here?

440
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,581
Yeah, you said that when this was over,
we were gonna settle up.

441
00:40:43,188 --> 00:40:44,314
We're settled.

442
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,226
Michael?

443
00:40:49,395 --> 00:40:53,354
It's been an hour. Would you call Self
and check on that ambulance?

444
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:06,938
Is he not picking up?

445
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:11,214
Maybe something's wrong
with the signal.

446
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:15,053
<i>The number you have reached
is not in service at this time.</i>

447
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,745
<i>And there is no new number.</i>

448
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,683
What is it?

449
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:34,764
You did really good on this one, Miriam.

450
00:41:35,808 --> 00:41:37,901
You really held your own.

451
00:41:39,011 --> 00:41:40,069
Thank you.

452
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:44,242
Can I take a closer look at that?

453
00:41:51,857 --> 00:41:54,724
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

454
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:55,553
Self.

455
00:42:56,689 --> 00:42:58,554
Self.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
