1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,720
Previously on prison break:

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,810
It was a meeting between all six cardholders.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,350
Now we know who has the other five cards.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,210
Your nose is bleeding.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,010
I'm cole pfeiffer.

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,590
Welcome to los angeles.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,290
His name is theodore bagwell.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,140
He was with us in panama and now he's here in los angeles.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,660
And he has a book that used to belong to whistler

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,540
and mahone thinks this book has a plan for the break-in.

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,670
Cole pfeiffer did not arrive for our meeting.

12
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,030
You don't have scylla?

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,380
It seems your friend whistler wasn't the only one looking into scyllA.

14
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,570
You know anything about that?

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,010
No.

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,900
I'm looking for the man who killed my son.

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,780
This man is a professional assassiN.

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,940
He's african american,six-foot,four,about 220 pounds.

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,000
We refined the image the best we could,

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,190
but we're going to need one of your specialists to sharpen the video so we can I.D.The rest of them.

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,920
All right,I'll see what I can do.

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,010
But I've seen what those tech guys are capable of.

23
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,090
Sometimes,it'S...

24
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,850
wait a sec,I know this guy.

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,920
This guy works in my building.That's griffin oren.

26
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,060
You know him?

27
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,680
I know of him.He's the head of treasury's L.A.Bureau.

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,060
Well,if he's in your building you can get close to him.

29
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,120
- I would need a reason.- Well,you make something up.

30
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,700
Something about al qaeda using stolen bearer bonds to finance shady operations,whatever.

31
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,060
Come on,making false claims in matters affecting government?

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,130
That's up to five years in prison.

33
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,530
Welcome to the club,agent self.

34
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,070
thanks for meeting me.I would have come out to see you,but I can't travel that far...

35
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,820
I'm sorry...

36
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,060
but you said that you had some pictures to show me.

37
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,510
that's him.

38
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,250
I'll get in touch with you as soon as...

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,680
as soon as...

40
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,980
I find out.

41
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,730
You didn't do this.

42
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,770
In your heart,you are a really good man.

43
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,700
That's why I married you.

44
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,620
That's why I started a family with you.

45
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,270
remember when you used to bring your files home

46
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,630
and I would beg you to leave that stuff at work?

47
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,470
But when you have a monster in your sights...

48
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,450
you can't focus until you get him.

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,020
I used to hate that about you.

50
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,540
Right now it's the only thing that lets me sleep,because I know...

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,920
you're going to get him.

52

55
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,910
What are you doing?

56
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,880
Hey there,blauney.

57
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,370
Just,uh...

58
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,880
doing a little research.

59
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,140
Gate-related?

60
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,120
I'm adding a little flourish to my pitch.

61
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,750
"Like the caged macaw who cannot spread her wings."

62
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,350
You know,cole...

63
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,120
I was thinking maybe you should spend a little less time practicing

64
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,680
and a little more time actually pitching.

65
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,200
I mean,number one salesman in the world?

66
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,320
We're all just waiting with bated breath to see what you can do around here.

67
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,530
I know.We saw him right here.

68
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,090
You haven't seen sara,have you?

69
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,590
No.

70
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,400
You want to end up back in fox river,you just go right ahead.

71
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,350
hey,what's going on?

72
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,570
He wants to look for t-bag.

73
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,640
You're damn right I want to look for him.We know he's got the bird book.

74
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,860
We know the bird book's got the plan for the break-in.

75
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,500
And we saw that snake right here today.

76
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,360
All I'm saying is,

77
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,650
it ain't safe for a member of the fox river eight to be out there

78
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,860
looking for another member of the fox river eight.

79
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,070
Yes,but...

80
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,800
bellick,I want you to go with sucre,canvass the area,see if you can get a lead on him.

81
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,410
There are like six big buildings over there.

82
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,710
He could be in any one of them.

83
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,760
That's why it's called canvassing.

84
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,480
You do realize this is the treasury department,right?

85
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,330
You tell self to go down a few floors,walk past the right computers and we are billionaires.

86
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,810
Just the card,please.

87
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,960
Don self,homeland security.

88
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,160
I need to see mr. Oren right away.

89
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,870
- He's not available.- Ma'am,I need to see him right away,

90
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,140
otherwise hundreds of american lives will be in jeopardy.

91
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,540
Don self,homeland security.

92
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,220
Talk to angela down the hall.

93
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,360
Sir,I'm sorry to barge in here,but this is urgent.

94
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,460
I'm sure it is.

95
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,980
Talk to angela down the hall.

96
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,260
Sir,we are hearing chatter about some stolen bearer bonds,

97
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,270
and we have reason to believe that al qaeda operatives...

98
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,020
you have serial numbers?

99
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,060
No,I do not.

100
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,830
Mind turning around?

101
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,630
Not at all.

102
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,420
I leave for asia in six hours.

103
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,590
He's got it.

104
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,180
Until then...

105
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,880
I've got meetings with the bureau chiefs of the fbi,the cia and homeland security.

106
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,930
It's gone.

107
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,700
If what you tell me is actually important,I'll hear about it from your boss.

108
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,360
Until then...

109
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,840
talk to angela down the hall.

110
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,950
And if you set foot in my office again without my prior consent,

111
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,690
I will see to it that you spend the rest of our career running border security in alaska.

112
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,420
Did we get it?

113
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,310
What happened?

114
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,380
What do you mean what happened?

115
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,490
We had it for two seconds and then it disappeared.

116
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,610
It's in the safe.

117
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,450
He has this crazy safe in his office.

118
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,250
That must have been blocking the transmission.

119
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,760
I'll bet you that's where he keeps the card.

120
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,150
So we need to get into that safe.

121
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,040
Trust me,there's no way to crack that thing.

122
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,040
Look,I'll have the enhanced images of the other cardholders in a couple of hours--

123
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,180
we'll go from there.

124
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,370
You can access the building's blueprints,right?

125
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,800
I can't go back up there.

126
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,820
No one's asking you.We'll take care of that.

127
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,600
Come on,you'll never get past the front door,okay?

128
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,250
Even if they don't recognize you,you need a security card that matches...

129
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,140
get the blueprints and get back here,all right?

130
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,830
yeah...

131
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,460
sara,what happened?

132
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,200
I'm fine,but someone was following me.

133
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,620
I lost him about a mile back.

134
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,780
I don't think there's any way he could have followed me here.I made sure of that.

135
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,320
What'd he look like?

136
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,230
Uh,tall,black.He had a beard.

137
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,230
This the guy?

138
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,470
Yeah.

139
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,860
Who's that?

140
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,550
That's the man who killed my son.

141
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,610
Now he's come to kill us.

142
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,730
Where were you the first time that you saw him?

143
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,630
The very first time?

144
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,890
Walking home.

145
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,030
He didn't just run into you on the street?

146
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,210
Where were you before that?

147
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,280
The towne lounge.

148
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,970
Is that a bar?

149
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,030
Do you have a problem with that?

150
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,060
No,I just want to know how long you were there.

151
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,140
Sara,I need to find this guy and i can't do it without your help.

152
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,410
I don't care why or what you were doing in the bar.

153
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,050
I just really want to know how long you were there.

154
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,180
Okay.A couple hours.

155
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,760
So something must have tipped him off.

156
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,720
You paid cash,right?

157
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,460
Of course.

158
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,670
But the credit card that bruce gave me is gone.

159
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,630
What credit card?

160
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,410
These are the security checkpoints.

161
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,970
You can't get past one of those unless you have one of these.

162
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,520
Any way we can forge it?

163
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,680
Sure,if you have two weeks and access to the building's mainframe maybe.

164
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,060
Well,doesn't look like there are any security checkpoints on the tenth floor.

165
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,730
No,just that all the access points to the tenth floor.

166
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,800
But if you could somehow magically appear and wind up in the middle of the hallway,

167
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,920
you'd be fine,except for all the government officials who'd be swarming around

168
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,540
and who would arrest you in a heartbeat.

169
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,610
And if you can get us into the parking structure,will security check our van?

170
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,430
Sure.Transporting known felons,why not?

171
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,960
So,the parking garage.

172
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,280
This is our point of entry.

173
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,360
We need the details to the safe.

174
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:06,160
Okay,the,um,the safe has an insignia on it.

175
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,150
It looks something like this.

176
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,550
You're gonna need some of this.

177
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,630
I got a positive id of sara tancredi in los angeles.

178
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
That means michael scofield was here.

179
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,080
That means lincoln burrows is here.

180
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,460
Why?

181
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,490
Sara,huh?

182
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,050
She's a slippery little bitch,isn't she?

183
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,370
time is not on your side,gretchen.

184
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:09,070
Maybe you hadn't noticed,but since you seem to be somewhat immune to physical coercion,

185
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,800
we've decided to move on.

186
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,660
The nose is an evolutionary marvel.

187
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,370
Our brain has been constructed so that certain aromas...

188
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,400
coffee beans,blueberries that are helpful to our body,we perceive as pleasant.

189
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,920
Whereas other smells that signify death,disease.

190
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,630
Initial symptoms include nausea,dizziness,burning eyes,

191
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,590
all of which you are experiencing right now.

192
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:52,880
Prolonged exposure will lead to faintness,rapid degradation of your mental faculties.

193
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,670
Tell me.

194
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,450
I don't know anything.

195
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,090
You've got one more day.

196
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,490
top of the line.

197
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,830
It's a biometric design,and only oren's fingerprint will open it.

198
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,300
So we lift his prints off something he touched.

199
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,250
The pad knows what human skin feels like.

200
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,470
If we try to trick it,we'll set off the alarm.

201
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,640
And then there's the 12-digit key code.

202
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,760
What about the hinges?

203
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,720
- Wired to the alarm.- We drill it.

204
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,300
Through the outer layer of steel maybe,

205
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,290
but the bones of this thing are three-quarters inch of cobalt alloy hard plate.

206
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,450
Drilling's not gonna work,not in our timeframe.

207
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,200
All right,so basically,we have a way to get you into the garage,

208
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,850
which,in case you guys forgot,that puts me on the hook for another four charges.

209
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,940
But no way to get you up to the tenth floor.

210
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,040
But let's say you do get up to the tenth floor.

211
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,430
Then we need to get you into oren's office for an hour during the middle of the day.

212
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,190
Then,we need to hope that not one of oren's co-workers is gonna hear the extremely loud drill

213
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:12,180
that you're gonna be using to break into a safe that I'm telling you cannot be broken into.

214
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,010
Do you understand there are homeland agents

215
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,510
whose sole job is to design safety measures to make this structure impregnable.

216
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,850
Yeah.

217
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,350
They had those guys fox river,too.

218
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,830
Whose office is this?

219
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,180
Sam middleton,department of justice.

220
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,240
This wall separates middleton from warren.

221
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,540
I'm gonna need some supplies.

222
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,900
The credit card was used at the bar at 10:32.

223
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,260
What time did you see him?

224
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,520
About 11:00.

225
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,800
And how long were you walking at that time?

226
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,230
Ten,15 minutes.

227
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,700
Let's assume that he was at his place when we received the call.

228
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,240
That's an 18-minute drive from the towne lounge bar in san pedro.

229
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,830
Averaging 30 miles an hour the whole way,that's a,that's a nine-mile radius.

230
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,180
So he's gonna be somewhere around the perimeter of that circle.

231
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,190
He's got to be mobile within a half mile of a major freeway.

232
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,380
The 10,the 110,the 405.

233
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,740
No permanent address,so we're looking for hotels,right?

234
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,360
Yeah,but nowhere where you need to valet your car.

235
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,810
It's got to be readily accessible at all times.

236
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,410
And somewhere you don't need to put a credit card down for incidentals.

237
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,170
- You got that?- I'll see what I can do.

238
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,930
Hurry.

239
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,060
Trishanne,I'm gonna need a mug of tea with lemon.

240
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
I'm sorry,cole.

241
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,330
I can't leave the desk right now.

242
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,790
Good help is so hard to find.

243
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,680
Trishanne: May I help you?

244
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,430
We're with upper valley insurance.

245
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,320
And this man just came into a $100,000 inheritance.

246
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,640
We can't track him down,

247
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,940
so we're offering a ten percent finder's fee to anyone who can point us in his direction.

248
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,220
Oh,my gosh.What,$10,000?

249
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,980
Yeah.

250
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,470
I'm sorry.

251
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,330
I don't recognize him.

252
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,900
Okay,so if you do see him,would you please give us a call?

253
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,980
Thank you.

254
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,990
"Gate"?

255
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,120
"Greatness achieved through excellence."

256
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,660
A toy?

257
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,200
You want to try to explain this?

258
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,380
Mix aluminum powder with iron oxide.

259
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,820
Add a little heat.

260
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,370
Yeah,well,thanks for calling me back,sam.

261
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,720
yeah.No,I just,I know you have these trial dates coming up

262
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,570
and we just want to make sure you have everything you need to convict these bastards.

263
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,540
Okay,that's terrific.

264
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,070
All right,I'll see you then.

265
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,510
All right,we're gonna have lunch.

266
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,920
I'll keep him out of his office for as long as I can.

267
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,660
Good luck.

268
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,200
All right.

269
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,360
- hello.- Hey,any sign of him?

270
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,760
No,we checked about ten buildings,but nothing so far.

271
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,120
Well,scrap it; we're going after the next card.

272
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,140
Meet me on the corner of santa monica and century west.

273
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,100
hey,charlie.

274
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,840
Yankees lost again last night.

275
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,930
Yeah,well,at least our fans show up before the fifth inning,right?

276
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,200
Have a good day,all right,charlie?

277
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,250
You,too,mr. Self.

278
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,880
I'm letting you guys know right now.

279
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,980
If you get caught,don't mention my name.

280
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,630
We're ready.

281
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,540
Now.

282
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,330
One,two,three.

283
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,540
So...

284
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,320
a couple of scruffy guys walk in,

285
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,220
tell me they're from the insurance company

286
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,120
and they offer me $10,000 if I know where you are.

287
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,530
Something tells me there's a better offer on the table.

288
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,620
Well,I'll be,trishanne.

289
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,880
You just caught yourself a leprechaun.

290
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:50,310
And as the legend goes,you got yourself one wish,anything in the world.

291
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,870
- Oh,really?- And I am bound to grant it.

292
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,420
Yeah?

293
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,340
Well,your commencement check's sitting on my desk waiting to be signed.

294
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,660
That's a pretty nice pot of gold.

295
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,960
Before you say another word...

296
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,660
now,it's true leprechauns cannot refuse their captor's demands,

297
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,830
but if they deem her to be greedy or covetous,

298
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:20,070
whatever she desires will certainly be accompanied with disastrous tidings.

299
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,340
Or so the legend goes.

300
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,560
Three percent of your commission from here on out.

301
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,540
Done.

302
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,620
Don self to see you.

303
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,690
You can go right on in.

304
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,090
Thank you.Have a great day.

305
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,910
Hey,hey.

306
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,680
Hey,sam.

307
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,720
Great to meet you.

308
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,500
Same here.

309
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,910
Oh,thanks again for squeezing me in on such short notice.

310
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,830
I figure we had so much to get through,this'd be the best way.

311
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,290
I-I thought we were going out for lunch.

312
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,080
Is there a problem?

313
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,570
Well...

314
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,610
actually,um...

315
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,170
I'm a vegetarian.

316
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:16,120
It's a new diet,b-b-but there's a great place down the street,and it'll be my treat.

317
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,610
- Elise.
- Yes,sir?

318
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,470
I'm heading out for lunch.

319
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,920
Hold it there.

320
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,740
Sorry,I was just coming in to...

321
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,960
there's no more tp in the ladies room.

322
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,490
We'll get right on that.

323
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,480
How about you get it right now?

324
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,410
best we got in here.

325
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,950
You guys need to get better organized.

326
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:49,300
53 hotels match the search criteria.

327
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,310
You know I read,I read this article a little while ago,right?

328
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,030
About the whole,uh,nature versus nurture thing,and it turns out,

329
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,810
it's all kind of a mishmash because dna trumps everything.

330
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:09,770
And I believe it,because I mean,I grew up in the same house,

331
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,020
uh,went to the same school as my brother,who's a math professor,my sister's a pediatrician.

332
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,080
And I'm a thief who blows his money on hookers and coke.

333
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,150
So,like the same way scofield's hardwired to be a genius,

334
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,610
and you are always gonna be a lawman,right?

335
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,820
I mean,whoever this guy is,you think he wanted to grow up to be a murderer?Probably not.

336
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:35,100
Be very careful choosing the next words that come out of your mouth.

337
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,020
I...

338
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,010
I'm just saying.

339
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,100
We are who we are.

340
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,280
Oh,man.

341
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,430
jake.I'm gonna need you in front of room 1018.NOW.

342
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,290
What's going on?

343
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,810
I apologize,ma'am,but we're gonna be in your way for the next 90 minutes or so.

344
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:11,970
Black?

345
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,270
Yeah.

346
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,510
Excuse me,ma'am,but where can I plug in?

347
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,470
For now,you can go in there,but when my boss gets back from lunch,you're gonna...

348
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,300
the safe should be somewhere behind this wall.

349
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,430
as soon as you're through the steel,I'll have the thermite ready.

350
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,470
what is it?

351
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,300
How long has it been happening?

352
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,260
It's not a big deal.

353
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,860
It was a big deal when you were 13.

354
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,250
Just promise me you won't tell sara.

355
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,200
Sara's a doctor.

356
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,070
She can help.

357
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,730
Look,I acclimating to the warmer climate,all right?

358
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,440
Come on.

359
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,770
We've got work to do.

360
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,570
Let's go.

361
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,230
I don't know what this company is up to,

362
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,650
but it sure sounds like there's a whole lot of money involved.

363
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,640
I don't know.

364
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,210
Lisa tabak just hopped a flight to laos,didn't she?

365
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,190
Yeah,I guess.

366
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,490
And now griffin oren just said he was going somewhere in asia.

367
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,660
Down to the cobalt.

368
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,290
Right.

369
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,780
what can I get you?

370
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,170
Just a moment of your time.

371
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,590
I'm a private investigator,and I'm working with a woman named sara tancredi,

372
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,880
and she was recently a patron of yours.

373
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,940
I don't want to get involved.

374
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,630
She moved all the way across the country to get away from this guy.

375
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,970
Help me find him before he finds her.

376
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,720
Last time,sara had a broken jaw.

377
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,480
I was standing by the front door when he left.

378
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,480
A second later I saw him come past,take something out of his car.

379
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,900
Do you remember what the car looked like?

380
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,910
Gray.

381
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,940
A sedan,sort of like one of those rental cars,you know?

382
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,610
You need something?

383
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,230
Just a small...

384
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,580
kindness.

385
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,980
That's the easiest $300 you'll ever make.

386
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,050
We're working here.

387
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,000
so am I.

388
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,330
There's a stack of letters that I need to put in the mail.

389
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,060
The chemicals,they don't react so good with leather.

390
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,230
What are you using,lye?

391
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,050
Wait,wait,wait.

392
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,850
Listen,we...

393
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,140
we know this is a hassle.

394
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,040
We know we're disrupting your work and giving you a headache.

395
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,200
We annoy a different person every day,but if this gets dirty while it's still wet,

396
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,650
it's gonna leave a stain,and...

397
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,550
and,uh,and then we'll be back here all over again.

398
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,460
Why don't you just tell me where they are and I'll get them for you?

399
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:52,600
On the corner of his desk near his computer.

400
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,950
How much longer?

401
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:00,680
Another couple of minutes,and we'll be ready to copy.

402
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,440
is griffin in?

403
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,870
He's in a meeting right now,but I can pull him out if you'd like.

404
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,220
If you could.

405
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,400
Just have a seat in his office.

406
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,320
He'll be right with you.

407
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,510
All we need is one more.

408
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,520
someone's in there.

409
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,670
If I could hear him sitting down,there's no way he's not gonna hear the drill.

410
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,800
You can do it manually.

411
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,510
Generate enough heat to activate the thermite?

412
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,440
Come on,man,we're like a 16th of an inch away from this.

413
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,200
can I help you?

414
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,720
I phoned earlier about one of your guests.

415
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,790
Gray sedan,right?

416
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,520
Yeah,right.

417
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,800
Is that the guy?

418
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,790
Yeah,that's him.

419
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,190
What room?

420
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,440
He was in 130.

421
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,110
He checked out.

422
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,700
Did,um...

423
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,920
did he leave any clue as to where he was going?

424
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,720
Do you mind if I look at the room?

425
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,370
$19 an hour,$59 for the night.

426
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,840
Fine,whatever,give me a key.

427
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,830
yes.

428
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,130
You wanted to know if anyone came looking for you.

429
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,740
Did they?

430
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,530
no.

431
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,910
I was just calling to let you know my shift was ending and nobody showed up.

432
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,680
All right.

433
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,420
Thank you.

434
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,640
What do you say you give me that little piece of paper in your hand?

435
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
How's that sound,huh?

436
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,870
Sorry for keeping you.

437
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,700
To what do I owe the pleasure?

438
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,910
Just making sure you're ready for your trip.

439
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,740
Well,I better be.

440
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,460
I'm leaving in five minutes.

441
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,140
all right,and if we dial it down to the lowest setting,that might work.

442
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:48,830
Sure?

443
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,020
We don't have a choice.

444
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,230
I'll tell you when.

445
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,290
The finance minister's anxiously awaiting your arrival.

446
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,650
Well,if you recall,I successfully negotiated financial policies with the imf and world bank.

447
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,060
Pretty sure I can handle laos.

448
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,400
Now.

449
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,420
I'm well aware of your resume,griffin.

450
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,420
Got it.

451
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,490
we're in.

452
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,270
Got it.

453
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:43,010
The runaway inflation in laos has given way to food riots in the capital city of vientiane,

454
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,750
where the death toll has risen over 200.

455
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,860
The monetary policy is a means to an end.

456
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,090
I'm aware of our final objective,general.

457
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,660
This is an important day for us.

458
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,660
I need to make sure that everyone knows his role.

459
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,530
You could've told me all of this on the telephone.

460
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,690
Why did you take today of all days to come down here and berate me in person?

461
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,060
Things have happened in the past few days that have made me somewhat uneasy.

462
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,710
Today we got confirmation that one of our targets is in los angeles.

463
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:39,120
That on top of the fact,that one of lisa's bodyguards was killed.

464
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,590
I thought that was because she was married to that turk.

465
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,510
That's the official story.

466
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,900
What is it then?

467
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,890
Come on,come on.

468
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,830
Do you have your card on you,griffin?

469
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,670
Of course.

470
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,400
I'd like to see it.

471
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,130
Where are we?

472
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,250
Talk to me roland.

473
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,850
72%.

474
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,330
I put it in my safe this morning.

475
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,950
I'd like to see it.

476
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,530
86.

477
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,990
15 years working together,you think you'd trust me.

478
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,960
Don't turn this into an opera.

479
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,160
Just hand me the card.

480
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,110
Come o come on.

481
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,370
Happy?

482
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,520
From now on,I'm asking that everyone keep their card on them at all times.

483
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,060
Anyone makes a move,anything goes missing,you call me.

484
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
Did weet it?

485
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,830
Yeah.

486
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,230
I don't know how you eat that crap,don.

487
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:29,980
What was that called?

488
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,580
Tempeh?

489
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,280
Yeah.

490
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,730
It looked like you could barely choke it down.

491
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,070
Yeah,well,it's an acquired taste.

492
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,570
Excuse us.

493
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,600
All right,ell,it looks like I should be getting back to work.

494
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,730
This was a pleasure.

495
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,040
apparently,billions in counterfeit currency flooded the economy,

496
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,010
which is what caused it all.

497
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,250
What I don't understand is why?

498
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,270
I mean,so far all the cardholders have been experts in their fields,right?

499
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,460
In-in energy,and logistics,and finance.

500
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,720
I mean,it looks like they're trying to tear the country down.

501
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,740
And then they profit by rebuilding it.

502
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:27,800
So the question is: What's next?

503
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,940
I was at a bar earlier.

504
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,060
And nothing happened,and I didn't drink.

505
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,210
look,if-if this is too much...For you...

506
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:39,850
No.

507
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,150
because,say the word,and we'll scrap the whole thing.

508
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,950
- That's a promise.
- It's not going to happen again.

509
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,770
But it would be a lie not to tell you,and I...

510
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,930
want you to know that I'll never lie to you.

511
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,770
I'm sorry.

512
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,570
somebody's here for you.

513
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,260
For me?

514
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,970
Cole pfeiffer.

515
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,400
Is your name xing?

516
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,750
Mr. Xing stayed behind in new york.

517
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,290
Well,have a seat then,uh-- what can I help you with?

518
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,130
You were supposed to deliver the item two days ago.

519
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:44,830
Where is it?

520
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,840
Where's what?

521
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,920
I've traveled a long way,mr. Pfeiffer.

522
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,890
My patience is wearing thin.

523
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,050
Playing games is not going to be good for either of us.

524
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,720
Scylla.

525
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,410
Where is it?

526
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,690
- Mr. Pfeiffer?
- I'm at work.

527
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,880
It's not exactly like I can talk freely,you know.

528
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,600
Just-just tell me the latest.

529
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,530
The latest?

530
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,460
If you deliver it to me by the end of the day,

531
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,520
I will pay you the sum that we agreed upon.

532
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,940
As much as I'd like to tell you that were possible...

533
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,630
get it to me by tomorrow and you will receive 50% of your fee.

534
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,190
Two days,25%.

535
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,120
Three days,I shoot you through the brain.

536
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,310
That is the latest.

537
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,070
No problem.

538
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,820
I thought that urine might be getting a little stale.

539
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,140
So I brought you some more.

540
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,210
hey,the image enhancement for the video came back.

541
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,270
Did you get what I sent over?

542
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,960
All three cardholders?

543
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,210
Yeah,well,for the first two,we have names,addresses--

544
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,610
everything we need to grab them.

545
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,590
Sara.

546
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,050
But for the general...

547
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,190
we got nothing.

548
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,180
This guy's a ghost.

549
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:17,160
You all right?

550
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,880
Look,most of what happened to me in panama is a total blank.

551
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,940
But,um,when I was being held,

552
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,130
I could hear gretchen talking on the phone,in the next room.

553
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,890
And she was taking orders from the guy in charge.

554
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,770
And she called him the general.

555
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,920
In charge of the mission?

556
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,570
No,I think in charge of the company.

557
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,370
I told you...

558
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:49,580
we should have killed gretchen when we had the chance.

559
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,400
She'll come home.

560
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,680
She always has.

561
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,090
You better be sure about that.

562
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,790
Excuse me,sir?

563
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,560
What?

564
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,590
Someone at homeland security did an enhanced image search on you today.

565
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,100
We couldn't tell where the original picture...

566
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,640
who?

567
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,850
The guy who ordered it...

568
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,870
his name is don self.

569
