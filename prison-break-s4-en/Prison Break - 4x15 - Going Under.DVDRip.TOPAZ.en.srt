1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,047
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:13,217
Michael!

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:17,455
Scylla is complete.

4
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:21,000
- What the hell are you doing?
- Buyer's already on the way.

5
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:25,831
Yeah, I got one. It's Bagwell.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,237
There is no meeting
with the attorney general, is there?

7
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:32,275
He's sick, Lincoln.
If they haven't killed him already.

8
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:33,980
We'll get him back. I promise.

9
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:35,581
Michael needs an operation...

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,980
...to remove a tumor
from his temporal lobe.

11
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:40,711
And the price
is the safe return of Scylla.

12
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:43,686
- What's this?
- Added incentive.

13
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:52,196
What's going on? Where's Michael?

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,368
Michael needs surgery.
He's gonna get it.

15
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:56,503
- Where?
- Here.

16
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:59,072
What?

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,867
Krantz has arranged for doctors.

18
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:02,542
We can't let them near him.

19
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:05,235
Out of time. It's our last option.

20
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:08,905
I don't understand
why the Company would help him.

21
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,948
Dr. Tancredi. Welcome.

22
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:14,752
Please.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

23
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,518
- All we want is to help.
- You're gonna save Michael?

24
00:01:18,726 --> 00:01:20,318
You question our capabilities?

25
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,324
No, I'm questioning your motives.

26
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:27,933
When a fellow human being is suffering,
why would we not want to lend a hand?

27
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:29,797
Empathy, Sara.

28
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:33,098
It's the only thing
that separates us from the beasts.

29
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:38,136
For the duration of the surgery,
you'll be treated as a guest in my home.

30
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:40,641
And afterwards?

31
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:43,613
Sir, the patient is ready.

32
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:47,914
It's gonna be all right, Sara.

33
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:49,351
Trust me.

34
00:01:57,665 --> 00:02:00,998
Mr. Scofield, although you're
going to be anesthetized...

35
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:03,694
...and should feel no significant pain...

36
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:07,204
...we will need to keep you awake
for the duration of the procedure.

37
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:08,636
As a safety precaution...

38
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,008
...we'll need to continually monitor
your speech and sensory activity...

39
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:17,880
...to insure the tissue being removed
will not leave you impaired in any way.

40
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,848
What hospital is this?

41
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:21,379
Don't worry about it.

42
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:24,956
You've got some good doctors
who are gonna take great care of you.

43
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:28,022
I have to get Scylla.

44
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:29,891
No, no, no.

45
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:31,860
Not now.

46
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,858
- Where's Linc?
- He's here.

47
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:37,333
And he's just fine.

48
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,030
I'm not leaving
until Michael has surgery.

49
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:44,201
I'm not starting surgery until you prove
you can hold up your end of the deal.

50
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:47,806
Scylla's slipping through our fingers
as we speak.

51
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:52,379
Time is not on our side
nor on your brother's.

52
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:55,522
Now, you'll get full cooperation
from my office.

53
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:57,884
You need anything,
just call this number.

54
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:00,687
I'm gonna need everything you got
on Self and Gretchen.

55
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:02,988
Aliases. Whatever you got.

56
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:06,428
How about an accomplice?

57
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,270
- Now, if you're gonna want...
- Shut up.

58
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:20,607
You'll save yourself pain
and embarrassment...

59
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:22,943
...if you just tell me where they are.

60
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:26,085
- Gretchen and Agent Turncoat?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:27,585
Information like that...

62
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:30,417
...seems like it could be
of certain intrinsic value.

63
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:33,617
If there were offers made,
carrots dangled...

64
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:35,353
...I could see my...

65
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:39,860
I deserve some kind of something here.
All the work I put in.

66
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:43,400
If it wasn't for me finding Whistler's
bird book then where would...

67
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:49,571
The only thing you deserve
is the opportunity to keep your teeth...

68
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:51,735
...and your fingernails.
- Lf you do this...

69
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:53,938
...l'm not gonna tell you any...

70
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:57,676
I'm gonna pull out every single tooth,
every single one.

71
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:59,943
How about it?

72
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:01,951
Look, I was just fooling...

73
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,589
- Tell me!
- Arlington Pier.

74
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:05,623
Arlington... Arlington Pier.

75
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:08,091
When? What time?

76
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:10,461
Three o'clock.

77
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:16,497
This is the last of the anesthetic.

78
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:18,932
From here on out,
you shouldn't feel a thing.

79
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,438
I'm gonna be right over there
the whole time.

80
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,610
I'll be right in here the whole time.

81
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,776
We're ready.

82
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:34,512
I'm not gonna leave you, okay?

83
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:35,984
Don't you dare leave me.

84
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:57,608
- EEG is calibrated.
- Have the instruments?

85
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:01,508
How many surgeries
has your team performed...

86
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,172
...using the gamma knife?

87
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:06,787
The gamma knife has a recurrence rate
of over 13 percent.

88
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:10,117
We'll be using a technique
that's more advanced.

89
00:05:57,004 --> 00:05:58,938
- What's going on?
- They're gonna operate.

90
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:00,801
Just like that? They agreed to?

91
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:03,602
I convinced them Michael knew
who was gonna buy Scylla.

92
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:06,075
- What are we gonna do now?
- Get our hands on it.

93
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,340
- And give it to who?
- Still working on that.

94
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:10,381
- I need to know why.
- To finish this!

95
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:13,384
Really?
Because it feels like it's finishing us.

96
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:16,952
You, me, we're the only ones left, bro.

97
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:20,959
One more day and we're done.
I can't do this without you.

98
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:41,745
When the buyer gets here,
let me do the talking.

99
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,042
For what?

100
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:46,152
I engineered this whole thing.
I can handle my business.

101
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:47,581
Oh, yeah?

102
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:51,816
Start by handling that river of nerves
that's running down your forehead.

103
00:06:51,993 --> 00:06:54,587
- Did you think this would be easier?
- I hoped.

104
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:57,730
I guess I knew it was gonna come down
to a pile of bodies.

105
00:06:57,932 --> 00:07:01,629
- I never pegged you for a killer.
- Yeah, I never pegged you for a mom.

106
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:08,174
Is there anything
that you'd like to peg me for, Don?

107
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:10,434
Oh, stop, okay?

108
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:13,239
Don't embarrass yourself.
It may work on everyone else.

109
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:16,315
But the only thing I'm thinking about
is that 125 million.

110
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:20,078
So close up your blouse, open your eyes,
because the buyer's on the way.

111
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:23,279
I don't want any surprises
when he gets here.

112
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,161
- How much longer?
- Another hour or so.

113
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:37,429
Just sit tight.

114
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:39,004
I need to use the men's room.

115
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:41,538
- Congratulations.
- Do you think I'm gonna run?

116
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:44,802
- That's exactly what I think.
- You want me to go right here?

117
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:47,207
Have respect for my intelligence,
Alex.

118
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:51,384
I do, which is why I know
you wouldn't violate Code 42-13-72B...

119
00:07:51,552 --> 00:07:55,488
...which states that an individual being
transported by the justice system...

120
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,454
...must be afforded
the opportunity to relieve himself...

121
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:01,823
...if the duration of the transport
is more than three hours.

122
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:04,226
I do believe we're creeping up
on that time.

123
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,696
All right, I'll see what I can do.

124
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:09,495
But I'm gonna remind you of a code.
The one that says:

125
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,195
"If a prisoner attempts escape
during transfer...

126
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:14,364
...the accompanying agent
has the right...

127
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:16,806
...to shoot him
through the back of the head."

128
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:20,238
You sure you don't wanna hold it,
Alex?

129
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:23,380
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

130
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,324
Any pain or discomfort, Mr. Scofield?

131
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:33,015
No.

132
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:36,663
Those needles,
they're for stabilization?

133
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,525
Not exactly.

134
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:40,257
Throughout the surgery...

135
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:43,437
...portions of Michael's cerebral cortex
will be stimulated...

136
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:47,700
...triggering the areas that control senses
like hearing, smell, memory.

137
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,208
That's why some people,
right before death often speak of...

138
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:54,575
- Their life flashing before their eyes.
- Exactly.

139
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:58,210
When oxygen is cut off to the brain,
it kicks into overdrive...

140
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:02,515
...tapping into every resource
to continue operating the body.

141
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,022
As a result,
all of the senses fire off at once.

142
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:09,891
Everything you've ever known,
felt, believed...

143
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:12,993
...it all passes in a blink of an eye.

144
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,335
Hello, Michael.

145
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:02,140
Charles.

146
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,047
I guess
you could probably call me D.B. Now.

147
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:15,787
The answer is no.

148
00:10:15,996 --> 00:10:17,156
The answer?

149
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:19,195
You're wondering if you're dead.

150
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,957
The answer is no.

151
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:24,193
Then why am I here?

152
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:30,208
I believe that's a question
we all need to find the answer to.

153
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:42,219
This is now the most secure bathroom
break in the history of law enforcement.

154
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:43,947
Yes, it is.

155
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:46,354
If you wanna cuff me
and block off the exits...

156
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:49,155
...take it out and give it a tap
if it makes you happy.

157
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,230
Would that make you feel happy,
Alex?

158
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:52,888
I hear prison can change a man.

159
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,534
Could we just get this over with?

160
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,510
- All clear.
- You have 15 seconds.

161
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:35,407
Wasn't so bad now, was it?

162
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:43,380
You should've trusted me,
like I trusted you.

163
00:11:57,398 --> 00:11:58,729
All right.

164
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,927
We're ready to begin
to isolate the tumor now, Mr. Scofield.

165
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,865
As we talked about...

166
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:08,269
...l'm gonna ask you
to slowly recite the alphabet.

167
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:10,535
If you have any problems
finding a letter...

168
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:15,307
...any problems saying a letter,
you let us know, all right?

169
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:17,313
All right.

170
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:26,259
Okay.

171
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:28,122
Ready?

172
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,129
And begin.

173
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:32,060
A.

174
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:33,824
B.

175
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:36,767
C.

176
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:38,765
D.

177
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:40,065
E.

178
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:42,299
F.

179
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:43,704
G.

180
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:47,113
H, I.

181
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:49,942
- I'm sorry, Charles.
- For what?

182
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:51,709
For everything.

183
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,251
For all the lies I told.

184
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,418
For all the pain I caused.

185
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:59,251
Are you asking for forgiveness?

186
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,655
I'm not sure I'm entitled to it.

187
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:10,334
I guess that's for a power
higher than us to decide, isn't it?

188
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:16,870
It's just hard...

189
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:19,535
Hard to believe we've lost.

190
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:23,210
That it was all for nothing.

191
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:25,682
It doesn't have to be.

192
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:46,666
It looks like the tumor's nestled
behind the hippocampus.

193
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:51,006
<i>You have the answers, Michael.</i>

194
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:53,145
What are the questions?

195
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:55,242
I don't know.

196
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,077
But you do.

197
00:13:57,317 --> 00:13:59,512
You just haven't realized it yet.

198
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:12,557
Up here, make a right.
No, no, left, left, left.

199
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:16,226
We got 10 minutes.

200
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:18,997
- What do you think?
- It's gonna be tight.

201
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:23,674
All right, any minute now.

202
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:25,709
There's no sign of them.

203
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,506
Check Vikan's PDA.

204
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:31,117
- See if the buyer left him a message.
- Oh, this thing is broken.

205
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:33,286
It must've cracked
when he hit the ground.

206
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:35,285
Can you still see the contact number?

207
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:38,516
- Yeah, a Miami area code.
- Read it out, I'll put it in mine.

208
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:40,192
I'm not reading out anything.

209
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,557
I'm gonna keep that number for now,
if you don't mind.

210
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:46,062
- Who is it?
- It's my sister.

211
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,860
Don't answer it.

212
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,467
I said don't answer it.

213
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:51,837
Shoot me.

214
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:55,568
Hello?

215
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:57,703
<i>We're free. He's gone.</i>

216
00:14:57,878 --> 00:15:01,314
- What?
- The guy with the fake hand.

217
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:02,779
He let us go.

218
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,477
So we ran to the Patels' house,
and later I looked out the window...

219
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:11,090
...and I saw these two guys in suits,
and they dragged him off into some van.

220
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:13,719
- Put Bagwell on the phone.
- He's not there.

221
00:15:13,894 --> 00:15:17,591
- Gretchen, I'm not playing anymore.
- Don, the Company took him.

222
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:24,369
How's Emily?

223
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,765
She's fine.

224
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:29,505
Listen, Gretchen.

225
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:33,674
<i>You need to stay away from us,
for everyone's sake.</i>

226
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:34,973
<i>Here, baby.</i>

227
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:37,072
Bye, auntie.

228
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,756
Forget that ape, Bagwell.

229
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:45,755
No, I can't.

230
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:48,326
He knows the location
of the exchange.

231
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:52,090
If he knows we're here,
then the Company does too.

232
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:05,842
Hey, that's it. Right there.
Arlington Pier. Pull over.

233
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:41,373
<i>Blood, papi.</i>

234
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:43,447
We just missed them.

235
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:46,678
I'll go look around.

236
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,017
<i>Operator.</i>

237
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:55,821
The general said to call this number
if I needed help.

238
00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:58,328
<i>- Your clearance code, please.
- Clearance code?</i>

239
00:16:58,498 --> 00:17:01,695
How about I'm Lincoln Burrows,
and you're about to lose Scylla.

240
00:17:02,402 --> 00:17:03,494
<i>Proceed.</i>

241
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:06,172
<i>- I need a trace on this line.
- We've already tried.</i>

242
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:09,365
<i>You're in a zone where
visual surveillance is an impossibility.</i>

243
00:17:09,543 --> 00:17:13,274
Look outside the zone and check for
a vehicle leaving in the last 15 minutes.

244
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:15,481
If you see one,
get a match and call me.

245
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:20,417
Nothing. No tracks. But I found these.

246
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:22,214
They know we're onto them.

247
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:25,050
We gotta find these people
before they split.

248
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:40,804
Someone's here,
but it's not the seller.

249
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:43,067
What do you want me to do?

250
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,548
I'm just curious, Lang.

251
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:57,481
When did you decide
to turn your back on me?

252
00:17:57,658 --> 00:18:00,092
About the same time
you decided to become a fugitive.

253
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,889
- I wasn't talking to you.
- I took an oath to uphold the law, Alex.

254
00:18:04,097 --> 00:18:06,463
Did you do it for a promotion?

255
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,624
They promise you anything
to serve me up?

256
00:18:08,802 --> 00:18:10,963
The only thing I ever wanted
was your safety.

257
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:16,433
The longer you're on the run, the lower
my chance of getting what I want.

258
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,480
What are you looking for
out there, Alex?

259
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:28,786
There.

260
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:41,634
This is Agent Wheeler
I've got a suspect fleeing custody...

261
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:46,432
...about three miles north of Greenburg.
Requesting back up and air support.

262
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:00,614
I didn't mean to startle you.

263
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:02,381
What are you doing here?

264
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:04,487
Customer service.

265
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:05,784
Quality control.

266
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:09,525
I like to keep a hand
in all our theaters of engagement.

267
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,721
Spoken like a military man.

268
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:15,527
It's so easy to discuss lives
in the balance when it's just theater.

269
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:18,068
I admire your devotion, Sara.

270
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:21,207
It's an attribute
I value above all others.

271
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:23,342
But I wonder.

272
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,173
Is it the cause you believe in
or the man?

273
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:30,874
I mean, are you an ideologue?

274
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:35,350
Or just a silly schoolgirl
following the brooding boy...

275
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:36,887
...who finally noticed her?

276
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:40,720
I'm the girl whose father was murdered,
looking for the bastard responsible.

277
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:43,425
Would you like me
to make a few phone calls?

278
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,622
See if I can point you
in the right direction?

279
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:48,493
You can relax.

280
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:51,728
- He's receiving the best possible care.
- Is he?

281
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:54,702
Because I've never seen this equipment,
this procedure.

282
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,206
It's experimental, isn't it?

283
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:59,777
Well, you could say that.
But it has been used once before.

284
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:01,675
How long did the patient live?

285
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:05,545
Dr. Tancredi, I know your opinion
of the work we do here...

286
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:09,849
...but know this,
not everything is as it seems.

287
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:16,224
And for what it's worth,
the patient lived a long and happy life.

288
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,408
What are you doing?

289
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:38,711
It's the job of a structural engineer
to make sure everything he creates...

290
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:42,878
...is designed to withstand
the weight placed upon it.

291
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:47,254
What I built here does not hold up.

292
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:51,923
If you discovered that a structure
you built is deficient...

293
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:57,501
...would you tear down the building,
or find a way to fix it?

294
00:20:57,737 --> 00:20:59,967
I've tried to fix it.

295
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:03,442
I've tried to make things right.

296
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:07,477
All I've done is add more weight to it.

297
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:10,140
And now...

298
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:15,246
Now it can't take any more.

299
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:20,856
All I wanted to do
was save my brother's life.

300
00:21:21,027 --> 00:21:22,619
Did you do that?

301
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,991
Yes.

302
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,033
But how many other people
have lost their lives in the process?

303
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:33,603
Knowing that now,
would you have let him die?

304
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:35,365
No.

305
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:39,537
And that makes you feel
like some kind of murderer?

306
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:44,275
Perhaps.

307
00:21:45,886 --> 00:21:47,786
Take 10 lives, you're a serial killer.

308
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:49,979
Take thousands, you're a war hero.

309
00:21:50,156 --> 00:21:51,521
This isn't war.

310
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:52,953
Are you sure?

311
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:55,720
It's nothing more than
the Company's little black book.

312
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:59,559
Names, numbers, operation reports.

313
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:04,361
Not everything is as it seems, Michael.

314
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:08,397
But you know that, don't you?

315
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:24,319
Look, we need to re-establish contact
with the buyer.

316
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:28,222
Explain to him what happened,
and set a new location for the exchange.

317
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:30,727
I gotta say I'm amazed at you, Don.

318
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:34,025
All this time you never asked to see
the information in Scylla.

319
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,896
I don't care about the information.
Just what it's worth.

320
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:40,204
Maybe you're worried
if you actually knew what was on it...

321
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:43,308
...you'd have second thoughts
about who you're selling it to.

322
00:22:56,756 --> 00:22:59,281
<i>- Hello?
- We have a hit on the targets.</i>

323
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:01,017
<i>Traffic camera picked them up...</i>

324
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:03,628
<i>... entering a convenience store
on Valley and 14th.</i>

325
00:23:05,632 --> 00:23:07,623
Looks like they left a footprint.

326
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:46,435
Don't move.

327
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:51,504
That's a hell of a job, Agent Lang.

328
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:54,509
You taught me how to read
the mind of a convict, remember?

329
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:57,445
If you take me in, I'm as good as dead,
you know that.

330
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:01,876
So I'm gonna run now.

331
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:05,080
If you need to stop me,
you're gonna have to shoot.

332
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,883
Don't make me do this.

333
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:09,084
I'm sorry.

334
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:13,098
Another time, another place...

335
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:16,394
...hey, Felicia?
- I will pull this trigger.

336
00:24:33,787 --> 00:24:36,688
- What happened?
- He got away.

337
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:37,948
Did you have him?

338
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:40,452
Yeah. L...

339
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:43,687
I thought I had him in my sights.
I just missed.

340
00:24:43,863 --> 00:24:46,832
Did you see which way he went,
or did you just miss that too?

341
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:49,662
Okay, I think he went east.

342
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,010
- Hey, buddy.
- What's up?

343
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:08,211
Looking for a tall chick
with black hair...

344
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:10,219
...and a guy. A tall guy.

345
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,823
He looks like Bozo the Clown.

346
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:13,322
You know, Bozo and Elvira?

347
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:16,952
You guys cops or something?

348
00:25:17,163 --> 00:25:18,562
You're not even close.

349
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:22,900
So how about it?

350
00:25:23,403 --> 00:25:26,201
No, I don't remember anyone like that.

351
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:29,773
How about now, you punk?

352
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:31,101
- How about now?
- Okay.

353
00:25:31,344 --> 00:25:33,676
- They bought a phone, man.
- I want the receipt.

354
00:25:43,356 --> 00:25:45,790
- On their way.
- You have any idea who the buyer is?

355
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:49,758
No. We never will. Whoever's walking
away with the information on Scylla...

356
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:52,921
...will do whatever it takes
to stay below the Company radar.

357
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:56,557
Would you screw some guy's wife
and leave your card on his pillow?

358
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,432
Isn't that what you just did
to the general?

359
00:25:59,606 --> 00:26:01,073
Come on.

360
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:03,607
After all we've been through,
we can't be honest?

361
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:07,110
Your little photo shoot, and your
weak-ass attempt at the sixth card.

362
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,248
You wanted him to know
you were involved.

363
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:11,076
Come on. He punished you.

364
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:13,719
He treated you like crap
just like your real daddy.

365
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:17,322
You want at least one of them
to pay for it, right?

366
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:18,718
Come on, I know you.

367
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:21,124
I did my homework.

368
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:26,425
Gee, Don, you just cracked
my whole Electra complex wide open.

369
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:28,464
It's kudos.

370
00:26:28,668 --> 00:26:30,932
You're not the only
one who did their homework.

371
00:26:31,104 --> 00:26:33,629
- Just so you know.
- Yeah, you got something to say?

372
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,240
Now, we need to be ready
for whatever's coming.

373
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:38,171
You better watch your 6, Don.

374
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:40,178
Okay.

375
00:26:42,248 --> 00:26:43,408
You wanted to see me?

376
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:47,178
I can't quite tell from the monitors,
but from what I can see, the growth...

377
00:26:47,353 --> 00:26:50,584
I mean, it looks like
it isn't just on the hypothalamus.

378
00:26:50,757 --> 00:26:53,590
I understand
that was the initial diagnosis.

379
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,091
But once we got in there...

380
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:58,788
...it appears to have spread
to the hippocampus as well.

381
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:00,091
Okay.

382
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,962
So with the removal,
will there be any memory loss?

383
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:07,003
Well, in cases like this, where
small portions have to be removed...

384
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:10,074
...it hardly ever affects
what's referred to as net memory.

385
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:12,642
We're all tapped
into such small portions...

386
00:27:12,812 --> 00:27:15,337
...of what we've experienced
in our lifetime.

387
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:17,516
The bulk of it
is just kept in storage...

388
00:27:17,684 --> 00:27:19,948
...rarely acknowledged
by the conscious mind.

389
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:22,986
So while there may be
some gross memory loss...

390
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:26,681
...he won't ever know it's gone,
because he'll never know it was there.

391
00:27:55,255 --> 00:27:57,723
- Nurse?
- BP's dropping, 90/60.

392
00:27:57,891 --> 00:27:59,859
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

393
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,118
Increase dopamine delivery rate
to 12.5.

394
00:28:08,635 --> 00:28:10,159
Bargain.

395
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:12,366
Exploding all over the...

396
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:17,275
If you're you smart, use bargain.

397
00:28:18,177 --> 00:28:20,839
Use bargain when the time is right.

398
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:23,073
Bargain.

399
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:26,245
EEG's spiking.
Brain activity's all over the place.

400
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:28,683
- MAP's at 55.
- BP's erratic, dropping.

401
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:31,118
- Eight-five, 84.
- Give him one mil of atropine.

402
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,156
Michael, are you still with us?

403
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,728
The best minds in the world designed
this system and you almost beat it.

404
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:43,235
As long as we have Scylla.

405
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,667
We now have Scylla.

406
00:28:49,742 --> 00:28:51,676
So, what are you hearing
Scylla's worth?

407
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:54,608
Me, I'm hearing millions.

408
00:28:55,882 --> 00:28:59,249
Things have happened in the past
few days that have made me uneasy.

409
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:02,320
As long as we have Scylla,
we have power.

410
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:10,820
I'm sorry, Michael.

411
00:29:11,064 --> 00:29:12,998
- We're losing him.
- Get the crash cart.

412
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:14,790
- Laryngeal scope, intubate.
- No.

413
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:16,195
What's going on?

414
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:17,596
It's time to go.

415
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,105
Michael? Michael!

416
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:35,285
Michael!

417
00:29:35,455 --> 00:29:36,820
Why's he crashing?

418
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:38,285
- You cannot...
- It's okay.

419
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:39,788
- It's okay.
- Don't do this.

420
00:29:39,993 --> 00:29:41,426
Don't do this.

421
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:43,492
Don't do this. Don't go.

422
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,958
We're not finished.

423
00:29:45,164 --> 00:29:46,290
We're not finished yet.

424
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:48,592
Michael, I'm sorry. It's time.

425
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:51,803
- Please, Charles.
- Michael, not like this.

426
00:29:52,005 --> 00:29:54,235
- Not like this.
- It doesn't happen like this.

427
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,805
We'd finish this together.

428
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:57,340
It's okay.

429
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,636
You've done your part.

430
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:01,814
- I haven't figured it out yet.
- Yes, you have.

431
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:03,175
Would you do something?

432
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,044
I'm trying.

433
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:06,979
Fifteen and dropping.

434
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:09,313
Michael, don't leave. Don't give up.

435
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,690
Relax.

436
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:19,158
You might think it's bad, but it's not.

437
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:23,067
- Dying?
- No.

438
00:30:26,672 --> 00:30:27,866
Don't give up.

439
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:30,271
Don't give up. Don't give up.

440
00:30:47,226 --> 00:30:49,888
Not everything is as it seems.

441
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:52,994
Goodbye, Michael.

442
00:30:55,101 --> 00:30:56,227
Charles.

443
00:31:17,557 --> 00:31:19,184
Michael.

444
00:31:19,392 --> 00:31:20,518
Michael, don't leave.

445
00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:23,061
Don't you dare leave me.

446
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:31,898
Sara.

447
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:42,370
Sara.

448
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:45,974
The Company tracked the serial code
off the receipt.

449
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:48,915
Gretchen just placed a call
matching the tracking number.

450
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:50,715
- From where?
- Two miles away.

451
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:01,661
- I was told there'd be three of you.
- Well, there aren't. You have the money?

452
00:32:01,868 --> 00:32:05,235
- That's a small case for 125 million.
- We don't deal in cash.

453
00:32:05,404 --> 00:32:07,463
Once I verify the validity of the item...

454
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,167
...the funds will be wired
to an account number you provide.

455
00:32:18,518 --> 00:32:20,076
- The item please.
- No, no, no.

456
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:22,744
You're not gonna see the item
until I see the money.

457
00:32:22,922 --> 00:32:26,323
You have to forgive me if I don't
trust a shiny case with some buttons.

458
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:29,620
I need to confirm
that the data is intact.

459
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:34,630
Without it, the item you possess
is nothing more than a fancy box.

460
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:36,999
Speaking of...

461
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,105
- Give this man the item.
- No, I'm not giving anyone any...

462
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:43,434
This is a businessman
making a business transaction.

463
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,506
One where the longer you take,
the more danger you put us all in.

464
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:07,491
Can you read what's on there?

465
00:33:09,202 --> 00:33:10,794
You better hope so.

466
00:33:29,188 --> 00:33:31,850
They're not gonna give us Scylla.
Know what that means?

467
00:33:34,894 --> 00:33:36,156
Good.

468
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:50,107
Let's split up.

469
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:01,611
It doesn't look like
the Company's black book. It's...

470
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,385
It looks more like a...

471
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,492
I'm sure you understand,
no one can know where Scylla's going.

472
00:34:36,922 --> 00:34:38,719
It's your lucky day, sugar.

473
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:41,226
Not yours.

474
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,597
Drop it.

475
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:48,395
Cover her.

476
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:56,134
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

477
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:58,003
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

478
00:34:58,177 --> 00:34:59,974
Gone. Stolen.

479
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:02,939
By who?

480
00:35:04,817 --> 00:35:08,810
- By who?
- Lf I die, you'll never know.

481
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:51,625
You look beautiful.

482
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:54,866
You're a liar.

483
00:35:56,535 --> 00:35:58,526
How'd it go?

484
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:00,832
They're still running some tests.

485
00:36:01,006 --> 00:36:03,133
But they feel confident they got it all.

486
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:05,609
And what is this place?

487
00:36:06,178 --> 00:36:09,147
You didn't know something
about your surgery.

488
00:36:09,915 --> 00:36:12,577
It was performed
by Company doctors.

489
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:14,913
And the general
made all the arrangements.

490
00:36:15,154 --> 00:36:17,645
- Why?
- I don't know.

491
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:20,722
Lincoln's handling it.
He says he has a plan.

492
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:22,519
I'll be honest.

493
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:25,357
Right now, you're alive,
and that's all I care about.

494
00:36:28,434 --> 00:36:31,267
You're gonna laugh,
but I had a dream about Scylla.

495
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:36,137
The only thing we really know about it
is what Self told us.

496
00:36:36,342 --> 00:36:37,502
You need to rest.

497
00:36:37,676 --> 00:36:41,077
I'm serious. What if it's not just
the Company's little black book?

498
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:42,544
What if it's...

499
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:44,739
Not everything is as it seems.

500
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:47,375
- Something more?

501
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,278
Like what?

502
00:36:50,222 --> 00:36:52,383
Something good.

503
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:56,755
Why go to so much trouble
to protect information about the past?

504
00:36:56,929 --> 00:37:02,265
Information the Company could
just delete anytime they wanted to.

505
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:04,027
The general said:

506
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:07,168
<i>For as long as we have Scylla,
we have power.</i>

507
00:37:09,074 --> 00:37:12,373
I don't think he was talking
about power, like control or influence.

508
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:14,274
I think he was talking about energy.

509
00:37:15,714 --> 00:37:16,942
Boron.

510
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:18,377
Argon.

511
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:21,719
Gallium.

512
00:37:22,388 --> 00:37:24,447
Indium.

513
00:37:25,224 --> 00:37:26,282
"Bargain."

514
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,121
There's a theory
that if you can find a way...

515
00:37:30,296 --> 00:37:34,130
...to combine these elements
into the design of a solar cell...

516
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:38,099
...you can harness
100 percent of the sun's energy.

517
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:44,308
With that kind of power,
possibilities are limitless.

518
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:47,642
It would certainly explain
all the security around Scylla.

519
00:37:50,015 --> 00:37:53,746
They're not protecting the past.
They're protecting the future.

520
00:37:54,854 --> 00:37:57,152
I wonder what else is on it. I mean...

521
00:37:57,323 --> 00:38:00,224
The equipment,
and the drugs they gave you...

522
00:38:00,426 --> 00:38:02,656
...none of it exists
on the open market.

523
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:06,161
Which would explain why
people would be willing to pay millions...

524
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:07,993
...to get their hands on Scylla.

525
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:13,370
It's not about taking down the Company.
It's about becoming the Company.

526
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,733
It's about knowing what they know.

527
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:17,875
Controlling what they know.

528
00:38:19,144 --> 00:38:20,668
What do we do now?

529
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:28,811
So, what's the next move?

530
00:38:28,988 --> 00:38:30,353
I'm gonna check on Michael.

531
00:38:30,523 --> 00:38:32,491
No, I mean, after that?

532
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:35,627
Scylla's out there.
Are we really gonna keep chasing it?

533
00:38:35,794 --> 00:38:37,887
I don't know. Figure it out later.

534
00:38:38,063 --> 00:38:39,690
No.

535
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:41,857
I won't be here, Linc.

536
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:45,869
I can't do it anymore.

537
00:38:46,038 --> 00:38:49,633
Sara said Mike was okay,
and that's all I needed to know.

538
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:52,276
But now I gotta go and live my life.

539
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:55,914
And that's the life where I can go a day
without seeing a dead body...

540
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:58,515
...or almost becoming one.

541
00:39:00,686 --> 00:39:04,884
<i>I'm not running away, papi.
I'm just moving on.</i>

542
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:08,522
This was never about you.

543
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:10,888
Everything you did, you did for us.

544
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:14,031
I'll never forget that.

545
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:21,336
I know you got something cooking,
so whatever it is, just be careful, okay?

546
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:24,803
Yeah.

547
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:30,678
Thank you.

548
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:34,944
Hey.

549
00:39:36,822 --> 00:39:39,586
When you and Mike get down below
and open that surf shop...

550
00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:40,917
Scuba shop.

551
00:39:41,126 --> 00:39:42,855
Scuba shop.

552
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:45,863
Maybe there will be a job there
for me.

553
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:47,089
You can count on it.

554
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:02,542
Do you know who took it?

555
00:40:02,715 --> 00:40:05,047
No. But Self and Gretchen do.

556
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,308
Good.

557
00:40:06,485 --> 00:40:09,613
- Then you've got your team.
- I'm not working for them.

558
00:40:09,855 --> 00:40:13,120
You'll work with a hound in a hat
if that's what I tell you to do.

559
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,419
That's what being an employee
means.

560
00:40:16,962 --> 00:40:20,762
You're determined, and dedicated,
but there are holes in your résumé...

561
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:24,767
...that Gretchen, or Self,
or even Bagwell can fill.

562
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:29,498
Now, you all took something from me,
and you are all going to get it back.

563
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:31,869
Besides...

564
00:40:32,678 --> 00:40:35,146
...you can't handle this by yourself.

565
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:38,506
And deep down I think you know that.

566
00:40:40,152 --> 00:40:42,017
Have them meet me outside.

567
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:45,786
Who knows?

568
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:50,487
You may find that you like it here.
Stranger things have happened.

569
00:40:50,696 --> 00:40:52,994
They've certainly happened
in your family.

570
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:57,294
Now, about Michael.

571
00:40:58,971 --> 00:41:01,098
Are you gonna tell him...

572
00:41:01,507 --> 00:41:02,997
...or should I?

573
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:14,945
<i>Do you have it?</i>

574
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,212
In my hand.

575
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:19,050
<i>Good. You know what to do.</i>

576
00:41:35,307 --> 00:41:38,743
Last time I saw you in a hospital,
you busted your arm in Little League.

577
00:41:38,944 --> 00:41:41,811
Some bruiser knocked me down
sliding into second.

578
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,072
Sorry about that.

579
00:41:43,248 --> 00:41:46,240
- But you healed good though, right?
- Yeah.

580
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:49,044
This will too.

581
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:54,591
Whatever plan to get us out of here,
we better make a move on it.

582
00:41:55,094 --> 00:41:57,528
You're not getting out of here,
Michael.

583
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:01,691
What do you mean?

584
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:04,495
I made a deal,
your life in exchange for Scylla.

585
00:42:07,072 --> 00:42:08,198
Why would you do that?

586
00:42:08,373 --> 00:42:12,400
Same reason you covered your body
in tattoos, and broke into Fox River.

587
00:42:12,611 --> 00:42:15,409
- This is not just about us.
- It's exactly who it's about.

588
00:42:15,581 --> 00:42:17,549
It's all it's ever been about.

589
00:42:19,551 --> 00:42:23,180
We do this one thing for the Company,
and they set us up for life.

590
00:42:23,355 --> 00:42:25,186
And you actually trust them?

591
00:42:26,024 --> 00:42:29,118
Who else am I gonna trust?
The government, guys like Don Self?

592
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:31,888
I'm done watching loved ones
and friends die, Michael.

593
00:42:32,064 --> 00:42:34,794
Scylla's not what we thought it was.

594
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,798
- Not even close.
- I don't care.

595
00:42:38,036 --> 00:42:39,936
I don't understand
how you can say that.

596
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:42,232
The only thing worth fighting for
is family.

597
00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:45,308
I'm gonna do everything
and anything I can to end this.

598
00:42:45,544 --> 00:42:48,513
So you, me,
all of us can get on with our lives.

599
00:42:48,714 --> 00:42:51,649
You think you can do that
knowing what you know?

600
00:42:51,884 --> 00:42:54,216
You wanna know
what I know about the Company?

601
00:42:54,386 --> 00:42:56,820
Mom worked for them
before she died.

602
00:42:59,158 --> 00:43:02,286
I'm just moving on
to the family business.

603
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:04,952
- Linc, don't do this.
- It's done.

604
00:43:05,164 --> 00:43:06,791
Linc. Linc!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
