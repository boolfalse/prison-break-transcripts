1
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,512
<i>My name is Michael Scofield...</i>

2
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:10,053
<i>... and I'm a fugitive.</i>

3
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:16,562
<i>Three weeks ago,
I was in a Panamanian prison.</i>

4
00:00:18,764 --> 00:00:21,392
<i>While I was there,
I was approached by the Company.</i>

5
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:25,202
<i>The Company is a corrupt organization...</i>

6
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:28,135
<i>... involved in all levels of industry
and government.</i>

7
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:31,608
<i>They gave me two options:</i>

8
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:35,311
<i>Break one of their men, James Whistler,
out of that prison...</i>

9
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:40,147
<i>... or else they would kill
the only woman I ever loved...</i>

10
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:41,786
<i>... Dr. Sara Tancredi.</i>

11
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:47,788
<i>I held up my end of the deal
and I broke Whistler out.</i>

12
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:50,060
<i>But the Company...</i>

13
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:53,461
<i>... they killed Sara anyway.</i>

14
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,135
<i>I don't know why the Company
wanted James Whistler out of prison...</i>

15
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:03,969
<i>... but I've tracked him here
to Los Angeles.</i>

16
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:08,072
<i>He's with another Company agent
I know only as Gretchen.</i>

17
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:12,774
<i>The same agent who murdered Sara.</i>

18
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:15,918
<i>This ends today.</i>

19
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:20,122
<i>I came here seeking justice.</i>

20
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:23,120
<i>The justice I now know
the system cannot provide.</i>

21
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:28,660
<i>So if you're reading this letter...</i>

22
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:30,961
<i>... you'll know I died
avenging Sara's death.</i>

23
00:01:56,362 --> 00:02:00,162
You get the data card, we drop it off
in the racing forum and we get out of there.

24
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,769
- Who's the contact we're leaving it for?
- The Company wants the card back.

25
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:07,838
Period. All you need to worry about
is getting this rig out of there in a hurry.

26
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:11,340
Oh, I'll be getting it out of there,
don't you worry about that.

27
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,071
You worry about getting your ass
back in that seat in time.

28
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:19,040
You pull this off...

29
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:22,984
...you can come up to my room later and
the word "no" won't be in my vocabulary.

30
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:26,022
Just make sure we get paid.

31
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:01,517
In and out.

32
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:49,668
- Good to see you again.
- You too.

33
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:53,073
Didn't hear from you.
Started to wonder if you were interested.

34
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:54,269
I am, very much so.

35
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:57,644
Well, I needed to approach this carefully.
I'm sure you understand.

36
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:02,611
Who are you buying it for? A competitor?

37
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:06,986
- A foreign country?
- Jason, you know I can't get into that.

38
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:11,187
We've been negotiating this for months.
I've jumped through all your hoops.

39
00:04:11,363 --> 00:04:13,194
I've agreed to meet you here.

40
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:19,160
Do you wanna sell the card to me or not?

41
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,213
Be right back.

42
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:49,196
That's a lot of secrets
on a little piece of plastic.

43
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:52,330
Let me give you a little bit of advice.

44
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:56,236
And this is on the house.

45
00:04:56,475 --> 00:04:58,136
Watch your step with that thing.

46
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:00,569
The Company will do anything
to get it back.

47
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:02,577
Don't I know it.

48
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,510
<i>- Yeah?
- What are you doing?</i>

49
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:36,341
<i>- We've gotta get out of here.
- I need to hide the gun.</i>

50
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:38,779
<i>Take the gun with you.</i>

51
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:50,786
Come on.

52
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:53,226
Where is she?

53
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,799
Michael.

54
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:58,264
- You don't understand.
- Call Gretchen.

55
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:00,200
Get her in here, now.

56
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:03,432
You have to trust me.
I'm not your enemy, Michael.

57
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:04,701
James?

58
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,906
We need to leave.

59
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:11,276
You know, despite everything...

60
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,078
...if Sara could weigh in,
she'd tell me not to kill you.

61
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:15,982
That's the kind of person she was.

62
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:18,419
That's the kind of person
you took from me.

63
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:21,287
James, didn't you tell him?

64
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,155
- He walked in five sec...
- Shut up.

65
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:24,489
Gretchen, look at me.

66
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,760
- This is for Sara.
- I never killed Sara.

67
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:32,202
I wouldn't expect someone like you
to take this with dignity.

68
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,771
I swear to God, she's alive.

69
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,932
Don't insult me. And don't insult her.

70
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,840
She escaped. If you found out,
we wouldn't have leverage.

71
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:43,607
- I fabricated the whole thing.
- My brother saw it.

72
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:46,478
A head in a box from a cadaver.

73
00:06:46,652 --> 00:06:49,348
- You ask Lincoln what he really saw.
- Listen to her.

74
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,352
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying to you.

75
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:54,117
Lincoln bought it, you bought it.
It worked.

76
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:58,486
- Michael?
- Then where is she?

77
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:03,260
I'll tell you when we get outside.
Right now, we need to get out of here.

78
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:05,198
They found the bodies.

79
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:08,764
- Give me the gun.
- She's lying.

80
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:11,808
Is she?
If you pull that trigger, you'll never know.

81
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:14,810
- Kill him, James.
- Shut up.

82
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,608
Where is she? Where's Sara?

83
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:19,148
Michael...

84
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:23,311
...if you don't give me that gun,
I'm gonna shoot you in the head.

85
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:36,900
Let's go.

86
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,040
We got a double homicide
at the Roosevelt Hotel.

87
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:04,090
Sara.

88
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:30,420
Do you know the difference
between a perfectly executed operation...

89
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:32,022
...and a failed mission?

90
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:35,558
- Sir?
- It's a small-unit leadership.

91
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:39,391
The Allies spent two and a half years
planning the invasion of Normandy.

92
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:43,592
But on D-day, it came down
to a handful of men on a strip of beach...

93
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,067
...to decide the fate of the world.

94
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,331
What I'm getting at, Gretchen,
is even the best plan...

95
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,774
...is only as good as the moving parts
on the ground executing it.

96
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:57,177
General, we got your card.
What's the problem?

97
00:08:57,349 --> 00:09:00,250
We have nothing. It's a duplicate.

98
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:01,613
Almost flawless...

99
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:04,982
...but a duplicate.
- That's impossible. I saw...

100
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:08,593
You know how important the retrieval
of this card is to me, Gretchen.

101
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,729
You know that this is a security breach...

102
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:14,730
...that could have catastrophic ramifications
for the Company.

103
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,834
The only thing I can think of...

104
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:20,228
...there was a blind spot
when Whistler was hitting the target.

105
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:22,965
Maybe he made a duplicate
and he still has the original.

106
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:24,733
You hired him.

107
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:30,072
You kept him at the tip of the spear.
You insisted that we get him out of Sona.

108
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:33,713
We had to.
He'd already made contact with the target.

109
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:35,786
At that point, it was him or no one, sir.

110
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:39,349
What's your stake in all this?

111
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:44,519
I had nothing to do with it.
Whistler acted on his own, I swear to you.

112
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:47,324
General, I can fix this.

113
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:51,863
- You trained me.
- Not well enough, apparently.

114
00:09:54,873 --> 00:09:56,864
You know what to do.

115
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:02,379
Please. I have a bank account in Dubai.

116
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:05,312
Left over from a slush fund from Cobra II.
It's yours.

117
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,349
No, please. Please.

118
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:16,392
Hello?

119
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:19,463
<i>- Hey, it's me.
- Where are you, man?</i>

120
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:20,962
Los Angeles.

121
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:24,125
<i>- You okay, Michael?
- No, I'm safe.</i>

122
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:25,964
Thank God. Thank God.

123
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:29,999
- How's L. J? How's Sofia?
- Yeah, they're...

124
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:33,576
I'm starring at them right now.
They're fine.

125
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:36,270
- Did you hear about Sona?
- What about it?

126
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:37,779
Burned down three days back.

127
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,545
The inmates, they rioted.
No sign of Bellick, T-Bag or Sucre.

128
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,553
- Sucre?
- He got popped. I don't know how.

129
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:49,160
The papers listed the names of the inmates
and he was there when it went down.

130
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:51,558
I found Whistler and Gretchen.

131
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:57,400
And Gretchen said...

132
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:01,569
She said Sara's still alive.

133
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:08,338
- What did you see, Linc?
- What do you mean what did I see, Michael?

134
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:10,538
I need you to tell me
exactly what you saw.

135
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:12,309
Michael, Sara's gone.

136
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:14,850
You said it was in a garage, right?
So it was dark.

137
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,783
Yeah, it was dark.

138
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:21,888
But if you're asking me
if I picked up the head...

139
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,756
...to check to see if it was Sara,
no, Michael, I didn't.

140
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,989
And L.J. Said...

141
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,964
...he only heard them kill Sara, right?

142
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:33,600
You just gotta come back.
Please, come back. Let's just...

143
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:35,296
Let's just start a new life.

144
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:39,608
Tell Sofia I said hi. And tell L. J...

145
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:43,648
- Tell him his uncle loves him.
- Michael, don't do this, please.

146
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
Out, out.

147
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:10,566
You could use some better ventilation
back there, amigo.

148
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:13,575
- Wanna translate that?
- Don't worry about it.

149
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:19,313
- Where's your mom?
- She'll be here.

150
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,475
What do you mean?
We're running out of time.

151
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,280
- I gotta be up there.
- Don't worry.

152
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:25,548
My mom wouldn't let me down.

153
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:28,619
At least she hasn't yet.

154
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:32,121
Bradley, over here.

155
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:35,698
Mom, Mom. I told you.
Don't worry, you'll make it there.

156
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:49,940
- What was it called?
- Europeangoldfinch. Net.

157
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:52,310
That's what we can all use
to communicate.

158
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:22,946
Michael.

159
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,718
Don't worry, I'm alone.

160
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:34,486
- It's good to see you.
- So where's your new best friend?

161
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,754
I don't know about that,
but Whistler's not who you think he is.

162
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,899
We're working together
against the Company.

163
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:45,263
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

164
00:13:45,437 --> 00:13:47,871
Well, what about Gretchen?
Is she working with you?

165
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:50,870
He needed her to further his plan.

166
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:54,774
If the guy was Company, he'd have
shot you dead back at that conference.

167
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:58,074
Do you have any information
about Sara or not?

168
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:03,479
- Let's go somewhere a little more private.
- I want you to tell me right now.

169
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:06,089
I want you tell me right now, right here.

170
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:08,726
- We can get Gretchen on the phone.
- Gretchen's dead.

171
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:10,353
She never showed up.

172
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,393
Come and talk to me, please.

173
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,301
Whistler and I were at that conference
to get a data card.

174
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:24,499
It's like the Company's black book.

175
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:27,645
It lists all their agents,
all their operations.

176
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:30,543
They refer to it as Scylla.

177
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:33,348
- Whistler's got it.
- Alex, talk to me about Sara.

178
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:34,610
That's all I care about.

179
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:38,813
I understand that. I want nothing more
than to get home to my wife and my son.

180
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:42,393
But that's not gonna happen
with the Company trying to kill us.

181
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:46,327
- You don't know anything about Sara.
- Whistler does. He tells me he does.

182
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:48,995
And he wants to tell you.

183
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:52,329
- But he wants something in return.
- What? What does he want from me?

184
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:53,562
To talk to you.

185
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:09,279
I'm sorry about the other night.
If I had time, I would have explained better.

186
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:11,615
I'm sure. What are we doing here?

187
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,621
- Alex told you about Scylla?
- Yes.

188
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:17,956
I have it. There's one last step involved
in order to read the data.

189
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,826
And that step involves
breaking into a secured structure.

190
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,331
- So now you need my help?
- Yeah.

191
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:26,096
The bird book I lost in Sona
contained information...

192
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:30,264
...that would have helped facilitate the
break-in, but it can still be accomplished...

193
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:31,500
...with your help.

194
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:33,200
Where's Sara?

195
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:36,639
The only thing I know for sure:

196
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,013
A week ago, some information
came through the wire.

197
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:42,676
Sara may have bought a bus ticket
in Santa Fe.

198
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:43,878
Headed where?

199
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:45,683
Chicago.

200
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:48,951
Michael, if Sara's out there,
she's not safe. None of us are.

201
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:50,856
The Company knows we have the card...

202
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:53,224
...and that's why Gretchen
was the first to go.

203
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:58,562
- I think we're done here.
- Michael, we have a chance, for once...

204
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:01,231
...to get Scylla to people
that wanna take the Company down.

205
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:04,842
I don't wanna run anymore.
We won't have to run anymore.

206
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:09,611
I spent the last month thinking
Sara was dead and that it was my fault.

207
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:12,045
If she's out there, I'm gonna find her.

208
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:16,153
- That's all I care about.
- This can be done within a week. Less.

209
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:17,913
At least let me show you...

210
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:01,231
Oh, I'm gonna miss these gams, girl.

211
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,629
Then don't go.

212
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:06,236
This ain't no home for a white boy
from Alabama.

213
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:11,133
They're here, señor. The bags are packed.

214
00:17:24,756 --> 00:17:27,224
You kept your word to me.

215
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,325
You're the first that's ever done that.

216
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:34,425
Why must you go after this man?

217
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:36,559
You could choose not to.

218
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:41,035
Where I come from,
there's something called a blood feud.

219
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:42,697
Yes.

220
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:46,935
Michael Scofield left me for dead
one too many times, as it turns out.

221
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:50,074
What is Spanish for little angel?

222
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:57,450
<i>Adios, Angelita.</i>

223
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:08,027
<i>- Is this legit?
- Oh, si, señor.</i>

224
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:12,295
For the money you're paying,
first class all the way.

225
00:18:13,104 --> 00:18:16,005
<i>- So are these coyotes one can trust?
- Si, señor.</i>

226
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:46,634
As you've seen,
what you're entering into is quite serious.

227
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:50,798
- I realize that.
- You're responsible for this now.

228
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:53,205
You have nothing to worry about.

229
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:55,709
We'll talk soon.

230
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:02,119
It's time to clean up now...

231
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:03,578
...thoroughly.

232
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:06,724
Everyone who was close to Whistler.

233
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:08,882
Scofield...

234
00:19:09,294 --> 00:19:11,524
...Mahone, Burrows.

235
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:14,062
Burrows is still in Panama.

236
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:16,200
Clean up.

237
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:28,736
Hello?

238
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,577
Hi, Pam.

239
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:35,582
Where? Where are you?

240
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:37,787
You know...

241
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,390
...in the middle of it, as usual.

242
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:42,622
- Panama still?
- No.

243
00:19:43,061 --> 00:19:44,187
No.

244
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:45,886
Are you okay?

245
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:47,730
Definitely.

246
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:52,532
- Are you?
- Yes.

247
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:54,365
<i>And Cameron?</i>

248
00:19:55,473 --> 00:19:56,963
He's fine.

249
00:19:57,142 --> 00:20:01,169
I have to tell you, Pam.
You know, I had a plan...

250
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:03,538
...for all of us to be together...

251
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:09,848
...and I'm not gonna stop working on it.

252
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:13,347
Why do you need a plan
if you wanna be with someone?

253
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,790
You just be with them.

254
00:20:18,663 --> 00:20:21,427
Don't say that unless you mean it.

255
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,966
Because I'll turn this world upside down
to get back to you.

256
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:27,627
So don't say it unless you mean it.

257
00:20:28,373 --> 00:20:30,000
I mean it.

258
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,702
Okay.

259
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:38,807
Come on, babe, I hate plantains.
You know that.

260
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:43,283
- I tried your chili burgers.
- Chili burger? You loved the chili burger.

261
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,980
Okay, I'm gonna make them
with my mom's special recipe.

262
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:48,523
- Your mom's special recipe?
- You'll love it.

263
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:51,253
- Really?
- Yeah, you'll love them. Trust me.

264
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:54,197
It's delicious.

265
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,463
Oh, here, that's good.

266
00:20:57,635 --> 00:20:59,603
Let's get out of here. Drop them.
Let's go.

267
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:02,205
- I haven't paid for them.
- Give me your hand. L.J.

268
00:21:02,373 --> 00:21:04,000
- Let's go.
- Lincoln?

269
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:07,941
- Come with me.
- Lincoln, what's going on?

270
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:11,043
Dad, we're safe now.

271
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:13,815
- Relax.
- No. I saw someone.

272
00:21:13,985 --> 00:21:16,146
Looks like Company. I'm sure of it.

273
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:19,051
Let's just go, okay? Let's go.

274
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,655
- We'll be fine.
- All right. All right.

275
00:21:23,828 --> 00:21:25,056
Yeah.

276
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:32,496
Get back, get back.

277
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:47,044
Dad!

278
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,186
Dad, we have to run.

279
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,787
Go.

280
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:03,666
- Run.
- Lincoln.

281
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:04,995
Lincoln.

282
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:25,222
I'm looking for Alex.

283
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:27,451
I don't know where he is.

284
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:31,957
- No?
- No.

285
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,030
We've been divorced
for almost two years.

286
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:35,893
We haven't had contact in months.

287
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:39,901
I would think that might change
now that he's back in the U.S.

288
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,532
You know, I'm so sick of you people.

289
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,506
What are you, a fed?
Thinking you can keep on harassing me?

290
00:22:46,678 --> 00:22:48,475
I'm not with the government, ma'am.

291
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,280
Mom, could you come here?

292
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:54,983
We're done talking.

293
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:40,088
- Bruce Bennett.
- Do you know who this is?

294
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:45,929
- I do.
- I'm looking for Sara.

295
00:23:46,504 --> 00:23:49,496
<i>Right now, you're the only person
I can think of who can help me.</i>

296
00:23:49,974 --> 00:23:51,464
Hold on.

297
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:04,313
- Where are you?
- Back in Chicago.

298
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:07,720
- Have you heard from her?
- Meet me in The Drake Hotel in a half hour.

299
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,889
Please, just tell me. Is she alive?

300
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:15,058
Are you Michael Scofield?

301
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:20,737
Are you Michael Scofield?

302
00:24:24,442 --> 00:24:25,670
<i>- Yes, I am.
- Michael?</i>

303
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:28,334
<i>- Hands on your head.
- Michael?</i>

304
00:24:41,325 --> 00:24:42,690
Michael Scofield.

305
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,921
Special Agent Don Self,
Homeland Security.

306
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:49,492
Were you there
when James Whistler was killed?

307
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:52,765
- I didn't kill him.
- I know you didn't.

308
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:56,371
He was an independent contractor...

309
00:24:57,475 --> 00:25:00,035
...who worked for the Company
for about 10 years.

310
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:03,203
He was assigned to retrieve Scylla
once it went missing.

311
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:10,080
- You know what Scylla is?
- It's the Company's little black book.

312
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:13,121
So he was gonna make a copy of it
and give it to me.

313
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:17,387
- What do you want from me?
- You're looking at major time.

314
00:25:17,562 --> 00:25:18,620
You know that, right?

315
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:24,093
So how would you like
to walk away from it all?

316
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:25,428
Not do a day.

317
00:25:25,603 --> 00:25:27,901
- In exchange for?
- Scylla.

318
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:33,570
All right. Sara Tancredi.
Last seen in Panama.

319
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:37,039
If you help me find her,
maybe we've got a deal.

320
00:25:37,215 --> 00:25:41,049
- Sorry, she's not my department. Scylla is.
- Then go find it yourself.

321
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:43,551
Seems the U.S. Government
should have more reach...

322
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:45,882
...than someone
who's looking at major time.

323
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:47,821
To perform the operation...

324
00:25:47,992 --> 00:25:51,928
...that would require signatures
from about 20 different department heads.

325
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:54,394
You wanna bet
at least one of them is Company?

326
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:58,963
And the only way this is gonna work
is via freelancer, off the books.

327
00:25:59,137 --> 00:26:00,627
Sounds complicated.

328
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,198
- I'll pass.
- I'm giving you an opportunity...

329
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:04,966
...to avoid 15 years in jail.

330
00:26:05,443 --> 00:26:07,570
Not to mention
the time your brother's facing.

331
00:26:07,745 --> 00:26:12,546
- What are you talking about?
- Company tried to take him out in Panama.

332
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:17,051
He reacted, apparently.

333
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:19,485
I made a deal
with the Panamanian authorities...

334
00:26:19,657 --> 00:26:21,386
...to serve out his time in the U.S.

335
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:24,027
He should be touching ground
any time now.

336
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:31,194
You recognize this handwriting?

337
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,965
This is your father's.

338
00:26:35,306 --> 00:26:39,174
He spent the last two years of his life
going after this very thing.

339
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,145
Do you believe in fate, Michael?

340
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:51,687
I think I'd like to talk to my brother.

341
00:26:57,962 --> 00:26:59,657
Oh, no.

342
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:05,631
Oh, no.

343
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:12,400
What's going on? What's going on?

344
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:16,237
- Stop. Stop.
- Hey.

345
00:27:16,414 --> 00:27:18,712
Hey, hey, you don't wanna go in there.

346
00:27:18,883 --> 00:27:21,044
You don't wanna go in there.

347
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:28,390
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

348
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:53,845
Oh, she's...

349
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:56,776
Lilah Maria Sucre.

350
00:27:57,288 --> 00:27:59,381
She gave her my name?

351
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:16,297
You setting me up?

352
00:28:16,474 --> 00:28:19,932
Sucre, look,
you can't keep bringing Maricruz down.

353
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:22,807
You can't do this to her anymore.

354
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:24,905
Sucre.

355
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,151
Wait. Don't go. Don't... Sucre, don't.

356
00:28:30,054 --> 00:28:32,386
- Go. Go. Go.
- Oh, boy.

357
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:46,899
- We're screwed.
- Let's go, get out. Right now.

358
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:50,898
You know why Scofield gets all twisted up
when he's around me?

359
00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:54,470
We're the same.
And he just can't stand it.

360
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,613
Drives his ass crazy.

361
00:28:57,214 --> 00:29:01,082
We got the same brilliant mind,
the same natural-born-leader tendencies...

362
00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:04,312
...same one-in-a-million-type charisma,
yes?

363
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:07,280
He just gonna look down his nose at me?

364
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:09,318
How you gonna find him?

365
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:14,330
- This.
- You're both into birds?

366
00:29:14,498 --> 00:29:15,863
No, no.

367
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:19,469
It's either gonna take me to him
or him to me.

368
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,030
I just know it.

369
00:29:21,205 --> 00:29:24,504
<i>If I was you, I'd forget this Scofield.
You have plenty of money, si?</i>

370
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:27,166
I mean, how much money you have
in that bag?

371
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:30,405
Why don't you just mind
your own beeswax, huh?

372
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:34,611
You just keep pointing this jalopy
northbound, all right?

373
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:36,776
Get me back to the land of cotton.

374
00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:38,717
Of course.

375
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:40,413
Ready.

376
00:30:00,978 --> 00:30:03,446
A few people in government
will know of the operation.

377
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:07,380
And it has to stay that way or people's lives
will be in danger. Mine included.

378
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:10,816
Taking down the Company sounds
a little bigger than a two-man job, cop.

379
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:13,980
- I'm gonna get you help.
- I thought you couldn't trust anybody?

380
00:30:14,158 --> 00:30:17,491
Yeah, but maybe you can.
All right, two of your cohorts...

381
00:30:17,661 --> 00:30:21,654
...Fernando Sucre and Brad Bellick
were arrested. They're both facing time.

382
00:30:21,832 --> 00:30:24,699
And Alexander Mahone
is in a Colorado jail cell.

383
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:27,064
- Let him sit there.
- You're gonna need Mahone...

384
00:30:27,238 --> 00:30:30,366
...if you wanna make this happen.
He was working with Whistler.

385
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:33,510
And you'll have me, okay?
Whatever you need, I'll provide.

386
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:35,941
Whistler also said something
about a second step.

387
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,641
- Something about a break-in.
- Yeah.

388
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:42,047
The card has all the data on it,
but it's encrypted.

389
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:46,246
Once you get your hands on it, find a way
to break into the Company's headquarters.

390
00:30:46,424 --> 00:30:48,016
That's the way to unlock the card.

391
00:30:48,192 --> 00:30:49,921
- Where's the building?
- L.A.

392
00:30:50,094 --> 00:30:51,891
- Where in L. A?
- I don't know.

393
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:54,190
We got a data card
which could be anywhere.

394
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:58,734
We gotta break into a building, the location
of which is yet to be determined. Simple.

395
00:30:58,903 --> 00:31:01,133
You've broken out of two penitentiaries.

396
00:31:01,305 --> 00:31:05,742
I'm thinking breaking into a building
isn't too far outside your wheelhouse.

397
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,104
How do you know our dad?

398
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:11,142
He heard from contacts
that I could be trusted.

399
00:31:11,315 --> 00:31:14,409
- Hey, your father was a good man.
- Why now?

400
00:31:14,585 --> 00:31:17,520
Look, I've been going after the Company
for five years, okay?

401
00:31:17,688 --> 00:31:19,417
When Whistler was killed yesterday...

402
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,525
...the plug was gonna be pulled
on the entire operation.

403
00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:26,629
But I convinced my superiors
to give it one more chance.

404
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:29,664
- So this is like job security for you?
- What's that?

405
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:33,161
Well, we go out and risk our necks
so you can collect your pension.

406
00:31:33,337 --> 00:31:34,668
No, no, no, Lincoln.

407
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:38,468
Some people still care about their jobs.
Some people fight for this country.

408
00:31:38,642 --> 00:31:41,202
Maybe you've been too distracted
boosting car stereos...

409
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:44,040
...and breaking heads to remember that.

410
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,359
We do this deal, after it's done...

411
00:31:57,495 --> 00:32:00,760
...you can look for Sara if she's alive.

412
00:32:01,165 --> 00:32:05,192
If we take this deal, we'll both be dead
long before I get the chance, Linc.

413
00:32:12,776 --> 00:32:14,767
You guys must have
some big-time friends.

414
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:16,674
What are you talking about?

415
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:19,441
Somebody posted
a significant amount of bail for you.

416
00:32:19,617 --> 00:32:22,313
- Who?
- I don't know, but they're outside.

417
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,380
You're free to go.

418
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:28,119
Here, take your dad's file.
My number's inside.

419
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:29,316
We ain't doing this.

420
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:33,224
Well, just take it anyway.
This file means nothing to me anymore.

421
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:51,942
Bruce Bennett.

422
00:32:55,486 --> 00:32:56,976
Let's go for a drive.

423
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:13,586
- Thanks.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

424
00:34:38,522 --> 00:34:40,717
I have something for you.

425
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:46,256
Okay.

426
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,328
You left this behind.

427
00:34:58,008 --> 00:35:01,637
Is that what this is about?
You're just giving me my rose back?

428
00:35:01,812 --> 00:35:05,145
Yeah, I guess I'm done now. I can retire.

429
00:35:08,652 --> 00:35:10,984
How much time are you looking at?

430
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:15,685
They're saying 15 years.

431
00:35:16,727 --> 00:35:18,991
I have to find out for sure.

432
00:35:20,364 --> 00:35:22,764
I heard Lincoln say something
about a deal.

433
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:24,332
No jail time...

434
00:35:25,169 --> 00:35:27,967
...in exchange
for taking down the Company.

435
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:30,764
How?

436
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:33,567
Exactly.

437
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:39,548
I love you.

438
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:42,882
That's all I know right now.

439
00:36:01,538 --> 00:36:04,530
<i>Will you need not yield
To the immortal gods?</i>

440
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:08,769
<i>That nightmare cannot die
Being eternal evil itself...</i>

441
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,648
<i>There is no fighting her
No power can fight her.</i>

442
00:36:13,817 --> 00:36:17,446
Okay, listen. It's up to you now.

443
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,618
<i>All that avails is flight.</i>

444
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:37,634
Hey.

445
00:36:37,808 --> 00:36:41,005
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

446
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:43,469
I'm sorry.

447
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,445
Do you wanna talk about it?

448
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:22,385
It's not your fault.

449
00:37:23,353 --> 00:37:25,150
It's not.

450
00:37:26,557 --> 00:37:28,718
Tell me what happened.

451
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:38,932
It's just the Company.
It's just what they do.

452
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:44,638
And it wasn't just me.
God, it was you and L.J. And Lincoln.

453
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:49,042
And they won't stop.

454
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,649
And I don't know how to deal with that.

455
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:56,677
Hey, come here. Come here.

456
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:58,515
Come here.

457
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:07,855
Let's go.

458
00:38:25,516 --> 00:38:27,381
Are you okay?

459
00:38:27,951 --> 00:38:29,714
I can't believe they found us so fast.

460
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:32,583
Should I call Bruce
and get someplace safe?

461
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:34,315
No place is safe.

462
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:37,217
They're not gonna stop
unless we stop them.

463
00:38:37,394 --> 00:38:39,828
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Let's end this.

464
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:41,726
I'm not gonna leave you behind again.

465
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:52,239
- Yeah?
- We're in.

466
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:04,320
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, papi.</i>

467
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:06,988
Linc.

468
00:39:08,825 --> 00:39:11,293
Can't tell you how grateful I am
for you including me.

469
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:13,395
Well, Sucre vouched for you, Bellick.

470
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:16,624
He said you came through for him
down in Panama.

471
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,126
- Alex.
- Michael.

472
00:39:20,737 --> 00:39:23,968
- You ready for this?
- Yeah, I am.

473
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:28,634
So I hear Whistler's bird book
has details about what we need to steal.

474
00:39:28,812 --> 00:39:31,838
- Yeah.
- You know who's got it, right?

475
00:39:34,618 --> 00:39:37,678
Please. We'll die out here.

476
00:39:37,854 --> 00:39:42,518
Thank you for the cash, gringo.
First class all the way.

477
00:39:47,731 --> 00:39:51,258
- Do we have any idea where T-Bag is?
- That snake could be anywhere.

478
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:54,427
In L.A., we can think like convicts,
we just can't act like them.

479
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:55,731
If we do, we're done.

480
00:39:55,906 --> 00:39:58,670
It goes without saying
this is your last chance to back out.

481
00:39:58,842 --> 00:40:02,835
First on the list of things
I cannot guarantee you is your safety.

482
00:40:05,248 --> 00:40:08,342
We're all a long way
from where this started.

483
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:12,414
But what I can guarantee you
is that if we do this thing right...

484
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:14,921
...we'll be close to where it ends.

485
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:17,151
Freedom.

486
00:40:17,928 --> 00:40:19,555
Finally.

487
00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:24,432
You two, let's go.

488
00:40:26,903 --> 00:40:28,495
Hey, Mike.

489
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:31,140
What about Sara?

490
00:40:33,844 --> 00:40:35,641
Sara's in.

491
00:40:41,518 --> 00:40:46,046
All right, we're heading out tomorrow.
I have to finalize a few things before we go.

492
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:48,282
No games and no stunts.

493
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:52,251
Otherwise, I promise you're gonna see
a whole different side of me.

494
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:55,330
- Likewise.
- Fake IDs.

495
00:40:56,767 --> 00:41:01,033
It's a good start,
but there are some things you can't fake.

496
00:41:01,204 --> 00:41:02,637
And there are some things...

497
00:41:03,774 --> 00:41:05,708
...you can't hide.

498
00:41:07,044 --> 00:41:08,671
Know what I mean?

499
00:41:10,647 --> 00:41:12,638
How high is your threshold for pain?

500
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:19,048
You sure you don't want a sedative?

501
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:24,753
We're gonna go into the night.

502
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:48,778
How do you feel?

503
00:41:48,952 --> 00:41:52,513
Lighter, somehow. Look, I don't know
how we're gonna take them down.

504
00:41:52,689 --> 00:41:56,090
I don't even know who they are,
but I do know one thing:

505
00:41:57,327 --> 00:41:59,693
The Company's gonna pay
for what they did to you.

506
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:04,057
- Let's go.
- Are you sure you're up for this?

507
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:07,369
If we can do it together...

508
00:42:08,171 --> 00:42:09,365
...yeah.

509
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:11,439
- Okay.
- Absolutely.

510
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:18,942
A C-130?

511
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:21,550
What, do they want us
to parachute out of this thing?

512
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:24,551
This guy called in a favor
to the Air Force.

513
00:42:24,721 --> 00:42:27,622
It's not like we can be flying commercial,
you know?

514
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:34,289
If you're successful with obtaining Scylla,
you not only avoid jail time...

515
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:37,524
...but you can take great pride
in knowing you helped dismantle...

516
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:40,761
...this country's greatest threat
to its own democracy.

517
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:44,395
If you're killed while doing so,
a proper funeral will be provided.

518
00:42:45,742 --> 00:42:48,973
But if you try to escape,
you will have no funeral.

519
00:42:49,146 --> 00:42:50,204
You will have nothing.

520
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,248
And you will be apprehended
and buried where we find you.

521
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:57,109
I sincerely hope
we understand each other.

522
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:02,650
You better hold up your end of the deal.

523
00:43:02,826 --> 00:43:04,418
Let's go.

524
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:28,545
They ran the projection you asked for,
general.

525
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,063
You're clear. Go ahead.

526
00:43:42,232 --> 00:43:45,963
There's been a complication. Burrows
and Scofield have been transferred to...

527
00:43:46,136 --> 00:43:47,967
<i>I read the newspapers.</i>

528
00:43:48,138 --> 00:43:50,834
You don't have to tell me
what's in the headlines.

529
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:54,402
The exact penitentiary
where they're being held is undisclosed.

530
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:58,514
But you can guarantee it'll be federal.
Supermax.

531
00:43:58,682 --> 00:44:02,413
No more updates.
Call me when they're dead.

532
00:44:03,753 --> 00:44:05,653
Welcome to Los Angeles.

533
00:44:05,822 --> 00:44:10,418
As it turns out, men who have escaped
not one, but two penitentiaries...

534
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:12,391
...are considered a bit a flight risk.

535
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:15,360
We need to know where you are
and what you're doing at all times.

536
00:44:15,532 --> 00:44:19,161
These are GPS ankle monitors.
Now, step up, take one and put it on.

537
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:21,060
I ain't wearing that.

538
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:23,466
Let's make this clear.

539
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,872
I'm your ally. But more importantly,
I'm your boss, which means if this fails...

540
00:44:28,044 --> 00:44:31,138
...it's my ass on the line as much,
if not more, than yours.

541
00:44:31,314 --> 00:44:34,715
So from this point on,
if I ask you to do something, you do it.

542
00:44:34,885 --> 00:44:37,183
If I ask you to say something, you say it.

543
00:44:37,354 --> 00:44:40,687
And if I ask you to put on a monitor,
you put on a monitor.

544
00:45:00,777 --> 00:45:03,177
As far as the general public
is concerned...

545
00:45:03,346 --> 00:45:07,009
...you're being detained in a supermax
facility somewhere in the United States.

546
00:45:07,183 --> 00:45:11,119
So to avoid any messy explanations
and stay off the Company's radar...

547
00:45:11,288 --> 00:45:14,724
...you need to keep your heads down
and your ears open.

548
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,753
You'll be provided cell phones,
clothing and toiletries.

549
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:20,726
All the basic necessities
to get you up and running.

550
00:45:20,897 --> 00:45:23,161
You patted these guys down
before you let them in?

551
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:26,131
- I can't be getting shanked or shivved...
- Who's this?

552
00:45:26,303 --> 00:45:28,737
This is Roland Glenn.
He'll be assisting you.

553
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:32,432
- We've already got our team.
- No, Scofield, see, this is my team.

554
00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:35,305
And Roland's working off a sentence
like the rest of you.

555
00:45:35,478 --> 00:45:37,776
With the amount of security
around Scylla...

556
00:45:37,948 --> 00:45:39,916
...Roland's expertise will be a necessity.

557
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:43,484
So if there's no more questions,
let's get to work on finding Scylla.

558
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:45,553
What about that second step,
the break-in?

559
00:45:45,722 --> 00:45:48,850
You let me worry about step two.
You worry about finding Scylla.

560
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:51,459
I've got an idea where to start.

561
00:45:51,828 --> 00:45:55,229
That's excellent, Alexander.
See? There's a man who's thinking.

562
00:45:55,398 --> 00:45:57,992
All right, let's let these men get to work.

563
00:45:58,635 --> 00:46:01,661
Good luck. To all of us.

564
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:04,673
Yeah, since I was here first...

565
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:08,277
...I think I'll just go ahead
and grab that SS bedroom, if that's cool.

566
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:10,544
- Sara.
- Yeah?

567
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:12,511
You take the boat.

568
00:46:15,518 --> 00:46:20,114
You know, when this is all done,
you and me, we're gonna settle up.

569
00:46:26,229 --> 00:46:29,790
All right, obviously there's a lot of history
in this room.

570
00:46:29,966 --> 00:46:31,194
That's a given.

571
00:46:31,368 --> 00:46:34,235
But if we're gonna pull this off,
it's gonna take all of us.

572
00:46:34,404 --> 00:46:35,496
We gotta work together.

573
00:46:35,672 --> 00:46:37,833
So if anyone has a problem,
get it out now.

574
00:46:38,274 --> 00:46:42,506
If you wanna clear the air with someone,
now's the time.

575
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:53,680
All right. Let's get to work.

576
00:46:54,224 --> 00:47:00,185
Whistler's assignment was to drop off this
data card, Scylla, to a Company executive...

577
00:47:00,363 --> 00:47:02,456
...someone he referred to
as The Cardholder...

578
00:47:02,632 --> 00:47:07,001
...and his job was to protect it,
to keep it safe.

579
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:11,770
Now, I didn't see who he was,
but I got a look at his driver.

580
00:47:11,941 --> 00:47:14,671
His driver?
You wanna sketch this guy's face...

581
00:47:14,844 --> 00:47:18,075
...and match it up to 10 million people
in Los Angeles? That's great.

582
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:20,273
I saw more than just the guy's face.

583
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:22,714
All the drivers were hanging around,
talking shop.

584
00:47:22,886 --> 00:47:26,982
But this guy, he was standing by himself,
legs apart, hands behind his back at rest.

585
00:47:27,157 --> 00:47:31,059
He's former military. His car
rides a little lower than the rest of them.

586
00:47:31,227 --> 00:47:35,721
Probably signifies private security,
weighed down by bulletproof siding.

587
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:39,426
His suit... His suit... You don't buy
a suit like that on a cop's salary...

588
00:47:39,602 --> 00:47:41,627
...or pulling weekend gigs as a driver.

589
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:44,267
That means he's full-time
and he's highly paid.

590
00:47:45,108 --> 00:47:47,941
You ask our friend, Mr. Self,
to run tax records...

591
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:52,974
...of 45 to 55-year-old white males
in Los Angeles drawing a military pension...

592
00:47:53,149 --> 00:47:56,050
...and taking six figures
from a private security company...

593
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:59,745
...and you narrow your field
from 10 million to about 50...

594
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:02,551
...and then I can pick the guy out
from there.

595
00:48:04,861 --> 00:48:06,761
Find the driver, you find the Cardholder.

596
00:48:26,983 --> 00:48:29,884
We haven't ate or drank anything
for days.

597
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:33,985
- I don't wanna die out here.
- We ain't gonna die, Sancho.

598
00:48:34,157 --> 00:48:36,057
Hey. Hey, hey.

599
00:48:36,226 --> 00:48:37,989
- We ain't gonna die.
- Okay.

600
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:40,595
We just gotta find what's called
a compass cactus...

601
00:48:40,763 --> 00:48:42,822
...due to the fact
it leans toward the south.

602
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:45,524
Inside's a delicious fruit
which will fill our bellies.

603
00:48:45,702 --> 00:48:50,571
Plus, we find out which way is south,
we're gonna find out which way is north.

604
00:48:54,477 --> 00:48:55,944
Tell you what.

605
00:48:56,479 --> 00:49:01,348
Why don't we rest here for a while, huh?
We'll travel at night when it's cooler.

606
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:03,751
That sounds good.

607
00:49:06,456 --> 00:49:08,617
What are we gonna do
when we get there?

608
00:49:08,892 --> 00:49:10,120
To San Diego?

609
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:14,857
You mean after Michael pays
for the vile he's transgressed upon me?

610
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:20,496
I'm still trying to figure that out.

611
00:50:26,669 --> 00:50:28,193
Nice to work with Homeland.

612
00:50:28,905 --> 00:50:31,465
The FBI would take days
to gather this intel.

613
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:35,600
FBI should have hired me. I could've gotten
whatever info you want in 25 minutes.

614
00:50:35,778 --> 00:50:36,972
You some kind of hacker?

615
00:50:37,146 --> 00:50:39,410
I design silicon lithography
for personal gain.

616
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:42,142
- He's an identity thief.
- He's a douche.

617
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:45,913
Hey, why don't you sit in the corner
and we'll get you when we need you.

618
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:49,991
This is him. That's the driver.

619
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:53,963
- Now what?
- Well, he takes us to the Cardholder.

620
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,598
And the Cardholder takes us to Scylla.

621
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:06,407
You could have left me there, in jail.

622
00:51:06,576 --> 00:51:07,941
Could have or should have?

623
00:51:08,444 --> 00:51:11,106
- Maybe both.
- Are you thanking me, Alex?

624
00:51:11,281 --> 00:51:12,680
- I don't know.
- Don't bother.

625
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:15,716
You're here because we needed you,
not because we wanted you.

626
00:51:15,885 --> 00:51:17,477
That's him.

627
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,447
That's the guy.

628
00:51:28,898 --> 00:51:31,992
- Whoa, what's that?
- Looks like private security.

629
00:51:35,605 --> 00:51:37,766
This thing is a fortress.

630
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:41,133
All right, slow down, slow down.

631
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:44,178
This thing we gotta get, it's in there?

632
00:51:46,482 --> 00:51:50,942
They got motion sensors, alarm systems,
armed guards.

633
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:56,082
In and out of that place
without anybody knowing.

634
00:51:56,893 --> 00:51:58,884
You better have one hell of a plan,
Michael.

635
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:03,589
So there's no freaking way
to break into the place.

636
00:52:03,766 --> 00:52:06,735
- Not quickly. Not without being seen.
- What about the neighbors?

637
00:52:06,903 --> 00:52:09,872
Somewhere we can be staged from.
You know, go under and up.

638
00:52:10,373 --> 00:52:13,536
Closest neighbor is here,
across the street.

639
00:52:14,143 --> 00:52:15,906
And even that would take weeks.

640
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,175
The government's story about us being held
in the supermax will only last so long.

641
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:23,683
What does that mean? I mean,
then what if somebody finds out we're not?

642
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:27,550
What if we don't have to be in the house?
If the card is so important...

643
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:29,191
...maybe the guy's carrying it.

644
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,987
According to records,
the owner is Stuart Tuxhorn...

645
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:35,653
...and he's the CEO of a company
called Spectroleum.

646
00:52:35,832 --> 00:52:38,164
Heavy hitter like that
is gonna have security 24/7.

647
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:40,666
We gotta get this
without anyone knowing it's gone.

648
00:52:40,837 --> 00:52:45,536
- Lf he's got it on him, how do we get it off?
- You don't steal the card, you copy it.

649
00:52:51,514 --> 00:52:54,506
Oh, now you're interested
in what I gotta say, right?

650
00:52:55,685 --> 00:52:57,414
Copying it will make it harder.

651
00:52:57,587 --> 00:53:00,556
Not only do you have to steal it,
you have to return it, genius.

652
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:03,715
Only if you don't got me, hombre.

653
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:08,387
- What's that?
- This is the reason I got busted.

654
00:53:08,564 --> 00:53:10,623
- Oh, you stole a cell phone?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

655
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,395
No, I'm looking at federal time
because I stole a cell phone. Seriously.

656
00:53:15,471 --> 00:53:17,939
I invented this
so that I don't have to steal.

657
00:53:19,008 --> 00:53:22,375
It looks like a cell phone,
but it's really like a digital black hole.

658
00:53:22,545 --> 00:53:26,037
Wireless hard drive that swallows up
any electronic data within 10 feet.

659
00:53:26,215 --> 00:53:27,978
- Like what?
- Like the account info...

660
00:53:28,151 --> 00:53:31,211
...of anyone at Starbucks
with a latte and a laptop.

661
00:53:31,387 --> 00:53:34,049
Like the PIN number of any credit card
used at a gas pump.

662
00:53:34,223 --> 00:53:37,420
I can get the identities
and financial statements of 10 people...

663
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:40,460
...in 10 minutes on a slow day
with one hand on my junk.

664
00:53:42,231 --> 00:53:46,759
- And the information imbedded in Scylla?
- Lf we can get close enough...

665
00:53:47,904 --> 00:53:49,098
...it's ours.

666
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:07,315
Is this number...

667
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:10,785
...acceptable to you?

668
00:54:13,896 --> 00:54:15,523
Ten thousand people?

669
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:27,309
- Yes.
- Good.

670
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:31,441
Now that you're on board,
we can issue the op order today.

671
00:54:41,357 --> 00:54:42,449
He's on his way.

672
00:54:43,759 --> 00:54:45,556
All right, hold on.

673
00:54:47,797 --> 00:54:50,493
<i>- Sara, it's me.
- Everybody's on.</i>

674
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:52,156
Okay.

675
00:54:52,335 --> 00:54:55,702
While I'm monitoring the device,
I'm not gonna see what's being copied.

676
00:54:55,872 --> 00:54:58,340
But like downloading quality porn
from the Internet...

677
00:54:58,508 --> 00:55:01,204
...a progress bar's gonna tell me
when it's time to rock.

678
00:55:01,377 --> 00:55:05,643
- How long do they need to stay in range?
- Encrypted data is gonna take two minutes.

679
00:55:06,282 --> 00:55:09,012
- Here he comes.
- Sucre, you're on.

680
00:55:21,564 --> 00:55:23,088
Good luck.

681
00:55:26,903 --> 00:55:28,564
Easy, easy.

682
00:55:30,106 --> 00:55:32,700
Sir, would you mind stepping
away from the vehicle?

683
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:35,600
- Talk to me, Roland.
- I got nothing, man.

684
00:55:35,978 --> 00:55:38,913
Last time I had this I was dry-humping
my way through 5th grade.

685
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:41,015
Calm down.

686
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:45,878
Sir, would you mind?
Sir, step away from the vehicle.

687
00:55:46,055 --> 00:55:48,615
It's okay. Just relax.
We don't have to get all excited.

688
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:51,385
- So you speak English now?
- Only a little, but...

689
00:55:52,895 --> 00:55:54,590
- How about now?
- Nada.

690
00:55:54,764 --> 00:55:58,632
- Try to get closer to him.
- Lf he was any closer, he'd be in the car.

691
00:56:00,369 --> 00:56:01,996
I get your little act, Pedro.

692
00:56:02,171 --> 00:56:06,267
Hit the brakes, let the rich guy
pay for damage you don't intend to fix.

693
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:12,308
Just give the man some money
so we can leave.

694
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:18,143
Congratulations.

695
00:56:26,028 --> 00:56:28,087
He was there.
I think Tuxhorn was in the car.

696
00:56:28,264 --> 00:56:31,324
<i>- So did we get it or not?
- Nope. Nothing.</i>

697
00:56:44,246 --> 00:56:45,804
Can I help you?

698
00:56:48,284 --> 00:56:51,845
- So how did you find me?
- I never lost you.

699
00:56:52,922 --> 00:56:54,651
The new nose threw me a bit, but...

700
00:56:54,824 --> 00:56:57,156
What do you want, Don? I got customers.

701
00:56:57,326 --> 00:57:00,352
Look, back in the days,
when you worked with the Company...

702
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:03,396
For the Company.
I did economic forecasts of their operations.

703
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:05,693
- I wasn't one of the guy...
- But you had access.

704
00:57:05,868 --> 00:57:08,803
The last time I helped you,
the only thing I got out of it...

705
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:11,769
...was plastic surgery
and a hundred-thousand-dollar pay cut.

706
00:57:11,941 --> 00:57:15,035
You buy one of these family cars
with above-average gas mileage...

707
00:57:15,211 --> 00:57:17,008
...or you leave me the hell alone.

708
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:18,203
I know about Scylla.

709
00:57:20,483 --> 00:57:21,541
And I'm going after it.

710
00:57:23,653 --> 00:57:26,554
You know, I knew you were crazy.
I didn't know you were stupid.

711
00:57:26,722 --> 00:57:29,213
Well, let's just say
I was able to get my hands on it.

712
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:33,260
It's my understanding Scylla can only
be used if it's plugged into a decoder box...

713
00:57:33,429 --> 00:57:35,693
...that's hidden in one of the Company
facilities.

714
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:39,961
- You know, I wish I could help, but I can't.
- No, you are helping, Jasper.

715
00:57:40,136 --> 00:57:43,162
It's a matter of whether you do it
before or after I shame you...

716
00:57:43,339 --> 00:57:45,705
...in front of your coworkers here.

717
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,910
Tell me where the Company
keeps the box.

718
00:57:52,314 --> 00:57:55,647
- Could be anywhere. I don't know.
- Somebody does, right?

719
00:57:55,818 --> 00:57:57,649
Somebody that you might have access to.

720
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:01,017
If you go down this road,
your government job won't protect you.

721
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:03,624
Then I better not get caught, right?

722
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,458
If I don't find something to eat soon,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

723
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:09,859
I'm not gonna make it.

724
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,794
We just gotta keep...
Gotta keep talking, Sancho.

725
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:18,099
Keep our brains focused on something other
than our empty bellies and our dry mouths.

726
00:58:18,274 --> 00:58:21,334
Okay? Come on, now.
Let's start with your...

727
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:22,534
Your favorite color.

728
00:58:29,785 --> 00:58:31,719
Hell are you doing?

729
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:34,352
I'm hungry, Teddy.
Why should both of us die...

730
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:36,923
...when one of us
can help the other one survive?

731
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:39,391
You don't wanna do this. Please.

732
00:58:39,562 --> 00:58:41,553
I'll make it quick. I promise.

733
00:58:45,668 --> 00:58:47,192
Sancho?

734
00:58:53,476 --> 00:58:54,568
Sancho.

735
00:58:55,578 --> 00:58:58,240
Why'd you have to go
and do something so s?

736
00:59:36,185 --> 00:59:39,985
So if Tuxhorn doesn't have the card on him,
it's gotta be in there, right?

737
00:59:42,191 --> 00:59:45,456
Look, there's no way we're getting
in that house without being seen.

738
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:46,985
I know.

739
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:49,222
If the card's in there,
how we gonna copy it?

740
00:59:49,398 --> 00:59:52,925
We're not. She's gonna do it for us.

741
01:00:04,113 --> 01:00:06,877
- Hey.
- Hi.

742
01:00:08,384 --> 01:00:10,318
What you reading?

743
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:14,155
<i>There is no fighting her
No power can fight her.</i>

744
01:00:14,323 --> 01:00:16,621
<i>All that avails is flight.</i>

745
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:20,385
<i>That's Homer. It's from The Odyssey.</i>

746
01:00:20,563 --> 01:00:22,394
- Is this from my father's folder?
- Yeah.

747
01:00:22,565 --> 01:00:25,432
And it explains why Scylla
sounded so familiar.

748
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:27,831
If I'm not mistaken,
it's from that chapter...

749
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,836
...where Odysseus is told
he has to confront a monster...

750
01:00:31,907 --> 01:00:33,306
...known as Scylla.

751
01:00:33,475 --> 01:00:35,409
I wonder why he wrote this down.

752
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:39,036
I could be wrong,
but I believe Odysseus is told...

753
01:00:39,215 --> 01:00:42,150
...that in order to continue on his path,
to pass Scylla...

754
01:00:42,685 --> 01:00:45,085
...it'll require the sacrifice
of six of his men.

755
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:48,615
His only other alternative
is to abandon his path...

756
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:51,692
...and he chooses to make the sacrifice.

757
01:00:53,128 --> 01:00:55,153
Well, that's a hell of a choice.

758
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,001
One I'm not sure I'm comfortable making.

759
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,337
Sara, about tomorrow. The plan.

760
01:01:08,677 --> 01:01:10,440
The housekeeper.

761
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,442
- Lf you're not up to it...
- Yeah. No, I am.

762
01:01:25,928 --> 01:01:31,594
Tell me, is Claudia Mauricio
a good roommate?

763
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:40,265
A good person?

764
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,380
I hope she feels the same about you.

765
01:01:52,554 --> 01:01:55,717
Shelby,
you wouldn't believe the traffic on...

766
01:01:57,326 --> 01:02:00,454
You'll want to be quiet now, Claudia.

767
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:03,655
There are levels of clearance
at the Department of Corrections...

768
01:02:03,832 --> 01:02:08,269
...that are simply not available,
even for friends as connected as mine.

769
01:02:09,338 --> 01:02:11,397
So listen carefully.

770
01:02:11,907 --> 01:02:15,638
If you even remotely value
your friend's life...

771
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,140
...you're going to use your security code to
access the records for prisoner transfers...

772
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:26,812
...and tell me where they sent
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows.

773
01:02:58,854 --> 01:03:00,583
- Can I take that for you?
- Thanks.

774
01:03:00,756 --> 01:03:02,018
Sure.

775
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:07,956
That's a great bag.
You mind if I ask you where you got it?

776
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:11,031
It was a gift from my boss,
so I don't really know. Sorry.

777
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,135
- Sure. Here you go.
- Thanks.

778
01:03:14,303 --> 01:03:16,168
I can never find a good bag.

779
01:03:16,338 --> 01:03:20,331
I'm a teacher and I have books
and grading materials...

780
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:24,502
...and I should probably go ahead and
just invest in a wagon one of these days.

781
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,047
That's why I love this bag.
It has so many pockets.

782
01:03:28,884 --> 01:03:31,785
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- Oh, no.

783
01:03:31,954 --> 01:03:32,978
Thanks.

784
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,438
Oh, thank God, thank God, I hope.

785
01:03:57,913 --> 01:03:59,813
- You all right, mister?
- Yeah.

786
01:03:59,982 --> 01:04:04,510
My damn truck blew a gasket a few miles
back. I've been hoofing it ever since.

787
01:04:04,686 --> 01:04:05,710
Where you headed?

788
01:04:06,588 --> 01:04:07,885
San Diego.

789
01:04:09,058 --> 01:04:11,549
Hell, we can give you a ride,
if you'd like.

790
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,360
Hey, what's wrong, man?
Eat some bad Mexican?

791
01:04:16,331 --> 01:04:18,356
Something like that.

792
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:26,573
Same as yesterday, right on schedule.

793
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:35,573
She better have that thing in her purse.

794
01:04:41,824 --> 01:04:44,486
- Tuxhorn residence.
- Hello, I'm from the alarm company.

795
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:48,323
We've been receiving some strange signals
from your property.

796
01:04:48,497 --> 01:04:52,627
We'd like you to check the windows
to make sure all the contacts are still active.

797
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:55,133
- All the windows?
- Yes, ma'am.

798
01:04:55,304 --> 01:04:57,898
Every room in the house.

799
01:04:58,774 --> 01:05:00,639
Okay, hold on.

800
01:05:05,848 --> 01:05:08,442
- She still have the bag?
- Yeah.

801
01:05:14,089 --> 01:05:17,422
She's got it. I'm picking up all kinds of gak
from the house, man.

802
01:05:17,593 --> 01:05:20,027
Small stuff. Maybe a digital camera,
an MP3 player.

803
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:22,629
Nothing of the size
of what we're looking for though.

804
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:24,789
- Keep her moving.
- So far, so good, ma'am.

805
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:27,162
Please move on to the next room.

806
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:32,235
How we doing?

807
01:05:32,608 --> 01:05:33,632
Still don't got it.

808
01:05:37,412 --> 01:05:39,846
If the card's in there,
it'd be in some kind of safe.

809
01:05:40,382 --> 01:05:41,406
Office.

810
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:44,711
Our system is showing that the malfunction
is coming from a room...

811
01:05:44,887 --> 01:05:47,685
...that's designated as an office or a den.

812
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:50,552
The library?
Mister doesn't like me going in there.

813
01:05:50,726 --> 01:05:54,890
He'd like it even less if you went home
without properly setting the alarm first.

814
01:05:56,565 --> 01:05:58,499
All right, I'll check.

815
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:05,473
- We got something.
- The card?

816
01:06:06,241 --> 01:06:08,334
Yeah. Files so big,
it can't be anything else.

817
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,808
Keep her there for two minutes
while it finishes.

818
01:06:10,979 --> 01:06:14,210
- Stall her. We need two minutes.
- Ma'am, I think we found our problem.

819
01:06:14,383 --> 01:06:17,079
If you could stay at that window
and hold it closed...

820
01:06:17,252 --> 01:06:20,278
...while we reset the system,
that should do it.

821
01:06:29,998 --> 01:06:31,056
Talk to me, Roland.

822
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:34,661
It's almost, captain. Almost, almost.
Come on, come on, come on.

823
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:41,540
Come on, come on, come on.

824
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:42,768
Come on.

825
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:49,112
Come on, and... got it.

826
01:06:49,284 --> 01:06:52,344
- Got it.
- All right, ma'am. Thank you for your help.

827
01:06:58,327 --> 01:07:00,693
All we need to do now, man, is just...

828
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:04,922
She's heading back inside.

829
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,590
- What for?
- I don't know.

830
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:11,901
Oh, man.

831
01:07:12,374 --> 01:07:15,468
No, we're good. She's out.

832
01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:33,417
- Hey.
- Hey, stop.

833
01:07:34,296 --> 01:07:35,593
Wait here.

834
01:07:43,238 --> 01:07:45,297
I actually had to slow down
not to catch you.

835
01:07:45,474 --> 01:07:46,964
I think I pulled a groin.

836
01:07:49,411 --> 01:07:51,174
It's not in the bag.

837
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:55,082
- It's not here.
- How?

838
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,810
The device, it's not in there.
Give me it. Give me it.

839
01:07:59,921 --> 01:08:01,889
Son of a bitch.

840
01:08:06,395 --> 01:08:08,260
Twenty-six.

841
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:09,863
Twenty-seven.

842
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:11,192
Twenty-eight.

843
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:36,450
<i>Go ahead.</i>

844
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:39,958
Before Burrows and Scofield
were allegedly transferred to Arlington...

845
01:08:40,128 --> 01:08:41,823
...someone posted their bail.

846
01:08:42,397 --> 01:08:43,591
I need to know who.

847
01:08:43,765 --> 01:08:47,326
<i>I'm showing a Bruce Bennett,
former aide to Governor Frank Tancredi.</i>

848
01:09:03,585 --> 01:09:06,053
- You think it fell out?
- We looked everywhere.

849
01:09:06,221 --> 01:09:09,054
- Do you think we got the thing copied?
- Like I said...

850
01:09:09,224 --> 01:09:12,216
...I can't read the content
without downloading the device.

851
01:09:12,527 --> 01:09:15,724
Unless this Tuxhorn's got like
a 50,000-hour TiVo, I think we got it.

852
01:09:15,897 --> 01:09:19,333
- It doesn't matter if we can't find it.
- Well, where the hell is it?

853
01:09:20,235 --> 01:09:22,567
It's still inside the house.

854
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:26,265
That's why the maid went back.
She must have assumed it belonged...

855
01:09:26,441 --> 01:09:27,931
...to her boss and then left it.

856
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,668
Then guess what. It's game over.

857
01:09:29,845 --> 01:09:32,370
You know how many months it took me
to make that thing?

858
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:36,074
- You think I can whip up another one...
- Losing it is not the problem.

859
01:09:36,251 --> 01:09:38,082
If they find it, that's the problem.

860
01:09:39,121 --> 01:09:42,090
They find out someone was after that card,
we're done.

861
01:09:42,524 --> 01:09:45,118
What does that mean?
We're gonna go back to prison?

862
01:09:45,293 --> 01:09:47,420
- Are they gonna kill us?
- Shut up!

863
01:09:50,132 --> 01:09:52,657
It means we're going in to get it.

864
01:10:00,709 --> 01:10:03,041
If we had a few days,
we could pull this off.

865
01:10:03,211 --> 01:10:06,305
- I gather we don't have that kind of time.
- Yeah, you gather right.

866
01:10:06,481 --> 01:10:10,577
Look, if you want us to get that device,
throw us a bone. Give us some extra help.

867
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:13,243
What you're asking for
requires additional people...

868
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:16,414
...which, given the covert nature
of this operation, I cannot do.

869
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:19,492
- You're asking for the impossible.
- I'm asking for competence.

870
01:10:19,661 --> 01:10:23,427
I'm not the one who put the entire mission
in the hands of a damn maid.

871
01:10:25,901 --> 01:10:30,133
Look, if the Company finds that copy
of Scylla before we do, that's it, Michael.

872
01:10:30,305 --> 01:10:33,934
That's ball game. They're gonna find out
who was behind it and ghost us.

873
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,202
All of us.

874
01:10:36,378 --> 01:10:38,073
Are you okay?

875
01:10:38,914 --> 01:10:40,404
Yeah.

876
01:10:41,983 --> 01:10:43,507
I'm fine.

877
01:10:44,219 --> 01:10:47,347
Look, I didn't choose you to do this
because I had you in custody.

878
01:10:47,522 --> 01:10:50,616
I chose you to do this
because I believe you could pull it off.

879
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:54,819
Yeah, well, a lot of people have believed
in me in the last few months, Agent Self.

880
01:10:54,996 --> 01:10:57,624
Not all of them are alive today.

881
01:10:59,901 --> 01:11:02,597
Can you get me back the device or not?

882
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:08,198
This is what we got.

883
01:11:08,376 --> 01:11:11,140
The housekeeper saw the device
as she was leaving the house.

884
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:13,873
Then she disappears back inside
for 15 seconds.

885
01:11:14,049 --> 01:11:16,040
So wherever it is, it's close to the door.

886
01:11:16,218 --> 01:11:19,483
So 15 seconds.
That's all we gotta buy ourselves.

887
01:11:19,654 --> 01:11:22,248
I'm not sure how close we're gonna
get to this house...

888
01:11:22,424 --> 01:11:24,892
...let alone inside of it,
but let's say that we do.

889
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,291
The alarm they got installed in this house
is triggered 1.2 seconds...

890
01:11:28,463 --> 01:11:30,556
...after broken contact
in any door or window.

891
01:11:30,732 --> 01:11:35,226
Which would send the security guards
with their 47 guns rushing into the property.

892
01:11:35,403 --> 01:11:38,895
After 30 seconds, the alarm company
will dispatch vehicles, three to four...

893
01:11:39,074 --> 01:11:40,405
...depending on availability.

894
01:11:40,575 --> 01:11:43,373
After confirmation of a break-in
they'll dispatch vehicles...

895
01:11:43,545 --> 01:11:45,740
...to seal off any exits from the property.

896
01:11:45,914 --> 01:11:47,006
I don't know about this.

897
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:49,810
It's clear why they hired
a bunch of cons to do this job.

898
01:11:49,985 --> 01:11:53,216
It's not because they wanted it
off the books. We're expendable.

899
01:11:53,388 --> 01:11:56,585
Who's gonna care if a bunch of crooks
wind up dead?

900
01:11:56,758 --> 01:11:57,816
It's suicide.

901
01:11:57,993 --> 01:12:00,393
I'm gonna keep looking
and see what I can find.

902
01:12:05,267 --> 01:12:07,030
<i>That quote from The Odyssey.</i>

903
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:11,036
- What about it?
- I just can't shake that line.

904
01:12:11,773 --> 01:12:13,365
All that avails is flight.

905
01:12:15,076 --> 01:12:17,636
What if flight is our only option, Linc?

906
01:12:19,514 --> 01:12:23,041
What if our father, after everything
he discovered about the Company...

907
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,584
What if that's what he finally realized?

908
01:12:26,988 --> 01:12:31,049
You know, the one thing I remember most
about Dad was the back of his head.

909
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:35,526
Always walking out the front door.
Always running from something.

910
01:12:35,697 --> 01:12:37,756
Mom, us, himself.

911
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,668
But the one thing
he never ran away from...

912
01:12:40,835 --> 01:12:43,804
...was his belief that the Company
needed to be taken down.

913
01:12:43,972 --> 01:12:47,965
- And we got an opportunity to do that.
- Then this is our fight, not theirs.

914
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,511
Man, this ain't Fox River.

915
01:12:51,713 --> 01:12:53,613
These guys chose to be here.

916
01:12:54,149 --> 01:12:55,810
Remember that.

917
01:12:56,451 --> 01:12:58,146
They got a choice.

918
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:40,514
- Almost.
- Ready?

919
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:45,717
Go.

920
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:56,026
- What is it?
- Check around back.

921
01:15:05,146 --> 01:15:06,943
The side door is locked.

922
01:15:07,115 --> 01:15:08,514
Go.

923
01:15:12,587 --> 01:15:16,455
On our way now.
This Team 2 moving into position now.

924
01:15:16,758 --> 01:15:17,782
Let's go.

925
01:15:22,997 --> 01:15:25,056
- Where's it coming from?
- Across the street.

926
01:15:31,005 --> 01:15:32,666
Okay, come on.

927
01:15:45,053 --> 01:15:46,486
Go.

928
01:15:57,499 --> 01:16:01,230
Just something across the street.
We got a team checking it out now.

929
01:16:01,402 --> 01:16:03,700
You can go back inside, sir.

930
01:16:15,116 --> 01:16:16,344
They must be out of town.

931
01:16:21,356 --> 01:16:22,948
Yes.

932
01:16:24,692 --> 01:16:27,661
Daddy, is everything okay?

933
01:16:37,405 --> 01:16:39,100
Alex.

934
01:16:39,774 --> 01:16:41,298
Thanks, Jim.

935
01:16:41,843 --> 01:16:43,310
Alex.

936
01:16:43,478 --> 01:16:44,945
Let's go.

937
01:17:16,811 --> 01:17:17,835
Go.

938
01:17:27,755 --> 01:17:29,655
Don't turn around.

939
01:17:29,824 --> 01:17:33,089
Unless you'd like to experience
a great deal of pain...

940
01:17:33,261 --> 01:17:35,229
...over an even greater length of time.

941
01:17:36,564 --> 01:17:38,532
You know,
just take whatever you want here.

942
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:44,161
The only thing I want from you, Bruce,
is the answer to a simple question.

943
01:17:44,339 --> 01:17:46,739
Where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows?

944
01:17:46,908 --> 01:17:48,842
I only know what I read in the papers.

945
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:52,002
Three days ago,
there were a hundred and five inmates...

946
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:57,049
...in the supermax wing of the
U.S. Penitentiary in Livingston, Texas...

947
01:17:57,218 --> 01:17:59,880
...where the brothers were allegedly sent.

948
01:18:00,054 --> 01:18:02,887
There are still 105 inmates there...

949
01:18:03,057 --> 01:18:05,992
...and no one has been released
during that time.

950
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:09,960
Someone is playing a shell game, Bruce.

951
01:18:10,131 --> 01:18:12,827
I'm just trying to find out who.

952
01:18:13,534 --> 01:18:17,971
- I have no criminal jurisdiction over...
- I know you bailed them out.

953
01:18:18,406 --> 01:18:20,874
I know you've been in contact
with Sara Tancredi.

954
01:18:21,042 --> 01:18:25,502
I swear to you,
I have no idea where they are.

955
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:29,810
I guess we'll see about that.

956
01:18:35,823 --> 01:18:37,552
Good luck, Teddy.

957
01:18:37,725 --> 01:18:40,558
Who needs luck when you got friends
like you fellas, huh?

958
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:46,029
Hey, you mind if I take this old newspaper
of yours with me?

959
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,464
No problem.
Sorry to hear about your friend, dude.

960
01:18:49,604 --> 01:18:50,628
It's all right.

961
01:18:52,407 --> 01:18:53,601
He had a full life.

962
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:57,207
Later, Teddy.

963
01:19:12,026 --> 01:19:13,891
There you go.

964
01:19:31,412 --> 01:19:32,674
Thirty-six.

965
01:19:34,015 --> 01:19:37,678
Twenty-four. Thirty-six.

966
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:02,740
<i>PCL 71, San Diego to Los Angeles,
boarding now.</i>

967
01:20:20,094 --> 01:20:23,427
- Did you get it?
- Let's make sure we got what we wanted.

968
01:20:26,434 --> 01:20:28,061
- Linc.
- Yeah.

969
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,398
- Don't let that thing out of your sight.
- All right.

970
01:20:33,374 --> 01:20:34,398
We're halfway there.

971
01:20:34,575 --> 01:20:37,738
All we gotta do is that little B and E
and... we're out of here.

972
01:20:37,912 --> 01:20:40,904
I need to get a hold of Self,
see when we can get started.

973
01:20:41,082 --> 01:20:43,346
So, what are you gonna do
when all this is over?

974
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,849
That's a good question.

975
01:20:51,059 --> 01:20:54,961
Brother, whatever this Scylla thing,
it is a monster of a code.

976
01:20:57,131 --> 01:20:58,598
Wait a second.

977
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:00,631
No.

978
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:03,767
No.

979
01:21:13,448 --> 01:21:15,040
Sara...

980
01:21:15,216 --> 01:21:18,310
...I was gonna come down here
and ask you if you wanted to talk...

981
01:21:18,486 --> 01:21:21,717
...about what happened in Panama...

982
01:21:22,657 --> 01:21:25,057
...but I think I already know
what you're gonna say.

983
01:21:25,226 --> 01:21:26,250
How's that?

984
01:21:26,694 --> 01:21:28,787
Because you're a little like me.

985
01:21:29,564 --> 01:21:32,829
Because you're gonna say you're fine,
that you can handle it.

986
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:38,232
So I'll just leave it at this.

987
01:21:38,773 --> 01:21:40,331
I'm here.

988
01:21:41,342 --> 01:21:42,969
Whenever you wanna talk...

989
01:21:43,678 --> 01:21:45,236
...l'm here.

990
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:47,611
Thank you.

991
01:21:53,187 --> 01:21:55,246
You know that the only thing...

992
01:21:55,423 --> 01:21:59,189
...that kept me alive when I was being held
was the thought of being with you.

993
01:22:01,529 --> 01:22:04,521
Also if anything happened to me,
you were gonna blame yourself...

994
01:22:04,699 --> 01:22:08,362
...and you would spend the rest of your life
punishing yourself for it.

995
01:22:08,536 --> 01:22:11,300
And I can't bear the thought of that.

996
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:18,579
So can we make a deal right now
that we're even...

997
01:22:18,746 --> 01:22:24,616
...and just wipe the slate clean,
and no guilt and no responsibility?

998
01:22:25,019 --> 01:22:28,978
If we're gonna be together, I don't want it
to be out of a sense of obligation.

999
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:34,789
Or even that we should be
because of what we've been through.

1000
01:22:35,696 --> 01:22:37,630
I just wanna start over.

1001
01:22:38,733 --> 01:22:40,564
Start over.

1002
01:22:41,469 --> 01:22:42,493
Okay.

1003
01:22:44,605 --> 01:22:46,664
But does that mean
I have to divorce my wife?

1004
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:52,010
Because you're still married
to a Russian stripper.

1005
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:56,913
Well, A, I've been a little busy,
and, B, I'm pretty sure she was Czech.

1006
01:22:57,084 --> 01:22:58,449
Michael.

1007
01:22:59,987 --> 01:23:01,011
What's wrong?

1008
01:23:01,689 --> 01:23:03,179
Whatever it is, it ain't it.

1009
01:23:03,357 --> 01:23:05,655
I don't understand.
You said we copied the card.

1010
01:23:05,826 --> 01:23:08,351
Well, we did,
but according to the encryption code...

1011
01:23:09,564 --> 01:23:13,091
Okay, how do I make this clear?
If Scylla was like a pizza...

1012
01:23:13,267 --> 01:23:14,700
...all we got's a slice.

1013
01:23:15,269 --> 01:23:19,205
- So where's the rest of the data?
- I don't know. I don't know. I mean...

1014
01:23:19,774 --> 01:23:22,937
I don't know how we didn't
see this coming. It makes perfect sense.

1015
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:26,773
It's like nuclear launch codes. You don't
give all information to one person.

1016
01:23:26,948 --> 01:23:30,179
- How many do you give it to?
- Okay, that quote your father held onto.

1017
01:23:30,585 --> 01:23:32,246
Scylla is a six-headed monster...

1018
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:35,514
...that requires a sacrifice of six soldiers
in order to pass.

1019
01:23:36,457 --> 01:23:38,220
So Scylla isn't one card.

1020
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,523
It's six.

1021
01:23:48,502 --> 01:23:51,096
What does that mean?
How are we gonna find five more?

1022
01:23:51,272 --> 01:23:52,705
Michael? Michael?

1023
01:24:01,515 --> 01:24:04,541
I'm busy. I don't care what she looks like.

1024
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:06,414
Three tablespoons of water...

1025
01:24:07,054 --> 01:24:09,386
...one of honey. Nothing more.

1026
01:24:11,792 --> 01:24:17,230
If she knows something about anything
that's going on, I'm going to find it.

1027
01:24:21,802 --> 01:24:23,497
Rise and shine, bitch.

1028
01:24:24,005 --> 01:24:25,870
Breakfast.

1029
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:04,137
Michael?

1030
01:25:06,914 --> 01:25:10,850
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1031
01:25:11,352 --> 01:25:14,378
All this security makes you wonder
what the Company's hiding.

1032
01:25:14,555 --> 01:25:17,490
The only way to know for sure
is to find those five other cards.

1033
01:25:17,658 --> 01:25:20,991
- See for ourselves.
- Think we'll have enough time?

1034
01:25:21,162 --> 01:25:22,459
Yeah.

1035
01:25:25,466 --> 01:25:26,728
We'll be fine.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
