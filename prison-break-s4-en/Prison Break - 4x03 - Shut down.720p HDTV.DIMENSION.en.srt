3
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,440
Previously on Prison Break

4
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,530
I'm giving you an opportunity
to avoid 15 years in jail.

5
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,860
In exchange for...?

6
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:07,820
Scylla.

7
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,380
Theses are gps ankle monitors.

8
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,570
I am your boss.

9
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,370
And if I ask you to put on a monitor

10
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,490
you put on a monitor.

11
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,880
This data card-- th-this
'scylla' to a Company executive.

12
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,070
And his job was to-to protect it.

13
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,740
When this is all Done.

14
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,270
you and me, we're gonna settle up.

15
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,750
I'm looking for Alex.

16
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:25,960
Mum.

17
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,990
We're Done talking...

18
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,590
hey! you Don't want to go in there.

19
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,160
You Don't want to go in there.

20
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,970
where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows

21
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,310
I swear to you, i-i have
no idea where they are.

22
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,560
What's wrong?

23
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,240
Whatever it is, it ain't it.

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,090
If-if Scylla was like a pizza,

25
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,050
all we got's a slice.

26
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,060
So Scylla isn't one card,

27
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,610
it's six.

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,030
Hey!

29
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,190
What'd you pull us into? Excuse me?

30
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,920
You figured you'd get us on the hook,

31
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,490
So we could find out for ourselves

32
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,120
How screwed this whole thing was!

33
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,950
What the hell exactly
are you talking about?

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,320
The card, agent Self! I'm
talking about the card!

35
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,910
It's useless! Wait, wait, hold on.

36
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,330
You already got the card?

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,040
Yes, but without the other
five cards, it means nothing!

38
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,320
And I can only assume you knew that!

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,940
What other five?

40
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,200
Don't.

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,400
What other five?

42
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,580
Roland downloaded the card.

43
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,520
There's no Company data on the card.

44
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,100
Without the other five
cards, it's unreadable.

45
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,870
It's like one-sixth of the puzzle,

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,130
But that's not my problem,

47
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,990
Because we had a deal, and we gave you

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,190
Exactly what you asked for.
No, you didn't! No, you didn't!

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,840
We had a deal for you to get me Scylla,

50
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,240
And you haven't gotten
me that, have you?

51
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,400
You gave me your word.

52
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,990
And I'm giving you my
word again-- you will go

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,370
Back to prison if you can't
get me those other five cards.

54
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,400
But if you're telling me
you can't get this Done,

55
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,810
Just let me know right now,
and we'll get your cell ready.

56
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,750
I'll get it Done.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,980
There's one more thing.

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,500
So what'd he say?

59
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,400
We got to find the other
cards. Screw that, man.

60
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,790
We got the card. Let's
do the second step,

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,430
The break-in thing, and end all this.

62
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,650
It doesn't work that way now.

63
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,930
It's not fair. We did what
he said. Then call agent Self,

64
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,670
Tell him you want to
go back to Fox River.

65
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,340
Hell, we're all going to prison

66
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,660
If we can't find the other cards.

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,190
When the government gets scared,

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,360
They tend to cut the cord.

69
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,360
Did Self talk about shutting us down?

70
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,850
Let's just concentrate on
finding Scylla, all right?

71
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,140
Alex.

72
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,550
Where's he going?

73
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,260
Who cares?

74
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:53,890
How are we gonna find
Scylla? We Don't even know

75
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,810
Where to start.

76
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,790
Where's the rest of the stuff you found?

77
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,010
Still printing it up.

78
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,310
When my device was

79
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,930
In Tuxhorn's house it must've
been left next to his pda.

80
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,480
Sucked up all the data from
it and got e-mails and photos.

81
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,710
You see anything we can use?
No, and let me be crystal clear

82
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,890
I point and click.

83
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,560
That's it, other than
that, I'm off the clock.

84
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,740
Shut up. Wait a minute.

85
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,770
Where's his calendar?

86
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,080
Dr. Feelgood's got it.

87
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,230
Here, um, take a look at this.

88
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,860
This is today's date.

89
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,300
There's absolutely
nothing on it but a star.

90
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,710
Every other date, Tuxhorn has
details for his appointments

91
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,540
And meetings-- who he's
with, when and where.

92
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,240
This is the only thing
with nothing on it.

93
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,700
Must be a reason he's
keeping that secret.

94
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,770
Why are we letting this
Self guy call all the shots?

95
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,320
Maybe we should play some hardball.

96
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,810
No. Either help out or get out.

97
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,120
If you open your mouth,

98
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,270
I expect you to offer up a solution.

99
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,250
Hello?

100
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,440
Do you know who this is?

101
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,720
Yeah.

102
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,290
Where are you being held?

103
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,330
I'm not in prison.

104
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,500
Where are you?

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,510
I can't say.

106
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,540
I need you to get something to me,

107
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,440
In l.A. Alex...

108
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,410
It's nothing dangerous. Please, i-i...

109
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,710
I Don't know how much
more Time I have here.

110
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,920
Look... Don't ask me to do something...

111
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,680
You just need

112
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,950
To reach out to the
residential agency in durango.

113
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,400
Alex, no.

114
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,220
Do you know what they did?

115
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,990
They killed my son.

116
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,110
They killed my boy.

117
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,430
I Don't know what to say.

118
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,070
Just say that you'll help me.

119
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,110
Please?

120
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,340
I just need your help.

121
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,730
I need to find out who did it.

122
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,750
Please.

123
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,790
So listen, I know in Fox River

124
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,330
You had to keep secrets from me.

125
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,540
You Don't now.

126
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,450
What's going on?

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,490
Self said we have
until the end of the day

128
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,160
To find the next cardholder.

129
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,080
Or we all go back to prison.

130
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,750
I know that you bailed
out Scofield and Burrows.

131
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,460
And I know they aren't

132
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,300
In a supermax in texas.

133
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,290
But you know where they are.

134
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
Don't you, Bruce?

135
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,210
You Don't want any more
trouble than you're already in.

136
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm not the one in trouble.

137
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,550
Let me help you relax.

138
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,050
It's a beautiful day.

139
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,010
The sun is shining.

140
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,960
Do you feel that gentle breeze?

141
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,610
It's a great day

142
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,520
For a family picnic.

143
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
Don't you think so, Bruce?

144
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,860
Six cards?

145
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,610
That's not what you sold me, Don.

146
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,480
I realize it's more
than we anticipated...

147
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,040
More than you anticipated!

148
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,560
I already have people questioning me

149
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,670
About the supermax line we're Selling.

150
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,510
This whole thing was a mistake. No!

151
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,010
No, this wasn't a mistake.

152
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,390
Scofield got us a card within 24 hours

153
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,830
Of being dropped in los angeles.

154
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,210
He knows what he's doing.

155
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,770
Look, I'm willing to take

156
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,170
The risk and do my job.

157
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,960
I Don't understand why you aren't.

158
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,620
I've been in homeland security
since before it even had a name!

159
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,590
Since before you even had
a single short and curly...

160
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,200
Then you should know what's
at stake here, director.

161
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,900
We could stop it, but not--
not if you end this now.

162
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,630
I'm calling senator Dallo now.

163
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,820
I will see if he wants
this thing killed or not.

164
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,220
But he follows my recommendations, Don.

165
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,700
"sir, changed your late london arrival,

166
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,750
Now 7/16 at 4:00 p.M."

167
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,030
Today's the 16th,

168
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,000
But there nothing about london
in his calendar, is there?

169
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,200
Not that we've seen, no.

170
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,950
Nothing about travel to
or from the uk at all?

171
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,900
No, nothing.

172
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,540
Now, why would he get an e-mail

173
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,200
About an arrival in london when he has

174
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,170
No business scheduled there?

175
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,690
Probably because the e-mail

176
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,610
Is a code.

177
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,010
Alex, I'm so glad you joined us.

178
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,620
S-c-y-l-l-a.

179
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,970
Scylla, the meeting today
at 4:00 is about Scylla.

180
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,280
I think we can assume that
Tuxhorn did not schedule

181
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,180
A meeting with himself, so that

182
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,830
Is where we're going to
find our next cardholder.

183
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,210
Okay, so 4:00 p.M. Is
our when, we need a where.

184
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,570
If you were having a secret meeting,

185
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,090
You wouldn't send all
the information together.

186
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,770
You'd send the where and the when

187
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,360
Separately as a precaution.

188
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,740
Were any other e-mails sent to Tuxhorn

189
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,040
At the same Time as the london e-mail?

190
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,210
Within a few seconds of the
london mail, two more e-mails

191
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,490
Followed from the same ip
path, but that's when my device

192
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,670
Ran out of hard drive space.
It picked up the ip address,

193
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,270
But not the content.
Trace the ip address

194
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,770
And find out who sent these e-mails.

195
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,890
Oh, look, e-mails get bounced

196
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,110
To routers all over the world

197
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,370
Before they end in your inbox.
Wherever the mail's been,

198
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,630
It leaves a shadow file.

199
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,950
Based on the geography,
I'm guessing these e-mails

200
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,370
Probably squatted at the Anaheim

201
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,000
Server cluster a nanosecond
before reaching Tuxhorn.

202
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,270
So that's where you're going
to find your shadow file.

203
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,340
So get it.

204
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,100
Not every geek with a commodore 64

205
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,700
Can ha into nasa. I mean, these servers

206
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,330
Have more firewalls
than the devil's bedroom.

207
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,070
You want those e-mails, I'm sorry.

208
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,060
It's on a main server in Anaheim.

209
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,360
It is possible to find
those e-mails at that server?

210
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,010
Technologically possible, yeah.

211
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,320
Then we're going to Anaheim.

212
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,380
I want you two to go
to Tuxhorn's workplace.

213
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,260
Stake it out-- if you see
him, tail him, call us.

214
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,720
You think you're just going to walk up

215
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,100
To a main server? You know there's going

216
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,480
To be security, right?
We Don't have a choice.

217
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,840
We have to find that e-mail message.

218
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,230
We can find out where the meeting is.

219
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,290
Find out where the meeting is,
we find our next cardholder.

220
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,330
Got it? We stay out of jail.

221
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,670
Yeah, well, good luck, man.

222
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,710
Actually, you're coming with us.

223
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,730
Guess again. Self told me to sit here

224
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,700
And make with the
clickety-clack on the keyboard.

225
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,550
I'm not going nowhere.

226
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,850
Oh yeah, you are.

227
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,000
Hello?

228
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,600
"instahomes welcomes you home

229
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,790
To your furnished apartment."

230
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,990
Why must you go after this man?

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,080
Where I come from, there's
something called a blood feud.

232
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,960
You're coming back, right?

233
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,540
Michael Scofield left me
for dead one too many Times.

234
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,130
Good news, Bruce.

235
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,060
Your favorite aunt
made it to the picnic.

236
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,440
She brought lemonade.

237
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,180
The little cousins are

238
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,990
Swimming in the pond.

239
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,350
Brothers and sisters are

240
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,160
Playing catch in a lush,

241
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,220
Green field.

242
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,290
Everyone is here.

243
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,470
Well, almost everyone.

244
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,610
Two very important people...

245
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,720
...Are missing.

246
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,870
Where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows?

247
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,890
I Don't know.

248
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,910
That's okay, Bruce.

249
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,650
I'm sure you'll remember soon.

250
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,190
Just enjoy the picnic.

251
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,870
Hi, uh, my name is Stephanie Reed.

252
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,990
I'm here for a job interview
with human resources.

253
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,920
Okay, then.

254
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,710
Sorry, your name's not in the system.

255
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,310
Um, would you look
again under r-e-e-d?

256
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,690
Sure.

257
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,380
You know, she should drop
a few buttons on that shirt.

258
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,980
The guard will give her the e-mails.

259
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,600
Great.

260
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,640
Yes.

261
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,440
You're in Anaheim, Michael?

262
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,030
This is a strange Time to
be taking a trip to disney.

263
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,350
Listen to me, I promise you,
if you're trying to run...

264
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,460
I'm trying to get you

265
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,350
Another card.

266
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,710
From where? Tomorrowland?

267
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,120
From an e-mail on a main router.

268
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,940
We think there's a Scylla
meeting this afternoon at 4:00.

269
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,970
Where? Hopefully that information

270
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,260
Will be on the e-mail.

271
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,310
Michael, we're running out of Time.

272
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,740
Then stop wasting mine.

273
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,080
I got to go, I got to go.

274
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,880
Did you talk to senator Dallo?

275
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,810
Yes, I did, and now
I need to talk to you.

276
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,330
I'm shutting it down.

277
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,270
Sorry, ma'am, I Don't have
you down for any meeting today.

278
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,930
Okay, um... The, uh,
the temp agency said

279
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,620
That they were going
to set the interview.

280
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,410
Again, I'm sorry.

281
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,920
Okay.

282
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,810
It was really hard
to get a sitter today.

283
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,340
Would you be willing just to
call human resources and see

284
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,040
If they'll see me since I'm here?

285
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,560
Sure.

286
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,380
Hey, it's Tim at the front desk.

287
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,010
Yeah, I've got a Stephanie Reed.

288
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,790
She said she had a job interview.

289
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,040
Stephanie
reed, r-e-e-d.

290
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,990
She just passed it off to Michael.

291
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,180
Server room could be anywhere in here.

292
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,310
Network and wiring
specifications require

293
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,170
A server that's on the first floor,

294
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,110
Centrally located, like right there.

295
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,670
What are you-- an
engineer or something?

296
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,550
Are you sure you know
how to drive this thing?

297
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,550
Yeah, but it's going to take a while

298
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,510
And I Don't want to get busted.

299
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,100
Just relax and find those e-mails.

300
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,260
Listen, man, when I steal, I do
it from my home, in my boxers,

301
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,670
Eating a bowl of krispity krunch, okay?

302
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,530
No chance of being seen,
no chance of getting caught.

303
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,990
Just get it Done.

304
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,040
Okay.

305
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,840
All right.

306
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,110
Come on, Michael, come on.

307
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,080
Hey, lady.

308
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,490
Did you get what I need?

309
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,220
Yeah, I got it.

310
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,030
Thank you.

311
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,740
I know what you're planning, Alex,

312
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,030
But listen to me.

313
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,900
If you do track him down, call me.

314
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't do something
that could get you hurt.

315
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,050
I won't.

316
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,420
So the material will be
where you asked by 5:00 p.M.

317
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,590
And Alex... I'm so sorry.

318
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,180
Good-bye, Lang.

319
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,970
I'm sorry, they can't see you today,

320
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,360
And there's nothing more I can do.

321
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,830
Okay.

322
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,560
Thank you for your
help, I appreciate it.

323
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,580
Uh, what was the name

324
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,130
Of the temp agency that sent you?

325
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,200
Uh, maybe we can...

326
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,550
Call them together and...

327
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,470
Figure this all out.

328
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,800
I have it written down in my car.

329
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,260
Where the hell's my
security badge, sweetheart?

330
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,250
It ain't at my station.

331
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,510
It was there when you showed up.

332
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,460
Take your hands off me.
I Don't have your badge.

333
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,550
I Don't have your badge. Yeah,
well, we'll see about that.

334
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,270
Sara's in trouble.

335
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,710
What's going on?

336
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,730
She's been made.

337
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,490
Michael, Sara's been made.

338
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,270
Is she all right?

339
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,590
The guard has her; you got

340
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,830
To get out of there now.

341
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,930
Roland, I'll be back.

342
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,920
Where are you going?

343
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,360
Just keep working.

344
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,150
Like I said, sir, I
Don't have your badge.

345
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,630
Excuse me, I need to leave.

346
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,530
You can tell your story
to the cops, sister.

347
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,900
Don't move.

348
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,660
What the hell?

349
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,760
Roland, talk to me.

350
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,270
We're almost there, almost there.

351
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,100
We got to go.

352
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,050
We got to go now.

353
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,960
Got it!

354
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,320
Why won't the door open?

355
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,220
What the hell is that?

356
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,940
It's a fail-safe device, activated

357
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,260
When the alarm gets pulled,

358
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,790
To protect the server from fire damage.

359
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,540
Then why the hell did you pull it?

360
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,790
This is an old building.

361
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,060
It shouldn't have such an
advanced system. Oh, yeah?

362
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,130
Well, clearly it does.
Wha-wha-what's it do?

363
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,970
To kill the fire

364
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,810
It sucks all the
oxygen out of this room.

365
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,310
Michael, where the hell are you?

366
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,880
It's getting crowded out here.

367
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,270
Linc, Linc, we're trapped.

368
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,400
What? We're in the server room.

369
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,580
What? It's sealed.

370
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,010
They're sucking all the oxygen out.

371
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,480
We've got... Two, maybe
three minutes of air left.

372
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,180
Linc?

373
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,860
Linc?

374
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,790
I can't breathe.

375
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,230
I can't breathe.

376
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,100
Calm down.

377
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,310
You panic, it gets worse.

378
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,440
Come on.

379
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,310
Let's go.

380
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,060
You think we're spinning our wheels?

381
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,220
No, we ain't got no choice.

382
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,400
We got to wait and see if he shows up.

383
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,030
I'm not talking about finding Tuxhorn.

384
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,260
I'm talking about finding the cards.

385
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,170
I'm talking about finding six cards,

386
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,540
And I'm talking about whether we have

387
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,390
A snowball's chance in haiti
of actually doing this deed.

388
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,800
Better than no chance.

389
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,080
Just saying we're a
couple hours from mexico...

390
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,310
...And I wouldn't mind
having someone with me

391
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,940
Who could actually
speak the native tongue.

392
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,200
Just do your job, Brad.

393
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,900
You feeling good, Bruce?

394
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,400
You look great.

395
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,330
Your father, Josh,

396
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,400
Is so happy you made it to
the family reunion picnic.

397
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,850
He's missed you very much.

398
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,230
My father is dead.

399
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,740
That's right.

400
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,370
He is.

401
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,170
You see that, Bruce?

402
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,440
You just told me the truth in
response to something I said

403
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,600
Because lying is so hard right now...

404
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,740
...But telling the truth is so easy.

405
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,030
So tell me the truth.

406
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,610
Tell me what everyone at
the picnic wants to know.

407
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:04,290
Where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows?

408
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,850
I, I Don--
I Don't know.

409
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,240
Bruce.

410
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,330
A bad storm's coming.

411
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,030
A real bad storm.

412
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,010
Don Self.

413
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,290
Good.

414
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,510
So, so the senator did get my message?

415
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,430
No, no, I'm sorry, tomorrow's too late.

416
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,230
Okay, i-i-i need
to speak to him now.

417
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,010
Thank you... Thank you.

418
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,330
Agent Self, it's Time to go.

419
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,930
Pappa paul's pizza palace.

420
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,990
Yeah, I'd like a large

421
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,770
With extra pepperoni and extra cheese.

422
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,810
The knobbit.

423
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,720
Add momma to the train.

424
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,650
Amateur screen tests #9.

425
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,250
And we have a winner.

426
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,190
Thank you for calling Gate.

427
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,290
How may I help you?

428
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,130
The first e-mail is
an ad for discretia.

429
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,790
An e-mail for pecker pills?

430
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,290
You want the number?

431
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,690
That's great.

432
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,780
Definitely worth almost
losing my life for.

433
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,070
Second e-mail's an invitation

434
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,430
To join some kind of stargazers' club.

435
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,420
You know, constellations can be
used to track points on earth.

436
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,370
There is a website that
can let you know coordinates

437
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,270
Of star patterns, and
depending on the date,

438
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,120
It'll pick a corresponding
location on earth.

439
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,640
And you know this because...?

440
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,210
Because my son and...

441
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,590
My ex and... And I used to go

442
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,370
On this site, so they could look

443
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,150
Up at the sky and know where I was.

444
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,530
That's not it-- that
constellation's over antarctica.

445
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,300
He's not going to get
there today by 4:00 p.M.,

446
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,310
Not from l.A.

447
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,960
So, I almost died for nothing.

448
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,440
That's good to know. A
lot of people have died.

449
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,120
Well, that's their problem, okay,

450
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,190
Because anyone who gives
up their life for this crap

451
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,360
Is a sucker,

452
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,390
'cause you guys can't win!

453
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,910
Say it about the people who died.

454
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,460
Say it.

455
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:10,920
Say it.

456
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,190
Alex.

457
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,430
Get up.

458
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,240
Get back on your nerd
box and do your job.

459
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,050
We can get a little place by the water,

460
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,300
And you'd be better off

461
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,320
Not being on the run
by yourself, either.

462
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,860
I vouched for you, Bellick.

463
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,410
I told Michael, "brad
helped me get to chicago.

464
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,490
He's a good guy, trust him."

465
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,220
Are you crazy?

466
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,510
And now you just want to run

467
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,140
When we have a chance
to clear our names?

468
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,930
Odds of that Don't look so good.

469
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,190
Tank's full, gas pedal's on the right,

470
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,470
I say we get the hell out of dodge

471
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,360
Right now-- we can worry
about the ankle bracelets

472
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,440
Once we get over the border.

473
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,630
You listen to me.

474
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,010
There's only one thing
I'm thinking about.

475
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,150
She weighs seven pounds,
has her mother's eyes

476
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,180
And my heart in the
palm of her tiny hands,

477
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,720
So if I have to find one card

478
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,120
Or six cards

479
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,600
Or six million cards,

480
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,870
I'm going to do whatever it takes

481
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,480
'cause I only got to hold
my baby girl for ten seconds,

482
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,290
And that wasn't nearly long enough.

483
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,980
What are you doing?

484
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,870
This guy ain't showing up.

485
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,270
Hey, get your hands
where we can see them!

486
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,510
Get your hands up!

487
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Oh, my god, this ain't good.

488
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,720
I got them up, I got them up!

489
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,400
Put your hands up, Sucre, come on, man.

490
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,500
Who you calling? Hold on.

491
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,890
Come on, put your hands up!

492
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,000
Okay, okay, Don't shoot, Don't shoot.

493
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,050
Don't shoot, man, we're all right.

494
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,500
Computer's frozen.

495
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,580
What do you mean, it's
frozen? I-i Don't know.

496
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,430
It's just not responding.

497
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,980
I've rebooted twice now.

498
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,220
It's still not letting me on.

499
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:43,900
Try again.

500
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,180
Look, I've tried a stop
route, a jock program,

501
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,600
Even a back-door entry--
I mean, you were in prison,

502
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,850
I'm sure you're familiar with that one.

503
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,140
You want to stop breathing?

504
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,300
What happened?

505
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,030
They locked me out.

506
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,560
I'm telling you,

507
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,770
They're shutting us down.

508
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,020
We gotta go.

509
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,140
They're coming after us. Whoa.

510
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,150
We gotta go, let's go,
come on. Whoa, whoa.

511
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,760
Wait a minute, we run, they shoot us!

512
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,380
Stay.

513
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,480
Sara? Yeah.

514
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,050
Let's go, we gotta go.

515
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,230
You said we'd have
until the end of today.

516
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,950
No, this goes way over my head.

517
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,420
Look, this project's been terminated.

518
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,300
Now pull over and end this.

519
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,650
We can finish the job.

520
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,540
There is no more job, okay?

521
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,740
If you make this takedown
public, going back to prison

522
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,410
Is going to be the
least of your worries.

523
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,380
Lose him.

524
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,120
Stay on him, stay on him.

525
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,220
Let's go, let's go!

526
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,870
It's this
way-- go!

527
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,770
Go, go, go!

528
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,660
Thank you for calling Gate.

529
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,660
How may I help you?

530
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,860
Yes, hi, my name is Cole Pfeiffer.

531
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,220
Uh, I'm calling about my,
uh, commencement bonus.

532
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,930
I haven't received it yet, and, uh...

533
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,790
Oh, of course, mr. Pfeiffer.

534
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,940
Um, mr. White is out right now,

535
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,480
But he's going to be so
upset he missed your call.

536
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,170
Here, let me try to track him down.

537
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,010
Oh, no, no, Don't bother.

538
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,190
Uh, maybe you just could, uh,
uh, forward the check to me.

539
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,900
No, mr. White has to
sign off on any checks,

540
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,910
And I know that he really
wants to talk to you,

541
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,260
So can I have him reach you

542
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,740
At the number that came up on my i.D.?

543
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,280
Looking forward to it.

544
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,440
Why the hell did you tell Self

545
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,200
That we could get a cardholder by today?

546
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,130
He set the terms, Alex!

547
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,030
I didn't have a choice!

548
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,230
And now none of us have a choice.

549
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,140
And I am not going back to prison.

550
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,970
And I still have things that I need...

551
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,690
Not going back. Go ahead and run!

552
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,220
Guys, stop.

553
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,540
We ain't running anywhere

554
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,020
With these things on
our ankles, all right?

555
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,550
It's over here.

556
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,250
It's this way.

557
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,100
Wait a minute.

558
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,180
Wait a second.

559
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,870
The signal... The signal's gone.

560
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,820
The signal is gone.

561
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,740
Where are they?

562
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,780
Okay, we gotta go looking for them.

563
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,970
We cannot stay here forever.

564
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,000
They will eventually figure this out.

565
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,320
I Don't care if this place
blocks the signal or not.

566
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,860
Mike, what the hell are you doing, man?

567
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,230
We Don't have Time for this.

568
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,850
The answers are in
here, they have to be.

569
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,250
If I can just find them,
we might have a chance.

570
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,790
It's an ad-- the
words Don't make sense.

571
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,870
It's gibberish. Exactly, and that's what

572
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,130
Makes them ideal for hiding data.

573
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,580
Forget about the damn cardholder.

574
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,950
Self pulled the plug on us.

575
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,490
Are you okay?

576
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,490
Yeah, yeah.

577
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,960
We're going to figure this out.

578
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,590
We're getting good at
pulling off the impossible.

579
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,910
Hell, I came back from the dead, right?

580
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,880
What is it?

581
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,340
What do you see?

582
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,890
They go over each other.

583
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,110
Power plant.

584
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,040
New beach.

585
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,880
There's a power plant in Newport beach.

586
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,150
That's your meeting.

587
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,260
We ain't got long until 4:00.

588
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,940
How the hell are we
going to get out of here?

589
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,430
How fast can you run?

590
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,470
Is that signal?

591
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,310
Yeah, they're heading west.

592
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,470
Four blocks.

593
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,380
Go!

594
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,370
Move, damn it.

595
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,600
What? Get out of the cab.

596
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,840
What the hell do you think you're doing?

597
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,590
Hello?

598
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,100
Cole Pfeiffer, Gregory White here.

599
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,930
Oh, sorry

600
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,660
To disturb you, sir, I was just calling

601
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,530
About the, uh... The bonus stipend.

602
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,390
Bother me? What are
you talking about, son?

603
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,970
I'm just thrilled to finally be able

604
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,260
To put a voice to the
e-mail, and better yet,

605
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,750
I'm going to be able to
put a face to the voice.

606
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,710
Right... Because we haven't met yet.

607
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,860
Yes, and that is a crime, my friend.

608
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,030
I gotta tell you, there are
a lot of people over here

609
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,660
At Gate who are very
excited about meeting you,

610
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,360
But I'm going off to oahu
tomorrow with my wife.

611
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,190
I'd love to see you

612
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,680
Before I go, so why
Don't you come to Gate

613
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,170
First thing in the morning?

614
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,660
I think we can all learn something

615
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,150
From the number one salesman
in the entire northeast region.

616
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,760
Well, it... It's what Gate teaches.

617
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,550
"you can unshackle others

618
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,330
With the keys of knowledge."

619
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,920
It... It... I... It's
what I'm here to share,

620
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,760
It's what I know, it's
what I want to give back.

621
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,600
See, that's why I started this Company,

622
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,630
So that people can avoid
"the captivity of negativity."

623
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,880
Amen to that, mr. White.

624
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,100
Now I gotta go, I've got a lunch,

625
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,150
But I'll see you at Gate
first thing tomorrow,

626
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,590
And I'll set your office up,

627
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,840
Get you in the payroll system,
and I will personally hand you

628
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,930
Your bonus check.

629
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,890
Well, I'll see you at
Gate tomorrow, then.

630
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,380
Grab a bat, Cole Pfeiffer.

631
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,180
Coach just put you in the game.

632
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,900
Strange place for a meeting.

633
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,280
A little cloak-and-dagger,
Don't you think?

634
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,090
Belts and suspenders,
Stuart, belts and suspenders.

635
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,430
Why Laos?

636
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,650
A doctor doesn't perform
his first dissection

637
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,170
On a human cadaver.

638
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,410
First, he learns on a frog, then a pig,

639
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,650
Then one day, a human.

640
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,010
Laos is our frog.

641
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,420
Perhaps Denmark or Chad will be our pig.

642
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,950
After that, anything we
want can be our cadaver.

643
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,040
All right, let's check on the other side

644
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,880
Of the complex; they
could be meeting there.

645
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,830
Run!

646
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,020
Don't move, Burrows.

647
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,750
Don't you move an inch.

648
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,020
I'm taking you down.

649
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,040
Don't move.

650
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,420
Do not move an inch.

651
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,510
Hold! Stop!

652
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,930
Go.

653
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,540
Are you sure about this. Yeah, go.

654
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,380
Freeze. Don't move.

655
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,140
Hands up. Keep your
hands where I can see 'em.

656
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,010
Aah! Come on.

657
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,050
Stop! Hold it!

658
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,930
Hands up.

659
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:49,980
Hold it.

660
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,820
Let's see your hands.

661
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,930
Get him up.

662
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,100
Scofield ran.

663
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,830
Won't take long to find him.

664
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,070
You're just delaying the inevitable.

665
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,610
What's inevitable is a
meeting with Scylla. Shut up!

666
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,690
Put him in the car.

667
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,530
Listen. We went through Tuxhorn's pda.

668
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,160
They got a meeting on the
other side of that building.

669
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,260
It's over. It's not over.

670
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,720
It's over, Lincoln, okay?

671
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,840
I know you wanted this to work out,

672
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,940
But it's beyond me now.

673
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:14,860
Okay, it's Done.

674
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,100
I have orders. It's over.

675
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,620
It's-it's not.

676
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,060
It's finished!

677
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,930
So, when exactly does the
op-order commence, general?

678
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,040
It already has.

679
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,890
No. I mean, when do
we see ramifications?

680
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,180
I'll tell you what, Stuart.

681
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,090
You worry about the gigahertz
and the offshore drilling.

682
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,340
Let me worry about the op-orders.

683
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,540
Oh.

684
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,010
There they come.

685
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,890
What about her?

686
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,100
Let her go.

687
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,450
Hey, hey, real group of winners

688
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,290
You hooked me up with

689
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,440
Here, Donnie. Thanks
a lot. I appreciate it.

690
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,380
Look, man, we both have
worn the badge in our day.

691
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,060
I-i can't survive any
more Time in lock-up.

692
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,460
Can-can we please work something out?

693
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,460
No. You can work your
ass into this van. Get in.

694
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,720
Congratulations. Company wins.

695
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,300
Come on, get in.

696
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,260
What? Get in.

697
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,090
You got to be kidding me.

698
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,390
It's Michael.

699
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,910
Easy.

700
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,210
Gave you a good enough head start.

701
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,430
Should have took advantage of it.

702
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,600
Yeah, but then I wouldn't have
been able to give you this.

703
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,590
Press the video function.

704
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,700
It wasn't a meeting

705
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,120
Between two Scylla
cardholders, agent Self.

706
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,520
It was a meeting

707
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,780
Between all six cardholders.

708
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,060
So now we know who has
the other five cards,

709
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,400
And that should mean something,

710
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,790
Even to someone whose
word means nothing.

711
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,800
I'm gonna call senator Dallo now.

712
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,280
But he follows my recommendations, Don.

713
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,000
The next Time you run from me,

714
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,030
I'm not gonna be chasing
you down in a car.

715
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,310
It's gonna be with a
bullet in your back.

716
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,670
Let 'em go.

717
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,960
All of 'em.

718
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,380
Come on.

719
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,250
Let 'em go.

720
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,910
Put 'em in the warehouse.

721
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,510
All of 'em.

722
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,850
Come on

723
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,570
Yeah, it's Don Self.

724
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,730
I need to talk to him right now.

725
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,680
Right now.

726
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,050
Some day soon, we're gonna
drop that lifeboat of yours

727
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,070
In the water and disappear forever.

728
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,000
I promise.

729
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,670
Hey, where's mr. Personality going?

730
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,590
They check his wrists? 'cause he must...

731
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,000
Let him be.

732
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,640
Insubordination's tiring, huh?

733
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,410
Where the hell do you get off
calling senator Dallo directly?

734
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,810
You Don't move into my city,

735
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,810
Into my regional office
and go over my head!

736
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,160
What do you want from me?

737
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,920
You know how it works, Herb.

738
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,370
You think when the Company's
breathing down your neck,

739
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,740
Senator Dallo's gonna
bring in the cavalry?

740
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,730
He'll pretend he's
never even heard of you.

741
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,610
You're on your own from now on, Self.

742
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,480
You're an island.

743
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:24,260
If I'm an island, what
are you doing here?

744
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,540
Get out of my office and
let me finish what I started.

745
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,580
When you do get buried,

746
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,290
I'll be the first one
there with a shovel.

747
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,740
Great. See you then.

748
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,200
Sara Tancredi's

749
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,070
Somewhere safe, isn't she, Bruce?

750
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,900
You would have made sure
of that, wouldn't you?

751
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,670
So tell me, where is Sara?

752
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,370
Help me get your family to Sara,

753
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,660
Where it's safe.

754
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,330
Safe.

755
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,730
Los angeles?

756
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,940
Where in los angeles?

757
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,760
I Don't know.

758
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,090
I Don't know.

759
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,780
I believe you.

760
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,310
Good job.

761
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,240
Picnic's over,

762
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,690
Bruce.

763
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,130
What's up with Mahone?

764
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,240
They murdered his son.

765
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,880
The Company killed his son like...

766
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,300
Like they tried to kill lj.

767
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,380
Alex, i, uh...

768
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,520
Uh, i-i know what happened.

769
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,790
I'm sorry.

770
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,100
They did this...

771
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,930
...To get to me,

772
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,830
To flush me out.

773
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,380
And then they let my ex-wife

774
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,820
Stay alive...

775
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,730
...Just so she could
tell me that she was next

776
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,530
If... If I didn't turn myself in.

777
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,520
Now she's in protective custody,

778
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,390
And I'm living in a
warehouse trying to find

779
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,900
The son of a bitch who killed my kid.

780
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,790
We're all here for something.

781
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,670
All of us are here for something.

782
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,950
You need to stay focused
until this is Done.

783
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,870
I can do my job.

784
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,450
I promise.

785
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,250
Good.

786
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,480
And I promise I'll do whatever it takes

787
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,520
To help you find the
person that killed your son

788
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,400
And the people behind the hit.

789
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,400
We're gonna get these guys, Alex.

790
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,110
I'm gonna help you.
