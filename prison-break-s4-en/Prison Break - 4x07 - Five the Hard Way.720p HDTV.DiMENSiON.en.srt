1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,630
Previously on prison break:

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,720
These are gps ankle monitors.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,590
Now,step up,take one and put it on.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,350
When the exchange is over,you and I are gonna spend some quality time.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,650
Mahone: These aren't release papers.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,360
I did the best I could do.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,750
You need to sign those so I can collect roland's device.

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,850
You want me to give up the one thing that makes me valuable to the team.

9
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,690
Hey,you knew the deal when you came onboard.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,380
Do you want to flush it down the toilet because you made a bad move?

11
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,050
This man just came into a $100,000 inheritance.

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,450
I don't recognize him.

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,850
If you do see him,would you please give us a call?

14
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,130
You don't work for the irs?

15
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,840
I don'T.

16
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,940
Who do you work for?

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,910
As of now.

18
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,960
myself.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,030
I'm an associate of general krantz.

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,180
The general,he likes his privacy.

21
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,910
I knew you were rotten from the beginning,

22
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,760
so I want you to walk me through this and if you can't,

23
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,570
I'm gonna call the authorities.

24
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,520
Cole pfeiffer.

25
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,010
Who the hell are you?

26
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:26,710
the last time a pretty little filly like yourself knocked me senseless and tied me to a chair,

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,750
I had to pay for it.

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,890
You still might.

29
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,220
That book was a gift from a very dear friend of mine who left this realm all too soon.

30
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,060
The only thing that james whistler ever gave anybody was the clap.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,700
You have 30 seconds to tell me something that I don't already know.

32
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:59,090
I followed that book from panama city,where james whistler and I were co-incarcerated,

33
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,530
to a bus locker in san diego.

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,710
Inside was information pertaining to this apartment.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,000
scylla.

36
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,150
How about that?

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,550
That ring a bell,huh?

38
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,830
What do you know about scylla?

39
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,200
I know I'm holding the keys,because without me,

40
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,280
that bird book's about as meaningful as a fart in a wind storm.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,730
I commandeered whistler's alias.

42
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,770
I infiltrated his place of business because it's the gateway to the whole damn thing.

43
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,350
Where's the location?

44
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,720
What do you bring to the jamboree,darling,huh?

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,170
Aside from those baby blues and a knife?

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,510
This is me.

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,710
This is scylla.

48
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,780
This is you.

49
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,060
I am gonna get scylla.

50
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,490
And it can either be with you.

51
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,080
or through you.

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,190
so why don't you give me that informed decision right now,

53
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,580
before I spill your hillbilly guts all over the carpet?

54
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,030
'Cause you're messing with the wrong bitch.

55
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,170
How may I be of service?

56
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,060
This is unbelievable.

57
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,350
We were planning our move on scuderi when he chartered the flight.

58
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,030
Right.And no chance you dragged your feet a little bit

59
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,990
waiting for scuderi to charter the flight?

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,420
Oh,yeah,we want to drag this out.

61
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,680
Yeah,well,location's pretty convenient,wouldn't you say,linc?

62
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,990
Uh,scuderi splitting town kind of caught us a break,huh?

63
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,180
Would you shut him up?

64
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,420
No,no.

65
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,290
We could just wait till he comes back.

66
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,740
Agrisow makes farm chemicals.

67
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,070
It's not fort knox.

68
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,410
You want to bet?

69
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,030
Their patents are worth billions.

70
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,710
Which is why companies tend to keep a very close eye on those patents.

71
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,110
Yeah,we could breach their security,in a week,minimum.

72
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,300
We could get in the guy's house-- week,minimum.

73
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,540
Or we could follow the guys for 12 hours out of town and have card five by midnight.

74
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,680
How's that sound?

75
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,610
"How's that sound?

76
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,260
If you're not back by midnight you're going to jail.

77
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,820
Yeah,don't I know it.

78
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,870
Let's talk outside.

79
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,840
So what's the plan?

80
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,580
We're going to vegas.

81
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,600
oh,hell yes!

82
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,360
Yo,I call shotgun!

83
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,680
Who's got-- hey.

84
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,820
Yeah!

85
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,910
So what do you want to talk about,agent self?

86
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,490
I've been a part of hundreds of operations during my career--

87
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,630
and I'll tell you one thing.

88
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,130
I never been on the top of someone else's hit list.

89
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:45,750
What are you talking about?

90
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,480
What am I talking about?

91
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,740
If this company hit man wyatt can find me once,

92
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,800
it's only a matter of time until he creeps up in the back of my rearview mirror again.

93
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,710
Well,that's not true.

94
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,010
'Cause you'll never see him coming at all if he's coming after you.

95
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,800
Yeah.

96
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,460
That's comforting.

97
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,600
What do you think,I want that?

98
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,490
You're dead,we're all back in jail.

99
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,500
You were an agent longer than me.

100
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,400
What's my play here?

101
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,620
Okay.

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,540
Let me get this straight.

103
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,580
You turn your back on me and now you want to know my play?

104
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,610
- That was your fault.
- Really?

105
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,400
What would you have done?

106
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,950
I've tracked down rapists,killers,even former military,

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,980
but a structural engineer from illinois was able to get to me.

108
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,770
Want to know how?

109
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,600
Yeah,I want to know.

110
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,390
He stopped running.

111
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,400
He got aggressive.

112
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,760
He took the game to me.

113
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,390
That's your play.

114
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,380
That's your only play.

115
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,100
I shouldn't have to remind you that killing a federal agent is a complicated matter--

116
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,240
even in our line of work.

117
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,290
Perhaps mahone is just the tip of the iceberg.

118
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,850
We've been searching for the link between supermax and burrows and scofield.

119
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,130
I believe we found it.

120
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,650
If scofield and burrows are working with the government,

121
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,740
we've got a much bigger problem than one bureaucrat at homeland security.

122
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,710
But it begins with that bureaucrat.

123
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,170
And if don self is the head of the snake.

124
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,200
make it look like an accident.

125
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,910
My fee just doubled,by the way.

129
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,840
hello?

130
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,790
Uh,hi,is this brad?

131
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,240
Yeah.

132
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,100
Uh,you came by my office a couple of days ago looking for a guy

133
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,130
who had an inheritance coming to him.

134
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,940
Right.

135
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,950
I know where he is.

136
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,370
She wants two grand first.

137
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,390
I'm meeting her at noon.

138
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,940
Okay,the next card's more important,right?

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,920
So vegas first,then we deal with t-bag.

140
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,420
Shut up!

141
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,910
I'll stay.

142
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,650
All right.

143
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,460
Linc,take,uh,sara and sucre.

144
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,940
roland to vegas.

145
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,770
The rest of us.

146
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,820
will handle t-bag.

147
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,270
You heard the man,let's go.

148
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,830
promise me something,would you?

149
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,620
Yeah.

150
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,260
Can you get me carrot top's autograph?

151
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,190
'Cause I just think that would make this whole thing worthwhile.

152
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,480
Be safe.

153
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,930
Ay,yo,vegas,bitches!

154
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,640
He should have the info by now.

155
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,960
okay,what the hell's taking bellick so long?

156
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,760
Yes.

157
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,050
She wants more money.

158
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,120
How much more?

159
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,830
I don't know.

160
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,440
You got to come talk to this chick.

161
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,960
Hold on,hold on.

162
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,190
What's going on,bellick?

163
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,650
Believe it.

164
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,360
Sorry,guys,I walked right into it,too.

165
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,430
Go.

166
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,700
Come on,now!

167
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,740
Go!

168
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,460
You have no idea who you're working with,honey.

169
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,410
Why don't we skip the theatrics and you just tell us what you want.

170
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,560
I'd love to put a hole right in your head.

171
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,070
Time's up.

172
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,890
Him,too.

173
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,560
Let's all get in the van.

174
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,010
Let's all get in the van now.

175
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,670
You,too,mahone.

176
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,190
Mahone!

177
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,910
I remember the day we met,pretty.

178
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,790
You were a scared little college boy sittin' up on those bleachers,

179
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,320
tryin' to keep your ass out of the game.

180
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,640
Now look at you.

181
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,550
Cold.

182
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,920
Hard.Like a dried up flower wanting to get watered.

183
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,210
Just tell me what you want.

184
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,210
I want to make you bleed.

185
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:37,920
I want to release the sinner inside of me that got me incarcerated so many years ago.

186
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,210
But it seems you caught yourself a break,pretty.

187
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,880
I need you.

188
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:50,890
Now.

189
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,740
you gonna cooperate right quick or so help me I'm gonna stomp you till you can't stand.

190
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,060
The pages-- look at them.

191
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,530
Looks like some kind of map,right?

192
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,260
I don't know.

193
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,910
You know enough to chase me down looking for this.

194
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,440
Now don't lie to me,pretty.

195
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,070
Whatever's in that book-- it is bigger than you and me.

196
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,340
What,like scylla big?

197
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,830
This is not a game,theodore.

198
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,110
Now,you need to tell me who you've been talking to.

199
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,300
I don't need to do a damn thing.

200
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,740
That's the benefit of being the man with the gun.

201
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,240
Now.

202
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,220
you're going to write down everything you already know about scylla,

203
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,950
aneverything you learn from that book.

204
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,770
or I'm going to paint these walls with your gray matter.

205
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,970
Get to work!

206
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,790
hello.

207
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,290
All right.I'll be right there.

208
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,330
Self.

209
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,460
HeY.

210
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,310
Michael's position hasn't changed since you called.

211
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,030
How do we know he.

212
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,740
Bagwell's a psychopath,but he's a psychopath with a plan.

213
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,150
He obviously needs something from michael,

214
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,500
and as long as michael doesn't give it to him,he'll keep breathing.

215
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,130
All right.

216
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,020
I'm coming with you.

217
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,720
No,no,no,no.

218
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,120
I got it.

219
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,620
Stick to the plan.

220
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,370
Will you forget about maricruz?

221
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,460
You think she didn't know her sister was trying to set you up,man?

222
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,390
You better get some ass in vegas,bro.

223
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,960
We're here to copy the card.

224
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,730
Then we leave.

225
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,690
Got it?

226
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,800
Have you heard from michael?

227
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,100
No.

228
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,250
Why?

229
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,540
Nothing.

230
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,630
I want this thing done.

231
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,020
Vegas ain't my town.

232
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
What a fool,huh?

233
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,550
How could anyone not love this place,right?

234
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,740
Check this out.

235
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,440
Right there.

236
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,320
The asian guy.

237
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,730
I know I've seen him someplace before.

238
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,900
So what do you have for me?

239
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,790
So what's "gate"?

240
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,760
Excuse me?

241
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,920
It's on that box.

242
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,690
why do you want to know?

243
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,350
Just curious.

244
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,820
What if I was tell you I think you're just stalling?

245
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,240
Biding time till you can figure out some macgyver way to get your ass out of here,huh?

246
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,630
I'd say you've got that gun pointed at the one person who can help you.

247
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,870
So why don't you stop wasting my time?

248
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,330
Please,don't let him!

249
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,650
How 'bout her,huh?

250
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,340
How 'bout her,michael?

251
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,890
Any reason why I shouldn't kill her?

252
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,920
Let's do a test.

253
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,940
No!

254
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,500
How far gone is michael scofield?

255
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,610
Michael,just tell him what he wants!

256
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,340
how far gone is michael scofield?

257
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,090
Please,don't let him.

258
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,150
When did it happen,michael?

259
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,780
Please,don't let him.

260
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,630
when did you stop caring about hurting people,huh?

261
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,390
Fox river?

262
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,940
Sona?

263
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,210
You gonna keep dragging your feet while I put a bullet in her brain?

264
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,680
Why don't you put that gun down.

265
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,220
I'll put it down when you start writing down,pretty!

266
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Last chance.

267
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,390
Three!

268
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,100
Two!

269
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,120
One.

270
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,860
all right!

271
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,590
The pages,they fit together.

272
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,580
But it's not a map.

273
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,450
It's a blueprint.

274
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,690
For what?

275
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,220
our friend,ick,is wearing a government-issued ankle monitor.

276
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,880
My guess is that scofield has one,too.

277
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,140
I knew that son of a bitch was slow-walking me.

278
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,040
Any minute,federal agents could come blasting through that door.

279
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,780
So what do we do?

280
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,760
I need you to get the make and serial number of that monitor.

281
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,940
Feel free to pitch in here,miss daisy.

282
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,550
If scofield knows I'm involved,this is over.

283
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,520
We need to keep him on point.

284
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,540
Now,get out there and get that information.

285
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,990
What about the agents?

286
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,920
Let 'em come.

287
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,530
How do we even know this guy's out gambling?

288
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,240
The guy's got $300,000 in credit and a comped room.

289
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,790
He's here.

290
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,940
Keep looking.

291
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,900
Hey,sara.

292
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,420
Hey,uh,I realize this might not be the best time for this,

293
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,010
but I still haven't heard from michael.

294
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,410
They must be dealing with t-bag.

295
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,380
Lincoln,come on.

296
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,430
What?

297
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,380
Vegas just isn't your town?

298
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,590
From everything I've heard about you,that would be a pretty big change of pace.

299
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,880
I guess so.

300
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,230
Lincoln,please talk to me.

301
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,480
Has michael told you about mom?

302
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,770
No.

303
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,420
They were much alike.

304
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,360
They got the same mind.

305
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,410
As mom got older,she started to lose it.

306
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,530
We,uh,later found out it was a symptom of a brain tumor,hama.

307
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,770
- hamartoma.
- Yeah.

308
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,620
As a kid,she got nosebleeds.

309
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,710
They stopped.

310
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,980
In her 30s,they started up again.

311
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,880
She later died of a brain aneurysm.

312
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,030
And you're telling me this,because michael and his mother are similar in that way,too,right?

313
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,310
He got nosebleeds as a kid.

314
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,230
They stopped,and the last couple of days they started up again.

315
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,980
How old was your mom when she passed away?

316
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,140
Thirty-one.

317
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,060
Michael's just turned 31.

318
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,220
yeah?

319
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,570
I found him.

320
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,690
Keep an eye on him.

321
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,740
Okay.

322
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,390
Andrew blaer?

323
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,610
Uh,yeah.

324
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,370
Can I help you?

325
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,830
I hope so.

326
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,100
Any boyfriends or roommates I should know about?

327
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,880
No.

328
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,240
Any deliveries scheduled for today?

329
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,960
No.

330
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,110
I'm giving you one more.

331
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,120
what is all this?

332
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,110
You okay?

333
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,500
They told me not to talk to you.

334
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,370
"They"?

335
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,830
Who's they?

336
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,740
This is whistler's blueprint.

337
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,720
It's the building where we can find scylla.

338
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,590
In other words,it's gate.

339
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,640
Where's scylla?

340
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,580
I can't be certain until I see the building itself,

341
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,170
but I'm pretty sure it's somewhere down here,below this office.

342
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,650
What is scylla?

343
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,270
It's the company's little black book.

344
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,340
I want you to take me to gate,now.

345
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:37,230
Because you can smell that scylla money,can't you?

346
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,630
That's what you're in it for,just like me.

347
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,270
Say it.

348
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,860
Come on.

349
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,170
I want you to say it.

350
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,560
I'm in it for the money.

351
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,350
you see?

352
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,830
We ain't so different after all.

353
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,160
yes?

354
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,780
Don self is not at his house.

355
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,690
Looks like he cleared out.

356
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,520
Notify our people inside
the bureau and lapd.

357
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,270
I doubt that he could
have gotten very far.

358
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,500
Sir?

359
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,300
Not now.

360
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,620
Don self is here to see you.

361
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,610
got to warn you, friend, she's cold.

362
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,040
Device...

363
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,540
good luck, pal.

364
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,720
Stay with him.

365
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,500
Scofield's really getting
somewhere in there.

366
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,650
Man works fast.

367
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,780
Says he can't get any further without
seeing my former place of employment.

368
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,120
Did you take care of
our little troll problem?

369
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,960
Don't even think about doing this to me.

370
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,700
My name's on the door.

371
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,760
If I didn't think you were
valuable, you'd be dead already.

372
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,570
****

373
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,560
It's-it's just a little
sensory overload, guys.

374
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,190
There just wasn't any room for the card.

375
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,450
Right. Because if we turn
the device on in the casino,

376
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,910
it fills up on all the
data from the slots.

377
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,530
Like when they're about to pay out.

378
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,250
Oh, it's completely unintentional.

379
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,150
- Really?
- Yeah.

380
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,770
It's not why you built the
damn thing in the first place?

381
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,130
If we didn't need you.

382
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,860
but you do, so just take a
brewski and chill, all right?

383
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,780
Okay, we need to figure out
a way to get scuderi alone.

384
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,400
yeah.

385
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,090
The old man just showed up at the pool.

386
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,150
From what he's wearing, there's
no way he's got the card on him.

387
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,100
Stay with him.

388
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,210
Card's in his room.

389
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,220
Tell me, donald, how did you
play this moment out in your head?

390
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:45,480
Did you picture yourself coming in here, chest
out, jaw squared, ready to demand answers?

391
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:52,030
Did you at any time in your fantasy
imagine that you would be this nervous?

392
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,440
Honestly, I, uh.

393
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,190
I didn't think much
past giving you these.

394
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,690
Berlin.

395
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,720
Nigeria.

396
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,920
The comrie group.

397
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,370
Why not jfk and the lindbergh
baby while you're at it?

398
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,690
Son, those matters have been
fully vetted. They're relics.

399
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,100
I had nothing to do with them, and if
this is why you've been pulling data on me,

400
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,630
- I could have saved you a lot of trouble.
- Okay.

401
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,000
Well, these records and a sealed letter
explaining my investigation into your involvement

402
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,220
with these matters was sent to
five lawyers across the country.

403
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:36,750
If anything happens to me, if I go
missing, anything, if I wind up dead,

404
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,260
that letter is to be unsealed.

405
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,520
and they will find cold trails
that lead nowhere near me.

406
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,600
It doesn't matter.

407
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,170
If a government agent who was looking into
you is found floating in the L.A. River,

408
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,750
or whatever else you have planned,

409
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,600
your life, general,
will change dramatically.

410
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,810
There will be questions, media
coverage and surveillance,

411
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,640
and whatever you and the company are trying
to do next with your little laos game,

412
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:03,000
or whatever else you have planned, it'll be
next to impossible with thousands of eyes on you.

413
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,400
Okay? So back off of me.

414
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,160
You are no the first person
to attempt something like this.

415
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,470
Most of the others I now
fondly call my colleagues.

416
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,180
They've learned to put their
determination and focus to better use,

417
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,090
and with far greater compensation.

418
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,070
Wrong guy.

419
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,520
We'll see.

420
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,890
"Dear mr.White, due to
unforeseen circumstances, "

421
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,720
I regret to inform you that I will no
longer be able "to perform services at gate.

422
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,220
"I thank you for this opportunity.

423
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,940
"I'm deeply sorry "if this places
you in a difficult position.

424
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,680
"I have simply not been able
to escape these circumstances.

425
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,760
Thank you for the wonderful,
enriching opportunity."

426
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,850
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

427
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,090
Does it sound like you?

428
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,340
Yeah.

429
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,980
- Good.
- Yeah.

430
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,350
Look, I don't even
know who you are, okay?

431
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,320
- Just let me go.
- shut up.

432
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:07,460
And you wondered how I got to be the
top salesman in the northeast region.

433
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,790
Sorry, okay?

434
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,940
Sorry.

435
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,210
consider this a warning.

436
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:38,180
Old teddy bagwell may be coosa county trash,
but cole pfeiffer's a man of refinement.

437
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:43,360
One of the gate corporation's
tippy-top sellers, as a matter of fact.

438
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,950
Step into my office.

439
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,850
Well, there should be
a room-- eight by ten.

440
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,530
Whistler's point of entry.

441
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,720
That's a closet.

442
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,310
No, it's not.

443
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,920
tonic and lime, please.

444
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,860
Thank

445
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,500
I'm in the middle of this nightmare.

446
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,500
I wonder if you could help me.

447
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,460
it's my 22-year-old
cousin's bachelorette party.

448
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,950
That's hardly the salt mines.

449
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,190
Wait for it.

450
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,890
There's a scavenger hunt,

451
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,170
and my team has tasked me with getting
a photograph in a whale's suite.

452
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,750
I'm a whale?

453
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,400
With a very scary bodyguard
and a very gorgeous watch.

454
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,110
And you want to take
a picture in my room?

455
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,310
And I realize it's a completely
inappropriate request,

456
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,660
but they're already
calling me a wet blanket.

457
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,440
I'm sorry. I just can't help you.

458
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,300
What if I said "please"?

459
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,570
I'm actually a little desperate.

460
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,800
Best of luck.

461
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,770
drinks are on the
gentleman. Have a nice day.

462
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,560
You, too.

463
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,140
Don't take it personally.
You're not his type.

464
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:25,360
Right before you sat down, he
asked me if i liked to party.

465
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,240
Absolutely not! No way!

466
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,080
Oh, come on. Take one for the team.

467
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,440
Maricruz will never know.

468
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,300
I'm gonna snap his neck.

469
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,350
Get to his room, stay two
minutes, then leave, all right?

470
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,590
Yeah, yeah, and in the
meantime, what? In the elevator?

471
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,530
Just play hard to get, you know,
and then let him nuzzle a little bit.

472
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,250
What option we got?

473
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,600
Come on, man. What option
we got? Give me one.

474
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,510
you can'T. Here.

475
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,250
go ahead. There's nothing back there.

476
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,410
I know.

477
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,730
do we have anything sharp?

478
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,570
So, what are you hearing,
uh, scylla is worth, huh?

479
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,570
me, I'm hearing millions.

480
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,870
is that a rough ballpark
in terms of what you, uh.

481
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,130
what you've been told?

482
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,880
What do we have here?

483
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,600
Go ahead, back up.

484
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,250
you and me and a dark hole.

485
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,470
Just like old times, pretty.

486
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,300
You first.

487
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,480
How are the chips falling for you?

488
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,090
Spent my last buck on the beer.

489
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,720
What are the options when
you're broke in vegas?

490
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,630
I guess I got to work that out, huh?

491
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,590
what if you didn't have to?

492
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:16,500
I may have a little
business to throw your way.

493
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,940
What kind?

494
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,980
The easy kind.

495
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:30,050
with a $1,000 payout.

496
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,390
What's your cognac?

497
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,970
I've never had it.

498
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,830
I've got a 200-year-old
bottle in my suite.

499
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,090
Join me. This is private business.

500
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,940
Between men.

501
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,630
They're on their way up.

502
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,770
Get ready.

503
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,800
I love it--
mr. Macho man.

504
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,340
well, well, well.

505
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,570
What's next?

506
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,270
I don't know, why don't you figure
it out? I'm done helping you.

507
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,500
Sounds like someone's caught in
the old captivity of negativity.

508
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,960
Let's get you in a more
affirmative mindset. What's next?

509
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,480
I think I'm gonna lock you in this room.

510
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,130
And then, you're gonna be arrested
and taken back to fox river.

511
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,290
just how do you plan on.

512
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:58,020
stop, y'all have no
idea what you're doing.

513
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,000
Scofield, you can't do this without me.

514
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,270
Self's on his way.

515
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,110
- Mark my words!
- Got your message.

516
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,380
T-bag: Y'all have no
idea what you're doing!

517
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,930
Thanks, alex.

518
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,260
great city.

519
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,200
I guess so.

520
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,590
That's the thing about vegas.

521
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,810
Doesn't judge you.

522
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,630
Any form of pleasure is acceptable here.

523
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,300
Am I crazy, or is there
a note of plum in there?

524
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,260
Maybe.

525
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,730
Have a seat.

526
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,930
Did you serve?

527
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,850
Serve who?

528
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,240
In the military.

529
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,290
You look like a devil dog.

530
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,730
No, sir, I've never been
in the service before.

531
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,440
Filling up nice.

532
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,740
Sucre must be in close proximity.

533
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,530
Getting oiled, most likely.

534
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,370
One and half tours in vietnam.

535
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,130
Purple heart in a friendly
fire exchange near hue.

536
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,120
Sorry to hear it.

537
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:37,860
What I learned at hue, though valuable,

538
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,270
also cost me a great deal.

539
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,380
Specifically.

540
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,070
three square inches of
upper groin thigh meat.

541
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,200
And with that.

542
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,410
my reproductive and sexual function.

543
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,220
So. so you can'T.

544
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,760
mr. Villalobos, I'd
like you to meet my wife.

545
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,500
I'm alexa.

546
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,960
You want me to bang your wife?

547
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,420
And I'm gonna pay you $1,000.
Dont let your tvbecome just a box.

548
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,060
Ñç7vowhe's got a minute.
Then I'm going after him.

549
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,190
- did it copy the card?
- Yep.

550
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,140
All right, download that.
You got five minutes.

551
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,110
Well?

552
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,170
His wife was up there.

553
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,160
And.

554
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,490
It stays in vegas.

555
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,330
uh, hey, guys.

556
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,730
I'm gonna go hit the head, and
I'll be out in a minute, all right?

557
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,280
Yes.

558
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,870
Two. Two. two pulls.

559
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,310
two pulls, and he won the progressive.

560
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,930
Where the hell is he?

561
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,860
I'll go get him.

562
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,480
mr.Glenn.

563
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,740
We got a problem.

564
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:13,140
It was made clear you were never again
welcome in any nevada gaming establishment.

565
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,380
Wait, wait, uh, I was told
there was only a five-year.

566
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,310
no such thing was said to you.

567
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,720
What's that do?

568
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,470
It's a battery pack for
a video game console.

569
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,720
You'll need to buy a new one.

570
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,990
I already downloaded the
card onto my laptop, and.

571
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,030
and I can build another device.

572
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,550
You said this one takes
months. We don't have months.

573
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,190
You know what? We ought to
leave your ass in the desert.

574
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,370
Let's get him back to L.A.,
And let self sort him out.

575
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,150
Let's go.

576
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,330
for a little guy, he
has some set of lungs.

577
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,500
How's bellick and the girl?

578
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,510
All taken care of.

579
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,460
I'm gonna keep t-bag in protective
custody until we get scylla--

580
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,550
then, I'm gonna make somebody
at illinois doc very, very happy.

581
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,130
But more importantly, what the
hell is that room downstairs?

582
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,030
That's not where they keep the
device that decodes scylla, is it?

583
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,070
No. That's just what t-bag thought.

584
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,470
The road to scylla
only begins down there.

585
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,040
This is the room where
we've got t-bag now.

586
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:46,730
Just past the south wall, there's an access
tunnel that runs for about 300 yards or so.

587
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,330
We get through that, we're in.

588
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,910
That's where we can decode scylla.

589
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,080
And this is the building where
general krantz's office is.

590
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,730
There you go.

591
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,690
Self: I was there today, but I have to tell
you, the security in that place is unbelievable.

592
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,830
According to the blueprint, the
substructure is completely exposed.

593
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,980
It shouldn't take more than
24 hours to get in there.

594
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,640
It's only gonna take 24 hours?

595
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,830
All we have to do is
get that last card first.

596
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:12,230
Well, based on what I've deciphered so far,
we're gonna need around-the-clock access to gate,

597
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,830
starting immediately.

598
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:17,800
You can get us some suits and ids, we could
go in there as irs agents auditing the books--

599
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,910
I mean, considering the kind of racket they're
running, nobody would have a problem believing that.

600
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,480
Can you make that happen?

601
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,790
Yeah, I could do it.

602
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,370
it's under the can.

603
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,540
hello?

604
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,930
We have a lot in common.

605
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,340
Yeah, who is this?

606
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,090
Just another interested
party in what you're up to.

607
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,820
Yeah, what's that?

608
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,660
Scylla. Open the envelope.

609
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,540
The pages I've got only go up to 77.

610
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,410
Is this more blueprint?

611
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,280
I don't know.

612
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,290
What do you want?

613
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,910
I don't know what
you've done with bagwell,

614
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,790
but unless I see him, you're not
getting the rest of the pages.

615
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,910
- Is that right?
- Give me that.

616
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:10,430
Who is this?

617
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,110
Hello, michael.
