1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,184
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:07,947
If you're successful with obtaining Scylla,
you'll not only avoid jail time...

3
00:00:08,123 --> 00:00:10,683
...you can take pride
in knowing you helped dismantle...

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:13,123
...this country's greatest threat
to democracy.

5
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:17,090
If you're killed while doing so,
a proper funeral will be provided.

6
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:18,994
Gretchen has the rest of the pages.

7
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:21,260
We can't go further until
she gives them back.

8
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:24,894
- Why are we doing this again?
- It's an insurance policy.

9
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:29,009
You put gun on me again, these aren't
the only set of prints I'll be copying.

10
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:32,770
Mike.

11
00:00:33,848 --> 00:00:34,940
Michael, what's wrong?

12
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:36,549
Talk to me! Michael!

13
00:00:36,718 --> 00:00:41,485
I want Scylla out of Los Angeles
by the end of the day tomorrow.

14
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:45,325
Brad? Get out there!

15
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:47,324
- Push it.
- Don't do this.

16
00:00:47,762 --> 00:00:49,127
Brad!

17
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:07,013
If anything should happen,
call my mom in Chicago.

18
00:01:07,182 --> 00:01:08,706
Nothing's gonna happen.

19
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:14,019
- Where's Brad's body now?
- On its way to the morgue.

20
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,181
It's at the cooler at Homeland Security
where nobody can find it.

21
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:19,622
- Ain't the deal.
- You said if anything happened...

22
00:01:19,794 --> 00:01:22,763
...we'd be returned to next of kin.
- That's not what I said.

23
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:25,798
- That is exactly what you said.
- It isn't exactly what I said.

24
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:29,334
And he needs to stay a John Doe
until I say otherwise. Okay?

25
00:01:29,504 --> 00:01:32,098
I'm dealing with enough stuff
and I've had my ass...

26
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:44,982
He's got...

27
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:47,246
He's got a mother, you know.

28
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:49,982
If you want Scylla,
and I assume you still do...

29
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:53,059
...Brad Bellick's body goes home
to his mother.

30
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,733
All right, all right.

31
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,268
All right, I'm gonna take care
of the body.

32
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,907
But you guys need to get out
of mourning.

33
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:08,937
Okay, we need to get back to work.

34
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,443
We need to pack Brad's stuff up
and we need to get back to work.

35
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:16,141
And Fernando, my friend,
let me tell you something.

36
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:20,309
If you ever put your hands on me again,
I promise you, okay...

37
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,854
...there's gonna be two bodies
in the fridge.

38
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:24,286
But I need results.

39
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,552
Yeah, well, I need
to see those missing pages.

40
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:27,956
So, what's it gonna be?

41
00:02:39,674 --> 00:02:41,107
I heard you were dead.

42
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:42,834
Who told you that?

43
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:46,737
Little bird.

44
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:52,313
- Awfully generous of you.
- It's all a matter of timing.

45
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:55,817
The Company's moving Scylla
to a bunker in Pennsylvania.

46
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,014
- When?
- Tomorrow.

47
00:02:57,191 --> 00:03:00,627
You wanna make sure to mention that,
like on the phone, like right away?

48
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:04,663
For an ex-employee, you seem to know an
awful lot about current company business.

49
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,233
Don't get paranoid. I'm keeping one ear
to the ground for your benefit...

50
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:11,201
...which is a good reason to work with me
and not against me.

51
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:14,102
All right, you know what?
We got our pages. Let's go.

52
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,045
That's Enzen from Transpo.

53
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:30,452
He's responsible for the power transfer.

54
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,320
And you know Powell?

55
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:35,394
He's supervising the security override.

56
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:36,587
It's a big job.

57
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:38,891
Perhaps we should call in David Baker...

58
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:41,229
...just to be safe.

59
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:43,233
That won't be necessary.

60
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:47,106
We can do this all in-house.

61
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:50,300
And Scylla will be gone by morning.

62
00:03:57,552 --> 00:04:00,715
I promised Brad I would call his mom
if anything happened.

63
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,683
I'll do it, if you want.

64
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:06,886
No, it's okay. I'll do it.

65
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:09,257
Look at this.

66
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:12,562
He kept the badge
from the police benefit.

67
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,668
When he was a C.O. In Fox River...

68
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:19,204
...he failed the test
to get into the academy five times.

69
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:29,680
These are right, right?

70
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:32,649
This is a map
of the Company's basement, right?

71
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:35,285
I don't know. It looks too simple.

72
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:38,721
I assumed it would be
a lot more complicated than this.

73
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,220
The symbols, they're...

74
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:42,889
They don't make any sense.
And the letters...

75
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:45,962
There's just something wrong.

76
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:49,901
This letter C, it usually designates
some kind of heating vent.

77
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:52,963
The M designates a meter.

78
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:55,041
This is some sort of condensing unit.

79
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:57,541
This is a plumbing part.
It's called a P-trap.

80
00:04:57,712 --> 00:05:00,977
They're all completely dissimilar items.

81
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:05,313
Logical design dictates they'd never
be installed that randomly. It just...

82
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:06,778
...doesn't make sense.

83
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,947
C, M, E.

84
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:13,452
C, M, E.

85
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:16,461
C, M, E.

86
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:23,494
C, M, E.

87
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:24,695
That's, "see me."

88
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:27,773
These letters don't make sense
if you think of them as symbols.

89
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:30,206
But they do if you think of them literally.

90
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:32,772
Do you see me?
He's asking if you see him.

91
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:35,177
- Where?
- Here.

92
00:05:51,065 --> 00:05:52,828
David Baker.

93
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:56,592
But who besides you two
would come up with something like that?

94
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:59,001
I mean, what's the point?

95
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:02,838
I don't know. But we're never gonna
figure this blueprint out...

96
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,978
...if we can't find the person
who drew it.

97
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:09,010
We need David Baker.

98
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,796
- Hello, darling.
- Good morning.

99
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:59,592
Here is your coffee.
One sugar, two creams.

100
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:02,065
And those fingerprints you ordered.

101
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:04,033
- Gretchen's?
- Yes.

102
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:07,003
Gretchen Louise Morgan.

103
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:09,439
How'd you pull off a thing like that?

104
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,510
I have a friend who works with the chips.

105
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,943
But don't get too excited.
There's not much there.

106
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:17,775
"Gretchen Louise Morgan.

107
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:19,544
DOB: 3-29-77.

108
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,381
Johnstown, West Virginia.

109
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:23,148
Sister lives in Riverside.

110
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:25,053
Daddy, deceased.

111
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:29,355
Award-winning equestrian.
Iraqi war vet."

112
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,656
I'll be damned.

113
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,766
Clean-cut chick. At least on paper.

114
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:37,200
I don't see any evidence that
she's related to Chinese organized crime.

115
00:07:37,972 --> 00:07:39,030
No husband in Beijing?

116
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:42,073
- No prior arrests for extortion?
- No.

117
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:45,406
- No mention of any of our friends?
- I checked. No Scofield.

118
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,979
No Burrows. No Whistler.

119
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:49,740
Whistler?

120
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:55,052
- How do you know that name?
- James Whistler?

121
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:58,214
- I heard Scofield mention him one day.
- What day?

122
00:07:58,392 --> 00:07:59,723
The day that I met him.

123
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:01,486
In what context?

124
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:04,526
I don't remember.

125
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:07,059
Why, what's the big deal? Who is he?

126
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,460
Nobody.

127
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:14,966
That'll be all for now.

128
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:26,286
Here's another one, David Allen Baker.

129
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:28,319
Adviser to the city planning commission.

130
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:32,118
Won an award
for designing low-income housing.

131
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:35,262
Wife is named Elaine.
And there's the address.

132
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,056
I'll print a map.

133
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,433
We still need that sixth card, all right?

134
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:42,626
Really?

135
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,671
All right. We've got at least
30 more yards to go...

136
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,839
...past the water main
before we get to the Company building.

137
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:53,674
See that? That looks like it could be
some sort of obstruction in the tunnel.

138
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:57,011
Whatever it takes. We gotta get
through that in the next few hours.

139
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:59,618
I want you guys to go down there
and get started.

140
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:02,847
Sara and I will go look and look
for David Baker.

141
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:05,117
And Bellick gets back to his mom.

142
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,624
Yeah, and when we get Scylla...

143
00:09:08,062 --> 00:09:11,122
...we're walking away from this crap.
- Absolutely.

144
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:13,591
Sara?

145
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:21,368
Michael.

146
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,468
Michael.

147
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:34,320
I'm okay.

148
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:35,512
Get him in the car.

149
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,090
- Where are you gonna take him?
- Hospital.

150
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:40,921
- Let's not freak out. Calm down.
- This is my decision.

151
00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:43,529
- We're going to the hospital.
- What's wrong with him?

152
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:45,095
David Baker.

153
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,824
I'll go. I'll find him.

154
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:50,394
Don't forget to use fake ID
at the hospital.

155
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:52,198
- Shut the door.
- Okay.

156
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:06,182
Yeah, excellent.
Make sure you get that on my desk...

157
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:09,685
Mr. White.

158
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:11,791
If you'll allow me to be nosy...

159
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,826
...how long has Trishanne
been part of the organization?

160
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:18,522
Temp agency sent her over about a week
before you got here.

161
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:21,930
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a look at her application.

162
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:26,096
I always check out the background
of anyone who deals with my affairs.

163
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:29,467
- I understand. I'll talk to H.R.
- Thank you.

164
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:32,737
Cole, you know what?
Today around noon...

165
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:36,371
...I really need you
to step in for Andrew Blauner.

166
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,608
Host an intro.

167
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:41,585
New franchises from Idaho.
We gotta knock them out.

168
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:44,884
I'd like to see
some of that Cole Pfeiffer magic.

169
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:49,119
Abracadabra.

170
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:00,970
Excuse me, sir?

171
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:02,336
Are you a salesman?

172
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,673
Yes, indeedy, I am.
What can I do for you?

173
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:13,944
Cole, I can see that you're busy,
but I didn't want you to be the last to know.

174
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:15,281
Scylla is moving.

175
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,618
- Come back?
- Don't worry.

176
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,124
We're gonna stick to our original plan.

177
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:23,496
- What exactly is the plan?
- We wait.

178
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:25,689
- Wait?
- Yes.

179
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:29,603
- Okay, have you ever heard of noodling?
- I don't believe so.

180
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,863
Then what kind of hillbilly are you,
really?

181
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,939
I'll explain it to you.

182
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:38,545
Noodling is when a foolhardy bastard
swims to the bottom of a muddy riverbed...

183
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:42,239
...and he sticks his hand
down into the deepest, darkest hole.

184
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,111
He's looking for a prize catfish.

185
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:47,717
Now, sometimes,
the catfish does live there.

186
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:51,346
And the noodler pulls it out
with his bare hand and he drags it ashore.

187
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:55,222
But sometimes, he reaches in that hole
and he finds a snapping turtle.

188
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:56,658
Bites his hand clean off.

189
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:01,294
Scofield's your noodler.

190
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:04,968
Yes. And if he reaches into
the Company hole and he finds Scylla...

191
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:07,164
...we take it and we sell it to Feng.

192
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:09,969
If he gets a turtle, well...

193
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:13,043
...not our hand.

194
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:17,177
The contractors are here.

195
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:20,886
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a client.

196
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:22,545
- You're a client?
- Keep it down.

197
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:24,247
It's all part of the rules.

198
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:25,551
We need some help.

199
00:12:25,726 --> 00:12:29,457
I'm already providing my services,
white-collar style, all right?

200
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,097
Where's pretty and the fat man?

201
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:33,233
Bellick's dead.

202
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,062
Make a joke about it
and I'll rip your tongue out.

203
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:38,736
Let's go, Linc.

204
00:12:44,712 --> 00:12:47,476
Sorry to bother you. I'm an internist.
I brought my husband.

205
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:50,276
He's in and out of consciousness.
His symptoms concern me.

206
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:53,943
I'd be really grateful
if we could see a neurologist.

207
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,452
Does he have insurance?

208
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:59,525
Yeah. I don't have the card,
but I have his ID.

209
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:01,021
Here. Just fill this out.

210
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:02,958
Okay. Thank you.

211
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:06,265
Mr. Freeling?

212
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:08,198
Mr. Freeling?

213
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:11,065
Yes. Yes, that's me.

214
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:12,569
Is it always low?

215
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:16,542
A little.

216
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,043
Has anyone in your family ever
suffered from epilepsy, stroke, TIAs...

217
00:13:20,214 --> 00:13:22,478
...any neurological disorder?

218
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:25,244
My mom.

219
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,244
Okay.

220
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:31,781
Jimmy, take this gentleman back
to Bay 4.

221
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:37,991
Why are we relocating?

222
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:41,157
Scylla's security is the foundation
of this entire organization.

223
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:44,498
I realize that. But have you thought
about the ramifications?

224
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,304
We lose critical access.

225
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:49,499
It could compromise our timeline
on stage two.

226
00:13:53,514 --> 00:13:56,244
The plates and the facility
are ready to print...

227
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:59,250
...as much currency as we need
at any time.

228
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:02,614
But when will Scylla be installed
in Pennsylvania?

229
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,781
Lisa, what's our timeline?

230
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:08,361
Actually, there's been a bit of a problem.

231
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:12,689
Dismantling the security surrounding sill
is a bit tricky.

232
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:15,664
- It may take longer than we thought.
- How much longer?

233
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:19,028
I can make this happen right now.

234
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,833
<i>Yes, general?</i>

235
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,672
<i>- Go get David Baker.
- Yes, sir.</i>

236
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:34,978
Yes?

237
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:39,324
<i>Hello, I'm looking for a Mr. David Baker.</i>

238
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:42,394
He's not taking any new projects
right now.

239
00:14:43,197 --> 00:14:45,529
<i>Actually, I have some questions
about something...</i>

240
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,667
<i>... that he worked on a few years ago.</i>

241
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:51,202
<i>Are you familiar
with a project called Scylla?</i>

242
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,346
I'm working.

243
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:07,417
This man would like
to talk to you about Scylla.

244
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:10,889
You're Company?

245
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:12,654
Yes, sir.

246
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:14,794
I'm in logistics.

247
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:18,824
And I'd like to ask you some questions
about your original design.

248
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:23,762
Been a long time
since I thought about that.

249
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:25,962
Be lucky to remember anything.

250
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,767
Looks like you're pretty busy.

251
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:29,909
Do you mind if I take a look?

252
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:46,017
You know, Bellick saved my life.

253
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:47,626
What?

254
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:56,796
Back when we were in prison in Panama.

255
00:15:58,038 --> 00:15:59,869
T-Bag went crazy. He went nuts.

256
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:02,538
What happened?

257
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,108
He lit Sona on fire.

258
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:06,212
Told everyone to run.

259
00:16:06,513 --> 00:16:09,038
"They can't shoot us all," he said.

260
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,240
It was a stampede, bro.

261
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:14,115
I was down, getting trampled.
I couldn't get up.

262
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:17,155
I couldn't breathe.
I thought I was gonna die and...

263
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:21,656
But then something put me back
on my feet.

264
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,229
It was Bellick.

265
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:30,762
He saved my life.

266
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:10,106
That wall's gotta come down?

267
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:12,507
Unless you got a better idea.

268
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:14,579
Okay.

269
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,817
What was that?

270
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:27,916
I don't know.
I think I stepped on something.

271
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,060
What's going on, Linc?

272
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:41,134
I don't know.

273
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:51,412
It's some kind of explosive.

274
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:53,849
Explosive. Then shouldn't I be dead?

275
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:58,482
If you move, you will be.

276
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:13,698
They're underground.
You're not gonna be able to reach them.

277
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:17,542
Right.

278
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:21,643
And you know what?
They'll be fine without you.

279
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:23,945
Right.

280
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:26,113
You ever heard of Fox River?

281
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,950
Maybe we could talk about it over dinner.

282
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:32,216
I got a gift card to the Red Lobster
over off the interstate.

283
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:37,553
I never thought the guys would be so sad
for Brad Bellick.

284
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:40,859
A lot of things have changed
since Fox River.

285
00:18:43,237 --> 00:18:45,933
You know you can't control this, yeah?

286
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:49,736
That's funny. I was just about
to tell you the same thing.

287
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,106
Whatever it is, we can manage it.

288
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:56,875
Just need to know
what we're dealing with.

289
00:18:57,851 --> 00:19:00,251
What if I don't want to know?

290
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:05,617
Kevin Freeling?

291
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,108
Should only take a few minutes.

292
00:19:32,286 --> 00:19:35,119
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

293
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:52,802
My goal is to build one city
that entirely self-sustains.

294
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:55,271
Dependent on no outside resources.

295
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:58,172
A community living entirely in harmony.

296
00:19:58,345 --> 00:20:01,041
How close is it to becoming reality?

297
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:03,373
Well, it's a matter of opinion.

298
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,077
People look at something like this
and they think it's impossible.

299
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:10,214
In reality,
I could make it happen tomorrow.

300
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:12,584
Look what they built in Dubai.

301
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,661
Exactly. Grand ideas brought into reality.

302
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,726
This won't just serve the rich.

303
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:30,702
How long have you been working
for them?

304
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:36,246
Too long.

305
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,850
I came in in '94.

306
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:44,681
I was never good at collecting
a paycheck. Always freelance.

307
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:48,355
Partially retired all the time.

308
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:52,564
I like to finish a job and then move on.

309
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,758
Put it in the past.

310
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:58,231
You always leave your name behind?

311
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:01,505
Instead of the correct specifications?

312
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:04,067
Only on the Scylla project.

313
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:06,612
Well, we're considering modifications...

314
00:21:07,547 --> 00:21:10,277
...and I was hoping
that you would help me...

315
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,419
...figure out what should really appear
on those blueprints.

316
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:16,852
As of right now,
they don't mean much.

317
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:19,686
Didn't you read the legend?

318
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,527
Sure.

319
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,859
But we still had a lot of trouble.

320
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:31,133
You're not Company.

321
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:37,641
What should I do?

322
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:39,206
- Stay calm.
- Calm?

323
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:41,711
- I'm standing on a bomb.
- We'll work it out.

324
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:47,385
You think Gretchen set us up?

325
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:03,368
Lessons taught by our founder, Mr...

326
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:05,263
...Harvey Hall.

327
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:10,239
The pathway to personal freedom...

328
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,139
Do people actually buy this nonsense?

329
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:19,348
- Let go of me.
- You're coming with me...

330
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,316
...or through that glass. Choose.

331
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:23,820
This is a place of business.

332
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:37,627
GATE allows us to find the pathway
to personal freedom.

333
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:41,499
Define our boundaries.

334
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:43,633
See past them.

335
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,747
Let me tell you a story
about the founder of this great program.

336
00:22:55,622 --> 00:23:01,561
You know, I'm gonna tell you a better story
about captivity than the regular old spiel.

337
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:08,097
Years back,
I was providing volunteer leadership...

338
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:10,600
...in a local penitentiary.

339
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:13,706
I worked with the head guard...

340
00:23:13,874 --> 00:23:16,809
...a big, burly bull named Brad.

341
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:18,001
Mean as the devil.

342
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:19,907
All the prisoners were afraid of him.

343
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,206
Even the murderers.

344
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:26,143
And one day, Brad said to me,
"Cole, I want you to get out of here.

345
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,911
I want you to get out of here now.

346
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:30,886
Because I can tell
you're a man who loves freedom."

347
00:23:31,057 --> 00:23:33,685
And I said,
"Well, what about you, Brad?

348
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,884
What about you?"

349
00:23:35,362 --> 00:23:39,696
He said, "Well, yeah,
I'm gonna be free someday when I retire."

350
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:46,965
I recently got the news
that he had passed away.

351
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:49,675
And where was he?

352
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:53,441
Still in that prison.

353
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:58,050
Still in the captivity of negativity.

354
00:24:07,394 --> 00:24:08,452
Sorry, folks.

355
00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:18,503
Old Brad.

356
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:29,375
<i>As my papi used to say:</i>

357
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:33,348
<i>"Stand by, your glasses steady</i>

358
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,819
<i>And drink to your comrade's eyes.</i>

359
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,255
<i>Here's a toast to the dead already</i>

360
00:24:40,427 --> 00:24:44,227
<i>And hurrah for the next to die."</i>

361
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:49,464
I needed to make sure
I'd have access to your test results.

362
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:52,969
So I told the triage nurse
that I was your wife.

363
00:24:57,043 --> 00:24:58,510
Has a nice ring.

364
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:02,748
Are you Kevin Freeling?

365
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,179
Yes. I am.

366
00:25:05,352 --> 00:25:06,979
I'm Dr. Malden. I'm a neurologist.

367
00:25:07,153 --> 00:25:08,814
- And you are?
- Cameron Eberline.

368
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:11,014
I'm an internist. Do you have the results?

369
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:12,818
It's gonna take a little while.

370
00:25:12,993 --> 00:25:15,985
Looking at the family history,
I'd like to admit you here.

371
00:25:16,162 --> 00:25:19,290
We're working on a room. Just for now,
till we get the test results.

372
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:21,093
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

373
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:24,202
It would be best if you could rest
where you could be monitored.

374
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:27,772
After that, we'll determine
what the best course of action is. Agreed?

375
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:29,374
I think we have to go. Sorry.

376
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:32,670
Hold on, hold on. How long will it take
to get the results?

377
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:35,371
Couple hours.
But we'll get you in a room before then.

378
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:37,116
- Just wait here.
- Thank you.

379
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:39,983
Come on.

380
00:25:49,195 --> 00:25:52,687
You know what happens. They take over
your life. You don't own it anymore.

381
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:54,766
That is not what happened to me.

382
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:57,494
Then somehow,
you stayed out of trouble.

383
00:25:57,671 --> 00:26:00,139
You did what they told you to do.

384
00:26:01,608 --> 00:26:03,633
Maybe that's why you stuck around,
huh?

385
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,744
Right here in Los Angeles.

386
00:26:06,012 --> 00:26:07,741
In my case, they had something on me.

387
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:09,905
And they used it.
And they never let me go.

388
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:13,985
They've killed hundreds, thousands
of people in the pursuit of power.

389
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:15,246
You know that.

390
00:26:15,422 --> 00:26:17,822
We lost a good man yesterday
trying to stop them.

391
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:19,515
They hurt a lot of people, David.

392
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:22,827
- David.
- Look...

393
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,589
...I stay out of the politics.

394
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:27,426
It was a job.

395
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,727
I specialized in security engineering.

396
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:32,167
Scylla was a choice assignment,
so I took it.

397
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:34,329
They told you what it was, didn't they?

398
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:35,735
They told you what it was.

399
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:39,401
Now you wish you'd never helped them,
but you're trapped like I was.

400
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:42,207
- You talk like it's all in the present.
- It is.

401
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:53,183
I know you wanna move on. I'm...

402
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,520
Look what you're doing.
Trying to make up for something?

403
00:26:56,696 --> 00:26:58,721
Forget the charitable city of the future.

404
00:26:58,898 --> 00:27:01,366
Worry about the world
that you live in right now.

405
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:04,526
What they did,
what they're doing, is not my fault.

406
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:15,344
You put your name in there for a reason.
You wanted someone to find you.

407
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:20,316
And if you tell me what I need to know,
I can do something for both of us.

408
00:27:22,355 --> 00:27:24,482
Where's your husband?

409
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:26,557
Running errands.
He should be right back.

410
00:27:26,726 --> 00:27:29,354
That's his car in the driveway, isn't it?

411
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:32,123
Just a moment.
I'll go call him on his cell.

412
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:35,730
- Excuse me!
- Backup request at southeast door.

413
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:45,401
You knew about this, didn't you?

414
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:48,474
First of all, I have no idea...

415
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:52,675
...why the Company would put an explosive
of any kind underneath their own building.

416
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:55,787
- We're under the courtyard.
- You know, I honestly had no idea...

417
00:27:55,955 --> 00:27:58,355
...that any of this was even here.

418
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:03,762
That being said...

419
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:09,433
...these look a lot like JZ33
anti-personnel blast mines.

420
00:28:10,203 --> 00:28:15,266
<i>Back in Fallujah, the muj used
to bury them outside their firm base.</i>

421
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:17,068
Well, get rid of them.

422
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:20,836
Well, I'm no expert, but I have an idea.

423
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:24,108
- What's beeping?
- It beeps.

424
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:28,119
Wow, you must have stepped
on this just right.

425
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:31,252
Your weight is evenly distributed
across the pressure plate.

426
00:28:31,424 --> 00:28:33,255
And you haven't engaged the firing pin.

427
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:34,552
You can't move an inch.

428
00:28:34,894 --> 00:28:37,124
We know. What's your idea?

429
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:38,992
My idea is that he moves an inch.

430
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:41,497
I can get to the hole
and dismantle the firing pin.

431
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:43,795
- He's standing on it. I can't do anything.
- No.

432
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:45,402
No, no, no, Linc:

433
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,531
- What?
- Call your brother, please.

434
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:51,609
You, you stay here.

435
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:53,177
Fine.

436
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:57,380
- It's my brother.
- Michael.

437
00:28:58,484 --> 00:29:00,213
Let's go.

438
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:04,713
Sara.

439
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:06,654
Not leaving, are you?

440
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:08,293
You have our number.

441
00:29:08,494 --> 00:29:10,394
- Who are you?
- He prefers to wait at home.

442
00:29:10,597 --> 00:29:12,189
- I'm monitoring.
- He's leaving...

443
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:14,230
...in a potentially fragile condition.

444
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,300
Look, I'm not stupid.

445
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:18,994
I know who you are.
And I'm not gonna turn you in.

446
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:21,868
My concern is for what's going on
with your health.

447
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:25,501
They aren't here for you.
And in your condition...

448
00:29:25,678 --> 00:29:27,612
Thank you, doctor.
I appreciate your help.

449
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:30,239
Please do call us.

450
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:38,751
Can I help you?

451
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:50,126
I messed up.

452
00:29:50,803 --> 00:29:52,100
What do you mean?

453
00:29:52,272 --> 00:29:54,103
Today, I was working with Bagwell.

454
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:55,741
He's been compliant as hell.

455
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:59,106
I thought I'd make him happy.
He wanted to talk about Gretchen.

456
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,975
- Right. And what happened?
- And I slipped up.

457
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:03,410
I mentioned Whistler.

458
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:05,710
This one is tough. I'm telling you.

459
00:30:05,885 --> 00:30:08,718
Bagwell, Gretchen Morgan.
They're thugs.

460
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:12,949
I have been faced down with a gun
to the back of my head more than once.

461
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:19,723
All right.

462
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:23,396
Look, I don't want you to do something
that you don't wanna do.

463
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:25,469
You're a good agent.
We could reassign...

464
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:27,469
No. No, that is not it.

465
00:30:27,774 --> 00:30:30,140
Look, I can handle this. I'm just...

466
00:30:30,877 --> 00:30:32,469
I'm just kicking myself.

467
00:30:33,446 --> 00:30:35,414
I could find something else for you to do.

468
00:30:35,581 --> 00:30:38,482
This thing's gotten way out of hand.
Dallow's on my back.

469
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:41,313
- And the Company is moving Scylla.
- No.

470
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:43,355
I'm fine.

471
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:46,082
Are you sure?

472
00:30:48,027 --> 00:30:50,495
I really think we can do this, Don.

473
00:30:50,663 --> 00:30:53,257
We can bring the Company down.

474
00:30:55,768 --> 00:30:58,896
Ego is the only reason
I coded my name into those blueprints.

475
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,699
I don't feel guilty about anything.

476
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:02,934
I gotta take this. I'm sorry.

477
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:04,133
Hello?

478
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,743
<i>Alex, we got a problem.</i>

479
00:31:05,912 --> 00:31:07,004
<i>- What?
- We got a problem.</i>

480
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,580
There's a damn minefield down there.

481
00:31:10,116 --> 00:31:11,515
Hello, I can't hear you.

482
00:31:11,684 --> 00:31:12,708
<i>Sucre's in trouble.</i>

483
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:14,147
He's standing on a mine.

484
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,618
We need to deactivate it.

485
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,328
Linc, I gotta go. I'll call you back.

486
00:31:22,495 --> 00:31:23,792
What?

487
00:31:24,564 --> 00:31:26,225
They're here, David.

488
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:29,795
- What do they want?
- They're moving Scylla, protecting it.

489
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:33,063
Everything you did for them,
they want you to do it again.

490
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:34,672
You think you can stop them?

491
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:35,865
I know all about you.

492
00:31:36,342 --> 00:31:38,003
I've known about you for six months.

493
00:31:38,177 --> 00:31:40,441
Since somebody stole
those plans from the Company.

494
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:43,514
It will never work.
You won't get past the first wall.

495
00:31:43,683 --> 00:31:47,050
What about the first wall?
What's gonna stop me, huh? The minefield?

496
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,349
Please.

497
00:31:53,526 --> 00:31:54,925
Don't tell them.

498
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:09,507
Got him. Sweep the area.

499
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:41,465
There's a dirt road
at the bottom of the hill.

500
00:32:41,641 --> 00:32:43,268
- It'll take you out.
- Your husband...

501
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:45,411
Just go.
He won't help you. That will.

502
00:32:52,718 --> 00:32:55,050
Linc, go call him again.

503
00:32:55,688 --> 00:32:58,156
Linc, go call him. Linc, go call him.

504
00:32:58,324 --> 00:32:59,916
What will Michael know about this?

505
00:33:00,093 --> 00:33:02,618
I mean, it's not exactly
within his realm of expertise.

506
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:05,662
We're wasting time.
I gave you a semi-professional assessment.

507
00:33:05,932 --> 00:33:08,400
What's wrong?
You don't trust me, Fernando?

508
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:11,495
Why should he?

509
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:14,504
Because we all want the same thing,
Scylla.

510
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:17,541
I won't let a giant pack
of firecrackers stand in our way.

511
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,611
Or would you like me
to call the bomb squad?

512
00:33:21,848 --> 00:33:24,442
Look, I am offering to do you
a massive favor here.

513
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:28,519
If that thing blows while I'm pulling the pin,
he loses a leg. I loose a face.

514
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,823
Now, don't worry, Fernando.

515
00:33:36,796 --> 00:33:39,458
I'm known for my steady hand.

516
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:44,493
Take a deep breath, okay?

517
00:33:45,605 --> 00:33:47,266
Keep your weight even.

518
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:52,135
And I need you to shift slowly,
very slowly...

519
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:55,940
...one inch to your left,
so I can get to the pin.

520
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:59,848
No, no, I can't. I can't. I can't do it.

521
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:02,983
You all right?

522
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,017
Have you heard anything?

523
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:07,489
They have to deactivate.

524
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,720
I got a key, a legend to the blueprint.

525
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:11,989
Baker gave you this?

526
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:15,328
No, his wife gave it to me.
They came for Baker.

527
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:18,334
All right, well, this makes more sense.

528
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:21,936
These symbols aren't for P-traps.

529
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:25,635
They're... They're microphones.

530
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:28,405
And the letter V isn't for vacuum.

531
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:31,308
That's the generator.

532
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:38,755
This is a line of JZ33 land mines,
buried 80 millimeters underground...

533
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:43,528
...about 7 feet from the outer wall.
That must be what Linc was talking about.

534
00:34:45,698 --> 00:34:49,225
It says, "manual override only.

535
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:53,600
All conventional attempts to dismantle
the JZ33 will activate the Scylla alarms."

536
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:58,667
This isn't just a land mine. This is...

537
00:34:59,478 --> 00:35:01,503
This is an alarm.

538
00:35:02,915 --> 00:35:04,974
We can't sit here all night.

539
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:07,109
Okay?

540
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:10,783
You ready?

541
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:28,640
<i>Hey, it's Linc. You know what to do.</i>

542
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,809
What are you doing?

543
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:57,133
Linc?

544
00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:59,637
Sucre!

545
00:36:05,378 --> 00:36:07,403
Stop. Stop!

546
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,515
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.

547
00:36:13,686 --> 00:36:16,780
You can't dismantle the land mine
without setting off the alarm.

548
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:19,083
- So I either set off the alarm or die.
- No.

549
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:21,356
There's a manual override.

550
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:26,423
It will cut the power long enough
for you to step off...

551
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,658
...without removing the pin.

552
00:36:29,268 --> 00:36:32,431
- How do you know for sure?
- I found David Baker.

553
00:36:39,712 --> 00:36:40,770
Sucre, step off.

554
00:36:42,214 --> 00:36:44,944
You can do it.
You only have 20 seconds. Come on.

555
00:36:45,117 --> 00:36:46,880
- I can't...
- Yes, you can.

556
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:49,283
Michael and I figured it out.
Step off right now.

557
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:52,481
No, you guys all go.
We all don't have to die. I'll do it alone.

558
00:36:52,658 --> 00:36:55,752
Nobody's gonna die today. Step off!

559
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:01,190
Step off.

560
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:41,935
What's behind this wall?

561
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:44,937
Scylla.

562
00:38:09,668 --> 00:38:10,896
When do you find out?

563
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:15,038
The doctor's supposed to call...

564
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:16,732
...any minute.

565
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:18,399
Look...

566
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:21,911
...l'm sorry I wasn't there for you today.

567
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:24,949
Don't worry about it.

568
00:38:25,117 --> 00:38:28,712
You know, what Gretchen did for Sucre
made me realize we can use her.

569
00:38:28,888 --> 00:38:30,583
I asked for the sixth key.

570
00:38:30,756 --> 00:38:32,587
What'd she say?

571
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:34,717
She's on it.

572
00:38:44,236 --> 00:38:46,932
You all right? All right.

573
00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:50,075
I'm about to go to the airfield,
ship Brad's body to his mother.

574
00:38:50,242 --> 00:38:51,573
We've got his things here.

575
00:38:51,744 --> 00:38:53,006
Where is he?

576
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:55,373
Over here.

577
00:39:50,536 --> 00:39:52,970
His mom will appreciate that.

578
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:18,720
Mrs. Bellick...

579
00:40:18,898 --> 00:40:21,162
...this is Fernando Sucre.

580
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:34,206
Great job today.

581
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,348
I'm sorry to hear about your friend.

582
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:38,346
But that's admirable work...

583
00:40:38,517 --> 00:40:41,111
...volunteering with a bunch
of criminals like that.

584
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:43,346
We're all the same, really.

585
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,182
Here's the application
you requested for the desk girl.

586
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:49,952
You have a good night, Cole.

587
00:40:50,629 --> 00:40:51,891
You too. Thanks.

588
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,214
Hello.

589
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:22,092
<i>Hello?</i>

590
00:41:25,764 --> 00:41:29,131
Okay. We will. Thank you.

591
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:31,098
As we've all learned the hard way...

592
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:37,140
...there's an electronic alarm barrier
around the perimeter of the foundation.

593
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:41,803
Unfortunately that is Scylla's
most primitive line of defense.

594
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:46,351
The wall itself is fortified with steel fiber.

595
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:51,086
The good news is, on the inside here,
there are no cameras.

596
00:41:52,424 --> 00:41:55,393
The Company doesn't want
any visual evidence that Scylla exists.

597
00:41:55,561 --> 00:42:01,158
The bad news is that there are both weight
and microphonic sensors here and here...

598
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,096
...that will alert Company security...

599
00:42:03,268 --> 00:42:08,296
...to the presence of any breathing human
being that weighs more than 2 pounds.

600
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,944
As far as I can tell...

601
00:42:13,846 --> 00:42:16,542
...the first challenge
is getting around that wall...

602
00:42:16,715 --> 00:42:19,878
...and then we can worry about
crossing the floor.

603
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:22,043
Without touching it.

604
00:42:22,221 --> 00:42:24,052
In silence.

605
00:42:24,657 --> 00:42:26,124
It's complicated.

606
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:29,385
But I'm already working on something.

607
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:35,634
Brad didn't die in vain.

608
00:42:36,602 --> 00:42:38,194
We can make this work.

609
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:51,542
That was the neurologist.

610
00:42:52,451 --> 00:42:54,851
You have a hypothalamus hamartoma.

611
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,319
It's really rare.
You were probably born with it.

612
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,990
Things have changed.
It's been growing...

613
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:05,062
...which is why you've been experiencing
your symptoms.

614
00:43:05,597 --> 00:43:08,464
And the doctor feels
that you need surgery.

615
00:43:09,535 --> 00:43:12,402
Two days. That's what I need.

616
00:43:12,971 --> 00:43:14,268
Tomorrow.

617
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:17,699
Otherwise you could die
and there's no alternative.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
