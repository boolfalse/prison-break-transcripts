1
00:00:00,671 --> 00:00:01,671
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:04,172
Your mother works for us.

3
00:00:04,473 --> 00:00:05,473
Your mother is alive.

4
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:08,174
<i>You know, I'm thinking
more and more that</i>

5
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,398
this is an inside job.
- Why?

6
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:10,880
<i>The hardware</i>
<i>he brought to the meet.</i>

7
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:12,638
<i>He could read Scylla</i>
<i>right on the spot.</i>

8
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:17,503
Hands on your head.

9
00:00:17,577 --> 00:00:20,216
We've got to get
out of here!

10
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:21,701
Get in!

11
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,854
Sorry, but right now
I want my life back

12
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:27,848
more than I want your money.

13
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:28,952
Where's Scylla?

14
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:30,623
Let's talk about
that, okay?

15
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,684
Where is he?

16
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:32,622
I can get him.

17
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:33,529
No, he can't.

18
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:34,659
He's stalling, Linc.

19
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,862
He's gone.
- You're right.

20
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:41,899
You have no idea who this guy's working for?
- No.

21
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:42,970
No clue.

22
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:46,372
Your boy's dead.

23
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:47,400
And now

24
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:48,869
I'm coming after you.

25
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,509
Who was that?

26
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:55,349
It was my son.

27
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:57,083
Lincoln.

28
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,030
What is this?

29
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:12,426
I don't know...

30
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,925
Just found them
on the doorstep.

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,977
Son of a...

32
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:25,584
They lay one hand on my mama,
I swear on my life...

33
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:27,720
She's in a state home.

34
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:29,592
I thought we were working
with these people.

35
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:30,907
So did I.

36
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:33,352
I'm gonna make a call.

37
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:35,526
Find out what's going on.

38
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:43,056
Mr. Burrows.

39
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:44,395
We had a deal.

40
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:47,902
Our deal is contingent
upon the retrieval of Scylla.

41
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:50,428
Based on the mediocrity
of your performance

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,005
on that front thus far,

43
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:55,803
I thought it best to make sure
you're all properly motivated.

44
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,347
Just tell me
how your team is progressing.

45
00:01:58,413 --> 00:01:59,777
I swear to God, man, when I,

46
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:01,083
when I get a hold of you...

47
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:02,175
If I were you,

48
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,785
I'd be doing
everything in my power

49
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:06,075
to demonstrate
my competence right now.

50
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:10,219
We killed the guy
who came to Miami.

51
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,427
We found some keys on him.

52
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,853
We're looking into them.

53
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:15,193
Are we done?

54
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:16,362
Not quite.

55
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,756
A new competitor

56
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,324
has joined the search.

57
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,665
We're the ones getting Scylla.

58
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:21,996
Well, that's good to hear,

59
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:25,336
because the competing party,
is your brother Michael.

60
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,734
Michael's with you.

61
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,797
Michael's getting treatment.

62
00:02:32,873 --> 00:02:34,467
With you.
Apparently Michael's

63
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:37,173
a little more headstrong
than either of us imagined.

64
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:38,507
But don't worry.

65
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:41,655
We have a lead on him
somewhere in central Arizona.

66
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,476
Mr. Oren is waiting
in his limousine.

67
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:46,681
If you speak to Michael,

68
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,611
tell him to find
a very good hiding place.

69
00:02:48,688 --> 00:02:50,851
Because if any
of my men spot him,

70
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:53,198
they've been given
a green light.

71
00:02:57,998 --> 00:03:00,822
2,500 miles to go.

72
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:02,433
If we take turns sleeping

73
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:03,973
we can be there
by tomorrow night.

74
00:03:04,023 --> 00:03:06,108
Should we call Lincoln?
Let him know we're coming?

75
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:10,332
Michael, he took
the Company's deal

76
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:12,969
to save your life.

77
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,248
And for what it's worth,
I might've done the same thing.

78
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:17,314
Then you'd be wrong, too.

79
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:33,662
You know, this promises to be
a really, really long ride.

80
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:36,460
So, how about we just...

81
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,655
Call truce, all right?

82
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:43,521
Forgot napkins.

83
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,363
Come on.

84
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:49,316
He comes anywhere
near my kid...

85
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:51,116
You know, Don,

86
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:53,821
you seem to be taking
this whole thing pretty well.

87
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,524
Yeah, well,
I'm a pretty calm guy.

88
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:56,757
All I'm saying is,

89
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:58,493
my mama, his son, his wife.

90
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:00,460
We don't even know
who they got on you.

91
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:01,722
That's 'cause it's
none of your business.

92
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:02,763
All right, all you
need to worry about

93
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:03,965
is that I'm here
to do a job.

94
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:05,398
Hold-Secure.

95
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,170
The company that
manufactures the keys.

96
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:09,033
It's called Hold-Secure.
Listen to this.

97
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:11,242
Each key they produce is
implanted with a computer chip.

98
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:12,632
That chip sends out
a unique

99
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,206
electronic signal
that opens its lock.

100
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,736
Something that high-tech,

101
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,608
I'm telling you,
I'm betting they got a database

102
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:19,138
that'll tell us exactly
where each key's

103
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:20,978
corresponding lock
has been installed.

104
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:22,718
Look at that.

105
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:25,555
These keys run about 500 bucks?!

106
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:27,382
You only spend that
kind of money if you're

107
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:29,892
protecting something
of vital importance.

108
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:31,460
Like Scylla.

109
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:41,603
Someone just tried to access

110
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:43,308
Carruth's account
at Hold-Secure.

111
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:45,802
And what information
was compromised?

112
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:47,129
We don't know yet.

113
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:48,771
And who was trying to access it?

114
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:50,160
We don't know.

115
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:52,837
Thank you for bringing that
to my attention. Good work.

116
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:57,074
Yes?

117
00:05:57,134 --> 00:05:58,612
It's your son.

118
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:01,778
We already have safeguards
in place to deal with Lincoln.

119
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:04,143
I'm talking about Michael.

120
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:06,113
He's escaped Company custody.

121
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:09,822
He's coming
to Miami right now.

122
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:13,856
Christina?

123
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:17,528
If only they understood
what it is I'm trying to do.

124
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:25,396
Thank you very much.

125
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:28,039
Thanks.

126
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:33,513
Okay, what now?

127
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,573
We'll think of something.

128
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:37,204
Michael, we can't
afford to buy a car

129
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,812
and we can't fly.

130
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:45,051
It's time to call
your brother.

131
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:50,787
Got it.

132
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,920
We've got the locations
of those two locks.

133
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:54,168
One's in Little Havana.

134
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,623
The other one's
down by the water.

135
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:57,393
Perfect. Lincoln,
why don't you and I...

136
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:59,761
You take Self and
go to Little Havana.

137
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,027
We're gonna head south.

138
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:02,303
Huh, that's a surprise.

139
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,102
We need suntan lotion.

140
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,127
Be right there.

141
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:13,537
It's me.

142
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:14,808
What's your problem?

143
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:16,839
Look, I need you to hear me out
on this, Linc.

144
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:18,717
Everything was all set up
and you blew it.

145
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,849
You couldn't just
let me handle this, could you?

146
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:23,247
If by "handle," you mean
give Scylla back to the General,

147
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:25,028
then no, I couldn't.

148
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:26,984
It's more complicated than that.

149
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,291
Actually, it's not.

150
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,348
Listen to me,

151
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:30,499
I want my life back

152
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:32,299
and this is the only way
we can do that!

153
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:33,953
I don't believe that's true.

154
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:35,202
You know what, man?

155
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,455
You need to grow up.

156
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:39,233
Look, if that's how
you really feel, Linc,

157
00:07:39,306 --> 00:07:41,705
I should warn you I'm going
to do everything in my power

158
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,337
to stop you.

159
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,666
Listen to me:
I had a deal with the General.

160
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:47,375
You blew it.

161
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,703
He finds you,
he's gonna kill you.

162
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:51,569
Surprise, surprise.

163
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,732
I did this for us, Michael.

164
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,279
You, me, Sara,

165
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:57,736
LJ, so you could be with Sara.

166
00:07:57,813 --> 00:07:59,919
Two seconds,
just think of your family.

167
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:01,214
Feels like family's
the only thing

168
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:03,423
I can think about these days.

169
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,054
What does that mean?

170
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:06,326
Michael?

171
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:09,925
Linc, Mom is alive.

172
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:13,989
What?

173
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,430
Guess I'll see you in Miami.

174
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,572
We gotta get out of here.

175
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:22,401
Sir, you mind if I ask
where you're going?

176
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:23,567
Dallas.

177
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,140
Mind if we hitch a ride?

178
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,605
I got 100 bucks; gas money.

179
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:29,908
Please?

180
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:31,450
Sir?

181
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,108
Cab's not big enough
for the two of you.

182
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,249
If you want to
ride together

183
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,312
you're going to have
to ride back here.

184
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:45,952
Done.

185
00:08:57,728 --> 00:08:58,764
Get comfortable.

186
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:00,499
Gonna be eight hours
till we stop again.

187
00:09:32,663 --> 00:09:33,967
Linc...

188
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,128
If Scylla really is in there,
there's gonna be security.

189
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:37,632
I need you focused.

190
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,337
Yeah.

191
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:39,353
Clear upstairs.

192
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,248
You find something?

193
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:44,185
Picture of my mom.

194
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:46,053
Someone must have known
I was coming.

195
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:51,632
Someone who's connected enough
to be working with Carruth

196
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,021
and who knows you well enough

197
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,093
to get their hands
on that picture.

198
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:57,062
There's only one person
I can think of

199
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,863
that fits that description.

200
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:00,565
You're saying
my mom's in Miami?

201
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,967
If she was operating
out of this house,

202
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,473
she certainly had
access to money.

203
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:05,469
She's a Company agent.

204
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:06,830
Gretchen said she thought

205
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:09,573
that this could be
an inside job.

206
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:11,247
Linc...

207
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:12,936
Your mother could have Scylla.

208
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:21,732
<i>She used to bake cookies
<i>when we'd come home</i>

209
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:24,202
from school,

210
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:27,444
play kickball with us
in the backyard.

211
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,246
There's just no way
that woman was a Company agent.

212
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,807
You did read her file,
didn't you?

213
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:36,992
I saw medical reports

214
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:40,612
that said she had the
same diagnosis I did

215
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:42,724
and that Company
doctors operated

216
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:45,655
on her, too.

217
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:47,222
Now I'm wondering
if they took her off

218
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:51,060
to a log cabin in the woods
after they were done,

219
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,626
introduced her
to a friendly shrink.

220
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:59,136
How else could someone
just stand by and watch

221
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,209
while their own children
were hunted down like dogs?

222
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:06,172
Maybe she didn't know.

223
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,387
She knew.

224
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,418
Maybe it was over her head.

225
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:15,720
Or maybe she didn't care.

226
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:19,150
Anyway, I'm just surprised

227
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:22,248
the General waited so long
to drop this bomb on us.

228
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,249
Actually, I think
that part makes sense.

229
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:27,124
I mean,
for whatever reason,

230
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:29,192
your mother didn't want you
to know she was alive

231
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:31,594
or you would have known
years ago.

232
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:34,636
The General was just keeping
that secret, right?

233
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:37,863
Keeping her happy,
keeping her working.

234
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:40,535
But now the game has changed.

235
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:44,547
Yeah, now he thinks
you might be useful.

236
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:46,807
Just like Mom.

237
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,980
<i>Beyond question, he possesses</i>
<i>the most gifted mind</i>

238
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:55,414
of any man
I've ever encountered.

239
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,315
Well, I'll try not to
take that too personally.

240
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:02,453
He drilled
into your office safe

241
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,325
and copied your card
without you even noticing.

242
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:09,527
As I recall, you were sitting
right next to me.

243
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:12,900
If we could have turned
Michael Scofield,

244
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:15,568
it would have been like having
30 more years of Christina.

245
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:18,767
Pull over.

246
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,741
That's my ride.

247
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:27,346
What's going on?

248
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,245
Good-bye, Jonathan.

249
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,514
This ain't the place.

250
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,715
I could pick

251
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:15,917
that lock with my stump.
- No, n-no, n-no.

252
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:19,328
Remember what they say
about books and their covers.

253
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:21,127
When Harry Winston
donated the Hope Diamond

254
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:23,491
to the Smithsonian, you know
how he got it from New York

255
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:25,419
to DC?

256
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:27,267
Registered mail.

257
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,922
It's the safest way to go.

258
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,729
After all,
who is going to be looking

259
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:33,928
for the Hope Diamond
at the post office, right?

260
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,301
And who would be looking
for Scylla

261
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:37,901
at some run-down
storefront church

262
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:39,037
in Little Havana?

263
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:40,238
All right, let's
say you're right:

264
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:42,150
they got Scylla
back there somewhere.

265
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,742
You walk in there,
reeking that cop stink,

266
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:46,043
you won't last
a second.

267
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:48,916
That's a good point.

268
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:50,355
That's why you're going in.

269
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,233
May I help you?

270
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes, as a matter of fact.

271
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:11,956
I'm Charles Patoshik.

272
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:14,235
I'm a professor
of anthropology

273
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:16,111
at Southern Florida
University.

274
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:18,871
I'm doing some various research
on various different kinds

275
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:21,969
of, uh, uh, uh,
Caribbean religions, and, uh...

276
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:23,240
perhaps you could start

277
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:26,884
back there where you, you
do your, uh, services.

278
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,114
That is our sanctuary.

279
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:31,848
Only the pure of soul

280
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:33,583
may venture
inside.

281
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:34,584
I know.

282
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,976
I-I have been
in many such rooms.

283
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:39,287
Let me see your hand.

284
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:55,331
Your soul is black,

285
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,932
stained with the blood
of the innocent.

286
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:00,784
I cannot let you pass.

287
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:05,377
I have never been
so offended in my life.

288
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:13,385
I suggest that you continue
your research

289
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:16,389
elsewhere.

290
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,962
If you drop
something

291
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:29,705
by accident,

292
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:31,766
you leave a fingerprint
on it.

293
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,817
She wanted you
to find this.

294
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:36,714
Why?
- You ever seen it before?

295
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:38,540
No.

296
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:39,540
Do you remember

297
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:40,747
anything about that day?

298
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:41,855
I was four years old.

299
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:45,161
Any idea where
it was taken?

300
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:47,759
No.

301
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:50,387
Hey.

302
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:53,159
You okay?

303
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:55,265
I mean, if I found out my mom was...
- Listen,

304
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:56,994
as far as I'm concerned,
she's not my mom.

305
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:58,364
She's just someone
in the way of my freedom.

306
00:16:58,437 --> 00:16:59,440
All right?

307
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,441
<i>So, on my sixth birthday,</i>

308
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:14,488
um, my father was
long gone by then,

309
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:16,749
so it was just me,
Mom, and Linc, and...

310
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:18,417
Mom hands me my present--

311
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:21,453
my, uh, my only present--
and I just know...

312
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:25,090
I just know it's the
Millennium Falcon.

313
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,759
With the battle alert sound?

314
00:17:26,821 --> 00:17:27,858
Exactly.

315
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,871
I totally owned that.
- Of course you did.

316
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:32,271
Anyway, I had been asking
for this thing for weeks,

317
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:34,439
and the package is just
the right size, and...

318
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:35,871
I rip open the
wrapping paper

319
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:39,631
and... it's a birdhouse.

320
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:40,911
Oh, no.

321
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:43,576
Oh, yeah, except
it's not even a birdhouse.

322
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:45,445
It's actually a
birdhouse kit.

323
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,580
I'm so sorry.

324
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:51,315
I didn't talk to her
for two days after that,

325
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:54,496
but when she finally got
me to open the thing,

326
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:55,920
we sat there
together,

327
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:57,862
put it together
piece by piece,

328
00:17:57,928 --> 00:17:59,799
and it was the first
thing I ever built.

329
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:05,127
And I loved it...

330
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:07,462
and she knew I would.

331
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:09,834
She knew me better
than I knew myself.

332
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:11,769
That's what moms do.

333
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:14,470
Yeah, but the strange thing
is...

334
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,341
even though I haven't seen her
for 23 years,

335
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:17,415
there's this part of me

336
00:18:17,474 --> 00:18:21,886
that feels
like maybe she still does.

337
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:59,391
Your truck looks
a little low to the ground.

338
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:00,385
You mind
stepping outside?

339
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:02,488
I just got weighed
20 miles back.

340
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:05,029
You highway patrol?

341
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:09,335
Where are you going?

342
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:23,535
You've got no
business in there.

343
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:24,688
Unless you show me
a warrant,

344
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,779
you get the hell out of there
right now.

345
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:39,024
Thank you.

346
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:43,722
Goodness.

347
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:46,603
I got my weigh station ticket

348
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:48,259
right here on the dash.

349
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:50,035
As soon as you see that...

350
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:53,037
You'll see I got it right here.

351
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:57,953
Here you go.

352
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:02,271
I need you to follow me
back to Phoenix.

353
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:03,815
Are you crazy?

354
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,450
I got to get this load
to Dallas.

355
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,651
Well, that's your choice.

356
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:24,234
I got 'em.

357
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:33,914
I think we need
to call your brother.

358
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:35,690
No signal.

359
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:37,322
We must be in the
middle of nowhere.

360
00:20:37,382 --> 00:20:40,151
Lincoln said that
if the Company caught you...

361
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:45,588
I think I saw a side door
back here.

362
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,593
What about the main door?

363
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,862
You'll never get that open.

364
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:50,754
I'm sure it's latched
from the outside.

365
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,253
Can you open the side door?

366
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:54,762
Maybe.

367
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:02,975
Sara.

368
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,040
Help me out.

369
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:12,121
I don't think we're going
to be able to move this.

370
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:19,180
Maybe we won't have to.

371
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,129
<i>I have troubling news</i>
<i>about General Krantz.</i>

372
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,525
He's alive.

373
00:21:23,588 --> 00:21:25,400
I don't see how that's possible.

374
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:28,594
Yes, well, what I'm hearing is a
helicopter with a medic took off

375
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:32,409
from Company headquarters
in Los Angeles one hour ago.

376
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:34,607
It landed for two minutes
in Canyon Country

377
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:36,871
and now it's back
in Los Angeles.

378
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:38,207
So you got the corpse?

379
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:41,377
The helicopter landed
back at Company headquarters.

380
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:43,609
You know how important
getting rid of him is

381
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:45,481
to what we're trying
to accomplish.

382
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,780
All right,
I can still get this done.

383
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:50,161
Not in our time frame.

384
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:56,260
All right, I'm pulling the plug.

385
00:21:56,325 --> 00:21:58,593
We need to start dealing
with the consequences.

386
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,329
Wait, wait, wait.
First things first.

387
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:01,735
He knows that I've betrayed him.

388
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:02,825
I need to disappear.

389
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:05,034
I think that's a good instinct.

390
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,105
I have a house in Sun Valley.

391
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:09,512
I have another idea.

392
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:11,906
Do you mind
putting me on speaker?

393
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:17,140
You know, Griff,
you're a brave man.

394
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,942
And I thank you
for everything you've done.

395
00:22:20,024 --> 00:22:22,921
It's been an honor.

396
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:24,486
Now.

397
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:25,651
"Now" what?

398
00:22:29,757 --> 00:22:32,305
The car in this picture
has Florida plates.

399
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:33,700
Did you ever
vacation there?

400
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:35,401
No.
- Do you know anyone

401
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,659
from Florida who came up to visit?
- No.

402
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:40,829
Why did they take this picture
in front of that car?

403
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:46,140
We didn't.

404
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:47,545
It's been doctored.

405
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:48,745
I'm not sure about that.

406
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:50,875
I mean, the lighting,
the shadows,

407
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,224
all sync up perfectly.

408
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:54,750
This is a '78 Zephyr.

409
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:57,188
Michael was born in '76.

410
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:01,848
You're the only one
who could've picked up on that.

411
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:03,769
She doctored that for you.

412
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:05,527
Let's see what else
she might've changed.

413
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,493
What's the license plate
on that Zephyr?

414
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:09,966
M-L-K 4-4-1.

415
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,998
Martin Luther King Boulevard
intersects with Route 441

416
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:15,511
about five miles north of here.

417
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:16,846
Good.

418
00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:18,840
You guys are here.
Listen, we're a little outmanned

419
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:20,706
down in Little Havana.
We could use some backup.

420
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:22,644
We got a lead
on the buyer.

421
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,378
Great, what are
we waiting for?

422
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,689
I think I'm going to do this myself.
- No, no.

423
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,561
Come on, let's stay together.
- We're a team, right?

424
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,584
I said I got it.
- After our little

425
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:32,117
special deliveries
this morning,

426
00:23:32,188 --> 00:23:33,618
each one of us
has an equal stake.

427
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:36,264
Whoever started this, we're all
going to take them out.

428
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,463
The buyer, we think
it's Lincoln's mother.

429
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:43,893
What?

430
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,700
Like I said, I'm
doing this myself.

431
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:47,900
Linc!

432
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:49,776
If she has Scylla,

433
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,408
she's not just going
to hand it over

434
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:53,238
any more than the
general would have.

435
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,434
You don't know that.

436
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,141
We always thought
whoever had Scylla

437
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:57,511
would do what the general did.

438
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:58,910
Maybe she won't.

439
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,025
Are you serious?

440
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:01,854
Your mother is a Company agent?

441
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:03,290
She was.

442
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:04,653
She might be one
of the good guys now.

443
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,024
With all due respect,

444
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:07,662
I don't think you're in a place
where you can make

445
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:09,290
a clear determination
about that.

446
00:24:09,356 --> 00:24:12,392
Listen, this MLK 441
could be nothing.

447
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,457
But at the church,

448
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:14,659
there could be Scylla.

449
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:17,758
If I need you, I'll call.

450
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:21,840
<i>This should work.</i>

451
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,225
Come on.

452
00:24:39,724 --> 00:24:40,783
Come on.

453
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:48,673
Christina?

454
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:50,297
You need to acknowledge
that our chance

455
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:52,965
of success has substantially
declined in the last 24 hours.

456
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:54,673
There are people
out looking for us.

457
00:24:54,746 --> 00:24:56,881
We need to start thinking
in terms of contingencies.

458
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,674
Just a little while longer;
only a few more days.

459
00:24:59,743 --> 00:25:01,543
General Krantz
refused to adjust

460
00:25:01,617 --> 00:25:03,210
when there were credible
threats against him.

461
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:05,287
That's the reason
we have Scylla now.

462
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:10,251
Are you honestly
comparing me to him?

463
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:16,201
I understand what you think
your role is in all of this,

464
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:17,827
and I appreciate
your efforts.

465
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,260
But if you can't tell
the difference

466
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:21,265
between he and I,
perhaps you need to ask

467
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:23,698
the general
for your old job back.

468
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,681
Oh, look.

469
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:32,034
Here he is.
Would you like to take the call?

470
00:25:36,646 --> 00:25:38,184
Jonathan.

471
00:25:38,252 --> 00:25:39,781
Good afternoon, Christina.

472
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:41,143
It's good to hear your voice.

473
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:43,582
I assume this means
you've retrieved Scylla.

474
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:44,754
Not yet.

475
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:46,689
Oh, troubling news.

476
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,523
Have any idea where it is?

477
00:25:48,603 --> 00:25:50,155
Where are you, Christina?

478
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:53,019
Johannesburg.
Where else would I be?

479
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:54,630
I've had some of my contacts

480
00:25:54,702 --> 00:25:56,401
in your area
check on your house.

481
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,873
There's no one home.

482
00:25:57,939 --> 00:26:00,063
Well, of course not.
As long as Scylla's in play,

483
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:02,144
that address is blown.

484
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:06,608
Where are you, Christina?

485
00:26:06,673 --> 00:26:08,813
I don't like your
tone, Jonathan.

486
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,011
Excuse me

487
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:12,554
if I sound a bit abrasive.

488
00:26:12,627 --> 00:26:15,722
But it's been a while since
anyone's tried to kill me.

489
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:17,589
Oh, my God.

490
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:19,325
Are you all right?
What happened?

491
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:21,324
Oren.

492
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:22,892
"Oren"?

493
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,862
We found his body... executed.

494
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,931
I can only assume that
he's working with someone.

495
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:30,842
Someone who doesn't
tolerate failure.

496
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:33,093
Now, where are you, Christina?

497
00:26:33,178 --> 00:26:35,042
You listen to me.

498
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:37,946
If you're implying that I had
anything to do with this...

499
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:40,142
Where are you?

500
00:26:40,206 --> 00:26:41,985
After everything
I've given the Company:

501
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:44,146
my husband, my children...

502
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,821
I think it's time
that we had a sit-down.

503
00:26:46,884 --> 00:26:49,016
Talk.
Tell you what.

504
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,580
Why don't you gather up
the brain trust:

505
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:55,258
that half-witted daughter
and your psychotic mistress?

506
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,126
Why don't you get together
and figure out where Scylla is?

507
00:26:58,204 --> 00:26:59,338
Then call me.

508
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:30,796
Mr. Burrows.

509
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:40,569
May I escort you
to your table?

510
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:08,310
You haven't changed a bit.

511
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,139
I'm glad you
got my message.

512
00:28:18,223 --> 00:28:20,154
I know it wasn't
the most straightforward

513
00:28:20,217 --> 00:28:22,608
mode of communication,
but I had to be sure it was you.

514
00:28:22,686 --> 00:28:25,584
At least now I know
where Michael gets it from.

515
00:28:30,937 --> 00:28:32,357
I'm sure you have
many questions.

516
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:34,296
Where's Scylla?

517
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:36,239
It's safe.

518
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,131
That's all I can
tell you for right now.

519
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,942
Then we've got
nothing to talk about.

520
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:41,711
Really?

521
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:43,511
That's the only reason
you came here?

522
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,133
Yeah.

523
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,977
I really would've thought
you wanted to know the truth.

524
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:50,114
I know the truth.

525
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:52,447
You work for the Company.

526
00:28:52,516 --> 00:28:54,675
The same people
that set me up for murder.

527
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:55,950
Lincoln...
The same people

528
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:57,980
that have been
trying to kill me and Michael

529
00:28:58,056 --> 00:29:00,386
ever since we
escaped Fox River.

530
00:29:02,188 --> 00:29:04,860
You can think it as much
as you want, I'm not a monster.

531
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:11,833
23 years
and not even an apology?

532
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:15,000
If I thought an apology
would do any good,

533
00:29:15,078 --> 00:29:16,538
I would offer it.

534
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:23,545
Please.

535
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:25,611
Please sit down.

536
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:38,660
Leaving you two boys...

537
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:41,222
was the hardest thing
I ever did.

538
00:29:41,305 --> 00:29:43,271
But you did.

539
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:45,408
And then you went off
and worked for the Company.

540
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,445
You know, you think you know
what the Company is,

541
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:50,506
but you don't.

542
00:29:50,574 --> 00:29:53,214
It is a body
that bends

543
00:29:53,281 --> 00:29:54,776
to the will of its head.

544
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:58,582
And right now, it is
bloodthirsty and war-hungry,

545
00:29:58,651 --> 00:30:01,283
because that's who
General Krantz is.

546
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,219
But what if a woman,

547
00:30:04,297 --> 00:30:07,964
a mother, ran it?

548
00:30:08,024 --> 00:30:10,425
Can you imagine the different
that would make?

549
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:11,855
You think you're a mother?

550
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:13,753
A mother's priority

551
00:30:13,831 --> 00:30:15,797
is her family.

552
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:18,144
If I give Scylla to the general,
he leaves me

553
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:20,003
and Michael alone,
and I get to spend time

554
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,569
with my son in peace.

555
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:25,737
Look, I could sit here for days
and try to explain to you

556
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:27,884
why I did what I did.

557
00:30:27,944 --> 00:30:30,074
Suffice it to say,
I couldn't protect you then,

558
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:33,076
but let me protect you now.

559
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,921
What if General Krantz
were no longer in the picture?

560
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,322
Once he is
dealt with,

561
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:43,755
no one would
come after you.

562
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:45,628
But I need time, Lincoln.

563
00:30:45,703 --> 00:30:46,989
I need two days

564
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:48,565
to put everything
into place.

565
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:50,473
If you give me
two days...

566
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:54,266
...then I can give you
and Michael

567
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:56,172
your complete
and utter freedom.

568
00:31:05,857 --> 00:31:07,184
All right.

569
00:31:09,698 --> 00:31:10,854
All right.

570
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:12,360
I'm going to get started
right away.

571
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:14,432
But if Krantz
suspects any of this,

572
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,524
he's going to hunt us both down.

573
00:31:17,595 --> 00:31:20,428
And for that reason,

574
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,972
I can't risk
being seen with you

575
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:24,794
until all of this is over.

576
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,836
How will I get
in touch with you?

577
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:30,607
You can't.

578
00:31:30,676 --> 00:31:32,281
I'm sorry.

579
00:31:58,037 --> 00:31:59,769
<i>Once we pull this box down,</i>

580
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:00,967
<i>it'll push</i>
<i>the water machine</i>

581
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,482
right through the side door.

582
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:04,210
We're slowing down.
I think we're getting off the highway.

583
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:05,954
I'm almost ready.
Hold on.

584
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,320
Sara, grab that
strap over there.

585
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:19,826
All right, hold it.

586
00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:21,938
Sara, get behind me.

587
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:30,436
Come on!

588
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:42,554
Ready?

589
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:44,448
Jump!

590
00:32:48,655 --> 00:32:50,098
You all right?

591
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:10,192
<i>After you clear the area</i>

592
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:11,553
I don't anticipate
any problems.

593
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,528
All right?

594
00:33:13,597 --> 00:33:14,666
Scylla or not here we come.

595
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:15,704
All right.
- Hold on.

596
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:18,561
Hold on.

597
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:22,371
What the hell are
those guys doing?

598
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,842
We're not going against any
additional people in there.

599
00:33:26,914 --> 00:33:27,920
We wait until they come

600
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:29,345
back out.

601
00:33:33,418 --> 00:33:35,751
So Lincoln's mother is
really the buyer?

602
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:38,790
It appears that way.

603
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:40,065
I hope he
understands,

604
00:33:40,123 --> 00:33:43,065
that if I need to take her
out to get to Scylla,

605
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:45,060
I'm not going to hesitate
to kill her.

606
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:46,527
No question.

607
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:48,490
Well, let's just hope
it doesn't come to that.

608
00:33:48,564 --> 00:33:50,732
You serious?

609
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:52,598
Yeah. Am I serious
if we can get Scylla

610
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:53,775
without killing Linc's mother,

611
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:55,570
that's the preferable outcome.

612
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:56,871
Wait a second.

613
00:33:56,941 --> 00:33:58,669
If I'm gonna be in the
foxhole with you,

614
00:33:58,741 --> 00:34:00,783
I need to know that
you have my back.

615
00:34:04,954 --> 00:34:07,760
Mrs. Burrows
has the item,

616
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,176
and the only way to get it
is to kill her.

617
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:11,254
What is your move?

618
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,893
I pull the trigger.

619
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:23,298
There they go,

620
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:25,668
come on.

621
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,979
Don Self,

622
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:38,289
Homeland

623
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:39,442
Security.

624
00:34:39,517 --> 00:34:41,055
We're investigating

625
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,824
a cruelty to animal charge.

626
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:46,661
I have no idea what
you're referring to.

627
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,715
We're referring
to ritual

628
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:48,996
slaughters of chickens.

629
00:34:49,062 --> 00:34:50,653
Okay, that might be allowed
where you come from

630
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,401
but here in America,
that's <i>no mas.</i>

631
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,060
Chickens?

632
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:56,070
This is preposterous.

633
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:57,661
This is because
I'm Caribbean.

634
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,666
I swear to God, I smelled

635
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,768
chicken blood.
Worse than the place

636
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,104
down the street we shut down.
- Hey.

637
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:03,638
You want to turn this
into something?

638
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:06,266
Sit down.

639
00:35:06,346 --> 00:35:08,269
If there aren't
any chickens,

640
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:09,320
there aren't any chickens.

641
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:10,412
But we're not going to know that

642
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:11,623
until we take
a look around.

643
00:35:11,673 --> 00:35:13,425
The smell was coming
from back there.

644
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,329
That is our sanctuary.

645
00:35:16,384 --> 00:35:18,581
I cannot let you
to disrupt it.

646
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,665
I understand your concerns,
but I need to go back there.

647
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,433
I insist,
you cannot do that.

648
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,494
Best I can do is have you
accompany us, please.

649
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,562
Please.

650
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:29,594
You,

651
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:30,946
come on, let's
go outside

652
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:31,935
until they're done.

653
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:33,004
Let's go.

654
00:35:44,582 --> 00:35:46,750
That's not a very heavenly thing
to do.

655
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:16,043
Find anything?

656
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:17,453
Oh, yeah.

657
00:36:18,783 --> 00:36:20,794
Wow.

658
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:26,195
What the hell are they up to?

659
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:27,898
I don't know.

660
00:36:27,957 --> 00:36:29,993
He just asked to rent
that closet.

661
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,694
Did a woman ever come
down here with him?

662
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,538
Yeah, once.

663
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,857
I'm telling you,

664
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:36,201
that's all I know.

665
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:40,236
Drop it.

666
00:36:43,942 --> 00:36:45,946
Don't.

667
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:49,412
Come here.

668
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:51,948
Both of you,

669
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,451
on your knees.

670
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:56,962
I said on your knees.

671
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:03,087
I told you not to come in here.

672
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:12,976
Where's the
other guy?

673
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,470
He ran. Let's go.

674
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:16,241
Let's go.

675
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:24,658
Are you all right?

676
00:37:24,713 --> 00:37:25,907
Yeah.

677
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,090
Let's go.

678
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:02,682
Come on.

679
00:38:36,996 --> 00:38:39,635
We're not going to make
it back to the truck.

680
00:38:39,698 --> 00:38:41,073
I know.

681
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:43,106
Here.

682
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,073
Take this.

683
00:38:44,142 --> 00:38:45,306
I'll be right back.

684
00:38:45,376 --> 00:38:46,353
Michael.

685
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:48,278
Michael!

686
00:39:36,593 --> 00:39:38,368
You all right?

687
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:39,557
Yeah, thanks.

688
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,228
The General should know by now
not to mess with us.

689
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,162
The General...

690
00:40:13,231 --> 00:40:15,761
didn't send me.

691
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:20,746
Who did?

692
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:22,806
Who sent you?

693
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,966
Lincoln!

694
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,436
We've got news.

695
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:52,603
So do I.

696
00:40:52,671 --> 00:40:54,134
We're staying low for two days.

697
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:56,645
Christina's promised
to get rid of Krantz.

698
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:57,909
I think she's lying.

699
00:40:57,976 --> 00:40:59,913
I know it sounds crazy,

700
00:40:59,986 --> 00:41:01,743
she said she's going
to change the Company

701
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:02,942
in the way it operates.

702
00:41:03,014 --> 00:41:05,450
So what, the Company's gonna go
nonviolent now?

703
00:41:05,517 --> 00:41:07,753
Just hear me out.
I'm telling you. I think she's lying.

704
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:09,321
It's from the church.
Some kind of credential.

705
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:11,388
There were some automatic
weapons in there, too.

706
00:41:11,453 --> 00:41:13,954
And trust me, if there's
fake IDs and weapons

707
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:15,322
something big's
about to go down.

708
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:16,793
Your mom,

709
00:41:16,855 --> 00:41:18,130
she said after two days,

710
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:19,500
that's when she would
make the change.

711
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:20,602
Yeah.

712
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:22,098
Take a look at the date
on that laminate,

713
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:23,863
two days away.

714
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,502
You think that's just a coincidence?
- Come on,

715
00:41:25,577 --> 00:41:26,745
Lincoln, you can't be surprised

716
00:41:26,806 --> 00:41:28,405
that a woman that would abandon
her kids

717
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:29,771
would be less
than truthful

718
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:31,471
about her intentions
right now.

719
00:41:31,547 --> 00:41:33,444
Hey, were you going?
- I need to talk to her.

720
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:35,152
Just take a moment.
Let's figure this out.

721
00:41:35,218 --> 00:41:36,775
If she's looking to
head the Company,

722
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:39,851
there has to a more realistic
plan than a one-man

723
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:40,930
frontal assault.

724
00:41:40,984 --> 00:41:41,963
She'll listen to me.

725
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,454
She asked you not to come back,
Linc.

726
00:41:43,527 --> 00:41:44,531
That's a warning.

727
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:23,699
Lincoln's back at the plaza.

728
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:26,674
I think we need

729
00:42:26,726 --> 00:42:28,099
to realize
he's more of a threat

730
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:29,367
than we gave him
credit for.

731
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:30,778
He found the mansion.

732
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,506
His guys got the stash
at the church.

733
00:42:32,578 --> 00:42:33,734
He's not going to stop.

734
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:36,808
I told him to stay away.

735
00:42:44,784 --> 00:42:46,884
Sir,

736
00:42:46,948 --> 00:42:48,995
Alpha is a go.

737
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:50,222
Christina,

738
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:52,290
we have a clean shot.

739
00:43:03,566 --> 00:43:05,537
Take it.

740
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:06,638
Take it.

741
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:07,639
