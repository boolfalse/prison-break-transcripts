the charcoal lavage in time.

159
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,696
You and your baby are gonna be okay.

160
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:28,006
You know the strychnine didn't get
into my meatloaf all by itself, right?

161
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:32,847
Well, then,
you need to talk to the warden about it.

162
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,047
Then how about talking to me
about your face?

163
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,908
Do you want to tell me
how that happened?

164
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,296
I caught an elbow playing basketball.

165
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,564
We should discuss your situation.

166
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,160
As I'm sure you've ascertained

167
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,763
this isn't going to be
a run-of-the-mill pregnancy.

168
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,632
- Do I deliver in here?
- No.

169
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,835
The day we induce,
we'll secure you in an ambulance,

170
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,138
take you to Saint Lucia down the road,
we'll cordon off a room.

171
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,074
There'll be three armed guards
in there with me when you give birth.

172
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,575
Do I get to see my baby?

173
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:10,021
You'll have 30 minutes
before we take it away.

174
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,119
I've seen this process a dozen times.

175
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,188
After the mothers come back here,
the depression is almost unbearable.

176
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:24,189
My advice, it's a lot less messy
if you just think of yourself as a surrogate.

177
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,969
(CELL PHONE RlNGlNG)

178
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,441
Yeah.

179
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,410
Michael, it's Blue Phillips.

180
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:42,013
Listen, your wife had an incident
earlier today.

181
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,115
Someone tried to poison her.

182
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,483
What are you talking about?

183
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,085
Michael, I need you to focus.

184
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,554
Do you have any idea
who might've done this?

185
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,055
Michael? Michael.

186
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,426
All right. Let him in.

187
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,408
If I had a list of all the people
who might come to visit me,

188
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,578
your name would be at the bottom,
somewhere below

189
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,547
Jesus Christ and Scooby Doo.

190
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:18,350
Someone tried to poison Sara today.

191
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,484
Mercy!

192
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,354
Only you would be depraved enough

193
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:25,256
to think that killing an innocent woman
and her unborn child

194
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,960
would bring you some kind of peace
before your execution.

195
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,461
Sara is with child?

196
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,898
Congratulations.

197
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,068
This is like the 4th of July
and Christmas day rolled into one.

198
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:41,989
I'm asking you, father to father,
to leave her alone.

199
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:47,379
You can kill me if you want to kill me.
I'll trade my life for hers.

200
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,980
But leave Sara alone.

201
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:55,352
Michael, if you were killed,
your pain would last a moment.

202
00:15:55,988 --> 00:16:00,792
If Sara were killed,
your pain would last the rest of your life.

203
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:05,463
Now, that's got to be appealing
to whoever put out this hit.

204
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,632
But don't worry, Michael,

205
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,573
if I find out anything
I'll be sure to let you know.

206
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,173
WARDEN: Prison life can be tough.

207
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,274
If I remember correctly

208
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,543
you have two missing toes
that can attest to that fact.

209
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:22,747
I don't think you understand.
She's not safe here!

210
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:27,452
Please. Please just approve the transfer
to another facility.

211
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,688
If I grant her a transfer,
everybody is gonna want one.

212
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,489
What about segregated housing?

213
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,193
Is there something that I should know
about the structural integrity of SHU?

214
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,629
Great. I can see where this is going.

215
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,097
I know who you are

216
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,133
and I'm not gonna let you
turn my prison into the next Fox River.

217
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,403
All I'm trying to do is keep my wife alive.

218
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:49,634
- You do know she's pregnant.
- I don't care.

219
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,258
- Here.
- Thanks.

220
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,993
In case I haven't made myself clear,

221
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:13,064
Sara Tancredi is not getting
any preferential treatment.

222
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:19,235
Well, you've made yourself
perfectly clear. Thank you for your time.

223
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,843
- LlNCOLN: What happened?
- The General wants Sara dead

224
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,444
and the warden's just gonna let it happen.

225
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,080
Look, we got a lawyer on the case,
and he's gonna get her out, all right?

226
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,315
There's not enough time.

227
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,551
If she stays in that prison,
someone's gonna kill her.

228
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,482
I guess we don't have a choice.

229
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,324
We're breaking her out.

230
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,269
LANG: In my 16 years in the Bureau,

231
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,320
I've worked cases under
43 different agents.

232
00:17:55,775 --> 00:18:00,974
Alexander Mahone is
the smartest, bravest,

233
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:05,350
most honorable man
I've ever had the pleasure of serving with.

234
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:10,955
Well, as one of those 43 agents,
I can't help but feel a bit offended,

235
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:16,227
because, obviously, I'm not as honored
as this drug-addicted murderer.

236
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,297
Alex has been clean and sober
for four months.

237
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,166
And he's been completely exonerated

238
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,868
of all crimes associated
with his involvement with the Company.

239
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,305
That doesn't include the shooting
and murder of one Oscar Shales

240
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,774
and burying his body under the birdbath.

241
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,976
That is just an allegation.

242
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,111
Let's move on, shall we?

243
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,947
All those in favor of
reinstating Alexander Mahone

244
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:40,018
as Special Agent
in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

245
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,519
Aye.

246
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:48,056
- All those opposed.
- All right. All right.

247
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,061
(EXHALES)

248
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,835
Thank you for the invite, Richard.

249
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,003
It's always a pleasure.

250
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,742
You know, Alex,
this ruling can be revisited

251
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,811
if you are able to sufficiently demonstrate

252
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,348
just how committed you are
to a life of service.

253
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,118
Now, as you may know,
Sara Tancredi was arrested recently

254
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,722
and is currently being housed
at the Miami-Dade State Penitentiary.

255
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:21,559
We have concerns that Michael Scofield
may have other plans for her.

256
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,927
(LAUGHS)

257
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:27,158
So this...
This is why you invite me in here?

258
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,933
SULLlNS: Well, obviously, if Scofield

259
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:32,604
were to be able to pull off
this plot of another breakout,

260
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:36,040
the public embarrassment
would be immense to the Bureau.

261
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,377
So, having someone to get us
credible information,

262
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,446
that would be worth something to us.

263
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,749
Agent Wheatley is set up in Miami.
He would be your contact.

264
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,250
You're something else.

265
00:19:55,527 --> 00:20:00,692
Now, we both know
how badly you want that badge back.

266
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,601
Give me a reason to give it to you.

267
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,873
What's your plan after we break her out?
We on the run again?

268
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,875
First things first. Let's get her out of there.

269
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:17,096
Hey, papi, the Fed that arrested Sara,
he's outside, staking us out.

270
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,951
Look, if you're worried about
getting into trouble again,

271
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,755
go back to Chicago, go back to your family.
I'll understand.

272
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:24,956
Are you kidding me?

273
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,090
After all the crap we've been through,

274
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,259
I'm just gonna leave you here
and Sara in there?

275
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,595
You shut up and don't bring it up again.

276
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,796
What's all that?

277
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:36,167
Newspaper clippings covering
seven different escape attempts

278
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,636
from Miami-Dade State Pen
over the last 60 years.

279
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:42,040
None of them... None of them successful.

280
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,842
So, we read them all
and we learn what not to do.

281
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:48,579
Well, the prison officials learned a lot.
They reevaluated, they retrofitted.

282
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,215
Prison's practically escape-proof.

283
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,886
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

284
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,322
Okay, so if we can't go through,
what if we go down?

285
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,458
Like down into the prison,
like we parachute in.

286
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,794
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you parachute in, you find her,

287
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:03,895
- and we get her out.
- Are you kidding?

288
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,196
- I'm serious.
- That's suicide.

289
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:09,367
Hey! Hey, hey. Newspaper clippings
are only gonna get us so far.

290
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,235
We need some more information
about the prison.

291
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,876
So let's do some recon work.

292
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,241
"Camera, electronic tape measure,
dry ice." What's this?

293
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,742
It's a shopping list.

294
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,817
You need to come with me, doll.

295
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,286
I have a doctor's appointment
for my pregnancy in 15 minutes.

296
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,787
It'll wait.

297
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,590
In here.

298
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,693
Hold it.

299
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,407
I don't know what you want,
but I promise you, I will go down fighting.

300
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,658
Damn, baby, I ain't gonna hurt you.

301
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:56,262
Hell, I ain't even gonna touch you.

302
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,854
See, I run the motor pool detail in here,

303
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:05,890
and I was thinking,
if you want to get yourself a little fresh air

304
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,793
and not have to worry about
getting stuck in the back,

305
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:12,204
then you could come and work with me.

306
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,220
You're the Fed from my wedding.

307
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,390
- Yeah, you can call me Agent Wheatley.
- I could call you a lot of things.

308
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,758
- Where you headed?
- SeaWorld.

309
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,527
- SeaWorld? There isn't one in Miami.
- My loss.

310

who put her in prison in the first place.

No, I didn't put her in prison.

My testimony will be
that your brother let me in,

Those pictures were taken
from public property,

and that prison was paid for
by the tax payers.

452
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,661
So all you have evidence of
is an exonerated citizen

standing on a public road
taking pictures of a public building.

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,097
Airtight.

467
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,500
Well, thank goodness for that.

468
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,136
But you guys will let me know
if anything comes up, right?

469
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,777
You'll be the first to know.

470
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:46,342
I won't keep you.

471
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:02,159
On the outside, I was known
for getting the job done no matter what.

472
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,994
I got paid well for it.

473
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,829
Now I'm broke.

474
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,066
- But I still need things.
- Like what?

475
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:12,536
- A favor?
- I don't do favors for cons.

476
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:16,039
Really? It's not what it says
on the bathroom wall.

477
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:21,230
As I understand, you do favors
for those who reciprocate.

478
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,349
Is that true?

479
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,217
Hey, this is bush league, boss.

480
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:39,395
I'm a Fed around here.

481
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,392
Ain't no reason to toss me.

482
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,733
You... Hey... You know me.

483
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,775
Looky, looky here.

484
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,478
No, that brown ain't mine, boss.
You know this.

485
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,346
I don't do no drugs.

486
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,847
Who put that in there?

487
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:03,553
You... Get your hands off me.
I know where the hole is.

488
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,889
What you looking at?

489
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,390
I don't do no drugs.

490
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,095
Somebody is going down for this.

491
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,596
I love you, too.

492
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,367
Sofia is making arrangements
in Central America.

493
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,469
Once you break Sara out,
we're on a boat and we're gone.

(CELL PHONE RlNGlNG)

495
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,507
- Hey.
- It's Blue.

496
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:25,075
Just got the decision from the court.

497
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,178
They are ordering the warden
to allow supervised visitation.

00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,614
(SlGHS)

499
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,516
- Where you going?
- They're letting me see Sara.

500
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:34,918
Wait up, wait up, wait up.

501
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,420
They're going to be listening
to every word you say.

502
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,988
You gotta be careful about this.

503
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,525
If she understood my letter,
she'll find a way to tell me.

504
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:44,436
How? She gonna blink Morse code?

505
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,754
Oh, my God.

506
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,761
Oh, my God.

507
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:21,398
- Who did this to you?
- I'm okay. Baby's okay.

508
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,899
Sara, I'm so sorry.

509
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,922
You're in here because of me.

510
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,508
I'm sorry. It's just hard.

511
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:37,305
- I miss you so much.
- No touching.

512
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,984
I miss you, too.

513
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,397
You just have to hang in there, okay?

514
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:50,368
I'm trying, but my protection's gone.

515
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,793
- Did you get my letter?
- I did.

516
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,337
I know sometimes it's hard for me
to express what I wanna say,

517
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:05,098
but I hope you understood
what I meant to tell you.

518
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,709
I did.

519
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,680
Is he getting cute?

520
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,950
You were there for me.

521
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,451
I will be there for you.

522
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,388
Okay.

523
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,889
All right, that's it.

524
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,525
Time's up.

525
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:26,562
See you soon.

526
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,770
Bye.

527
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:51,721
WOMAN OVER PA: Attention all inmates
and visitors. Visiting hours are now over.

528
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,423
Please proceed immediately to the exit.

529
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,924
Michael.

530
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,565
I was thinking a lot
about the photos and the mockup

531
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,935
that you showed me at the loft,
and I ran a few tests.

532
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,938
Lo and behold, I found a blind spot

533
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:11,475
right along the fence line over here
due to a retrofit.

534
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:15,645
You didn't know about this, did you?
No. No, of course not.

535
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:19,216
Because you would've told me
or the warden about it if you did. Right?

536
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,451
It's a good thing I found this when I did

537
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,152
before anyone tried to escape.

538
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,670
Well, if we can't go through the fence,
then that leaves under or over.

539
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,840
Look, how's she gonna climb that fence
without being seen? Huh?

540
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:46,877
I'm guessing there's no telephone wire
for her to climb across.

541
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,645
Then she's gotta go under.

542
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,514
All right. Let's get some shovels.

543
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,616
What was that you were saying
about parachutes?

544
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,084
MAHONE: Parachutes?

545
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:57,487
Guys, come on. You can't be...
Parachutes?

546
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,588
MAHONE: A couple of thoughts on that.

547
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,625
A, we don't have a plane.
B, we don't have a pilot.

548
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,893
Have you ever worn a parachute?

549
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:06,329
Don't worry. I think I've got a plan.

550
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,232
But we're gonna need some help
from an old friend.

551
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,567
Who?

552
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,068
You want a favor from me.

553
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,371
Just hear me out.

554
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:18,341
Of course, I mean, when you and Michael
sent me back to that prison,

555
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,810
you did give me a piece of chewing gum.

556
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,713
I mean, what kind of man would I be
if I didn't quid your pro quo.

557
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:30,714
Look, all you gotta do is set off the
fire alarm in here tomorrow night at 7:30.

558
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,289
That's it.

559
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,157
You're breaking her out?

560
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,426
Krantz has put a hit on her.

561
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:40,329
It's our one shot of keeping her alive.

562
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,900
Well, you're in a pickle covered in jam,
Lincoln.

563
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,637
We'll put five grand in your kick
once this whole thing jumps off.

564
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:51,141
The love of Michael's life.
That's only worth $5,000?

565
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:53,410
It's the best we can do.

566
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:56,012
- I need six figures.
- It's all we've got.

567
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,649
Well, lucky day for you,
I know somebody who does.

568
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,150
The General's man.

569
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,420
He's got the payout for Sara's hit.

570
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:10,126
You wire that money to me
by 7:00 p.m. tomorrow,

571
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,862
- and we're in business.
- What's his name?

572
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,998
Get your brother to use that noggin of his.

573
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,233
Come on, you gotta give me
more than that.

574
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:19,324
Tomorrow, 7:00 p.m. Go on, fetch.

575
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:40,824
You're a tough girl to get alone.
I know he's breaking you out.

576
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:43,325
I'm coming with you.

577
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,133
Relax.

578
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,535
Krantz sent me to kill you,
but after what he's put me through,

579
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,004
I'm done taking orders from him.

580
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:56,306
You were sitting next to me in the mess
when I was poisoned.

581
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:59,242
You think you would've lasted this long
if I wanted you dead?

582
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,144
I want you dead. You're still alive.

583
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,947
You think it's hard to stay alive
when you know who's coming after you?

584
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:10,268
There's 200 women in this prison.
Could you even get out of Gen Pop?

585
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:17,820
I'm coming with you or nobody's going.

586
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,572
(SNlFFlNG)

587
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,691
You should've seen the look
on Michael's face

588
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:52,228
when he saw me fixing that fence
and installing that camera.

589
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,729
You did a great job.

590
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,465
Well, job's over now.

591
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:03,206
If Michael has this misguided belief
that Sara's life is in danger,

592
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,408
he's gonna find a way back
into that prison.

593
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,211
Your job won't be over
until you give us enough evidence

594
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,802
to put him back behind bars.

595
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,383
So, what's the latest?

596
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:17,420
There's nothing concrete,
but I'll let you know when I get something.

597
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,122
All right.

598
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,623
Good man.

599
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,983
(SlGHS)

600
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:53,624
Well, if you're watching this, I'm glad,
because that means you're safe.

601
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:03,466
How does he think he's gonna do this, bro?

602
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:04,667
He's gonna jump out of a plane.

603
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:07,203
I know he's gonna jump,
but the question is, can he land?

604
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,438
Not without getting caught.

605
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,039
And how's he gonna get her out
of the cell block?

606
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,442
- Even if T-Bag...
- It's a big "if."

607
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,113
Trusting T-Bag is just crazy.

608
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:19,149
Michael, we really have to rethink this.

609
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:22,240
I have, and there's no other way.

610
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:26,589
Okay, I'm gonna drop down
into this outer area here,

611
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,159
and I'll cut the parachute off
before anyone can reach me.

612
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,627
They're gonna be right on your ass.

613
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:33,129
I can hide behind this building,
wait for a window.

614
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,031
And I'll make my way over here.

615
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:39,102
That's the chapel,
where hopefully Sara will be waiting.

616
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,170
LlNCOLN: Why the chapel?

617
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,371
During a riot in '88,

618
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:43,907
prison employees escaped
through the administration building

619
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,876
and wound up here, outside the fence.

620
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:50,346
The administration building
is connected to the chapel,

621
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,982
which means that
somewhere in that compound

622
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,118
there's a subterranean exit.

623
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,655
If we can get through it,
you can meet us there.

How's Sara gonna get to the chapel?

She'll have to find a way.

00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,603
I need you to find a plane and a pilot.

630
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,405
And I need you two to take care of T-Bag.

631

Find out exactly who has this money
and where they're keeping it.

632
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,610
And then we have to get it.

633
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,111
By 7:00 p.m. tonight,

634
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,869
or Sara's gonna die in there.

635
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:29,352
Is everybody onboard?

your assignment.

Well, I've got the cash, but
there may be some delay in final delivery.

getting near Sara Tancredi.

- It's cool.
- Thanks.

651

Not too smart, though,
for a girl with a bounty on her head.

I've been trying to find a way to do this,

00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,779
but from where we stand right now
there's only one option.

Do you need more time to think?

No. No, it's not that.
I've made up my mind.

There's really nothing you can do about it,

665
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,489
except pray for us tonight.

Pray for us?

00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:59,135
You can pray for us to be together.

Maybe I'll do the same.

The log book outside says that Krantz
had one visitor yesterday. Joe Daniels.

671
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:18,087
Well, using the power of deduction,
I'd say Daniels is your bagman.

live in Miami? Thousands. I need more.

Yeah. Several.
Some for sport, some necessity.

- What do you got?
- It's a test.

690
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,216
See, the prison was built in the mid '80s,

691
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,918
so that exit in the administration building

692
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:25,321
is probably protected
by an electronic coded lock

693

modified by a security card.

694
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:31,928
Those locks don't have power protection,
which means you can override them.

695
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:34,263
And you can't just go to the building's
generator and blow it out?

696
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:40,203
No, a 1,200 volt power surge
will just set off the other alarms.

01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:45,333
I want every inch of that fence line
checked for points of compromise.

01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:47,834
Yes, sir.

this is where they're gonna come out.

You think Sucre made the drop on time?

What for?

Something's going on in bitch block.
I don't know.

947

What's it worth to you to find out?

We gotta get through here?

949
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:05,513
On the other side is a kind of
escape hatch for the administrators

in case of a riot.

951

If this is the same system they have
in Fox River,

952

that door can only be opened remotely
from the central control room.

953

That's why we had to ask for help.

Tell them what you told me.

956
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:26,701
Michael Scofield's about
to stage a prison break.

957
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:30,822
And I know exactly
how he's going to do it.

958
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:34,509
Exactly what did Scofield ask you to do?

959
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:40,515
Just light a fire in my cell,
and the rest will just take care of itself.

960
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,284
Fire alarm. When that goes off,
what's your protocol?

961
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,153
State law, mandatory evac.

962
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,989
Yeah, he wasn't gonna break her out,
he was gonna get you to escort her out.

963
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:50,710
Shut up. Get him out of here.

964
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:54,662
All right. Evacuation's only
going to get him out in the yard.

965
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:58,833
Whatever he's up to,
he needs noise and he needs chaos.

966
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:01,169
Deactivate the smoke detector system,
the fire alarm,

967
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,438
and while you're at it, kill the horn.

968
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,975
If anybody so much as bends
a blade of grass in this place,

969
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:09,746

01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:57,323
He's a rat.

977
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:00,795
Anything?

978
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:02,530
So far, just a female inmate
loose in the yard.

979
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:05,099
- Tancredi?
- No, Morgan, first name, Gretchen.

980
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,250
- Over by the chapel.
- All right.

981
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:18,211
SCOFlELD: All right.

982
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:23,283
Great. Let's go.

983
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:32,358
Okay, down there.

984
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,543
Okay.

985
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,982
Beyond this door should be
a hundred yards of tunnel.

986
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,350
On the other end of that is Linc,

987
01:15:55,351 --> 01:16:01,461
and after that there's a boat
bound for white sand and blue water.

988
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:06,728
I'll power-surge this system. It will
override the reader for just a few seconds,

989
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:12,019
just long enough for you
to open the hatch, so get ready.

Three, two, one.

we're gonna find another way out of here.

996

I know what I have to do.

997
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,716

- I don't know.

1000
01:17:12,428 --> 01:17:15,548
They should have been here by now.

1001
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:21,135
The battery wasn't
generating enough power.

1002
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:25,766
We have to blow the system
for the whole building.

1003
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,810
Okay, what do you want to try?

1004
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:37,719
This is the main fuse. If I yank that,
everything will go dark for a second.

1005
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,790
If I reconnect these two cables...

1006
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:45,960
If I reconnect these two cables,
there'll be a lot of noise.

1007
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:47,562
Every light bulb
in this place is gonna blow.

1008
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:50,465
As soon as that happens,
you need to open that hatch.

1009

I wouldn't have had much time anyway.

And I want you to promise me
that you're going to tell my child...

1088
01:27:49,731 --> 01:27:54,401
That you're going to tell my child
how much they're loved every day.

1089
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:58,771
And remind them
how lucky they are to be free.

1090
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:03,042
Because we are.

1091
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:06,145
We're free now.

1092
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:08,914
Finally.

1093
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:13,118
We're free.
