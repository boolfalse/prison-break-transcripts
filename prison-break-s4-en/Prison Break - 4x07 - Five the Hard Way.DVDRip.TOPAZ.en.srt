1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,649
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:03,818 --> 00:00:07,652
These are GPS ankle monitors.
Now, step up, take one and put it on.

3
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:11,280
When the exchange is over, you and I
are gonna spend some quality time.

4
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:12,824
These aren't release papers.

5
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:16,828
I did the best I could. You need to
sign those so I can collect Roland's device.

6
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:19,796
You want me to give up the one thing
that makes me valuable?

7
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:21,798
You knew the deal
when you came onboard.

8
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:24,233
Wanna flush it down
because you made a bad move?

9
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:27,863
This man just came
into a $ 100,000 inheritance.

10
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:31,034
- I don't recognize him.
- Lf you see him, please give us a call.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,743
- You don't work for the IRS?
- I don't.

12
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,817
- Who do you work for?
- As of now, myself.

13
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:40,010
I'm an associate of General Krantz.

14
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:42,315
The general, he likes his privacy.

15
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:51,658
I knew you were rotten from the beginning.
I want you to walk me through this...

16
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:54,699
...and if you can't,
well, I'm gonna call the authorities.

17
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:56,598
Cole Pfeiffer.

18
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:01,502
Who the hell are you?

19
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:24,125
The last time
a pretty little filly like yourself...

20
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:27,597
...knocked me senseless
and tied me to a chair...

21
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:29,201
...I had to pay for it.

22
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,465
You still might.

23
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:36,237
That book was a gift
from a very dear friend of mine...

24
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,970
...who left this realm all too soon.

25
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:43,742
The only thing that James Whistler
ever gave anybody was the clap.

26
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:51,952
You have 30 seconds to tell me something
that I don't already know.

27
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:56,091
I followed that book from Panama City...

28
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:59,961
...where James Whistler and I
were co-incarcerated...

29
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:02,602
...to a bus locker in San Diego.

30
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,933
Inside was information
pertaining to this apartment.

31
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:08,299
Scylla.

32
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:10,603
How about that? Does that ring a bell?

33
00:02:10,778 --> 00:02:12,905
What do you know about Scylla?

34
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:16,073
I'm the one holding the keys.

35
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,150
Because without me...

36
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,346
...that bird book's about as meaningful
as a fart in a windstorm.

37
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:24,684
I've commandeered Whistler's alias.

38
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:26,986
I infiltrated his place of business...

39
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:30,187
...because it's the gateway
to the whole damn thing.

40
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:32,459
Where's the location?

41
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:36,937
What are you bringing to the jamboree,
darling, huh?

42
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:40,972
Aside from those baby blues and a knife?

43
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:46,707
This is me.

44
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:50,013
This is Scylla.

45
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:54,047
And this is you.

46
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:58,453
I'm gonna get Scylla.

47
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:02,061
And it can either be with you...

48
00:03:04,332 --> 00:03:05,458
...or through you.

49
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:12,368
So why don't you give me
that informed decision right now...

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,832
...before I spill your hillbilly guts
all over the carpet.

51
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:20,075
Because you're messing
with the wrong bitch.

52
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,177
How may I be of service?

53
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:32,749
- Unbelievable.
- We were planning our move on Scuderi...

54
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:34,394
...when he chartered the flight.

55
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:37,998
No chance you dragged your feet
waiting for Scuderi to charter the flight?

56
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:39,496
Yeah, we wanna drag this out.

57
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,431
The location's pretty convenient,
wouldn't you say, Linc?

58
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:45,231
Scuderi splitting town
kind of caught us a break, huh?

59
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:46,873
Would you shut him up?

60
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:53,139
We could wait till he comes back. AgriSow
makes farm chemicals. It's not Fort Knox.

61
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,078
You wanna bet?
Their patents are worth billions.

62
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,913
Which is why companies tend
to keep a very close eye on those patents.

63
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:02,112
We could breach through security,
in a week.

64
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:04,450
We could get in the guy's house,
week, minimum.

65
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:08,425
We could follow the guy for 12 hours
and have card five by midnight. How's that?

66
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:12,387
How does this sound? If you're not back
by midnight, you're going to jail.

67
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:16,229
- Yeah, don't I know it.
- Let's talk outside.

68
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:21,705
So, what's the plan?

69
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,204
We're going to Vegas.

70
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,542
Oh, hell, yes. Yo, I call shotgun, huh?
Who's got? Hey. Yeah?

71
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:39,723
What do you wanna talk about,
Agent Self?

72
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:42,795
I've been part of hundreds of operations
during my career...

73
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:46,091
...and I've never been
on the top of someone's hit list.

74
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:50,033
- What are you talking about?
- Lf this hit man, Wyatt, can find me once...

75
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:54,834
...it's only a matter of time until he creeps
up in the back of my rear-view mirror again.

76
00:04:55,242 --> 00:04:58,803
That's not true. You'll never see him
coming at all if he's coming after you.

77
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,641
- That's comforting.
- You think I want that? You're dead...

78
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:03,875
...we're all back in jail.

79
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:07,678
You were an agent longer than me.
What's my play here?

80
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:09,755
Okay, let me get this straight...

81
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:12,688
...you turn your back on me
and now you wanna know my play?

82
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,886
That was your fault.
What would you have done?

83
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,238
I've tracked down rapists, killers,
even former military...

84
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:30,400
...but a structural engineer from Illinois
was able to get to me.

85
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:33,012
- You wanna know how?
- Yeah, I wanna know.

86
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,772
He stopped running.

87
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:39,345
He got aggressive.
He took the game to me.

88
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,714
That's your play.

89
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:43,952
That's your only play.

90
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:56,368
I shouldn't have to remind you
that killing a federal agent...

91
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:59,870
...is a complicated matter,
even in our line of work.

92
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:04,676
Perhaps Mahone
is just the tip of the iceberg.

93
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:09,145
We've been searching for the link between
supermax and Burrows and Scofield.

94
00:06:09,316 --> 00:06:10,476
I believe we've found it.

95
00:06:10,651 --> 00:06:13,313
If Scofield and Burrows
are working with the government...

96
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:17,048
...we've got a much bigger problem than
one bureaucrat at Homeland Security.

97
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:20,923
But it begins with that bureaucrat.

98
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:25,031
And if Don Self
is the head of the snake...

99
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:29,959
Make it look like an accident.

100
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:37,935
My fee just doubled, by the way.

101
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:18,150
- Hello?
- Hi, is this Brad?

102
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,752
Yeah.

103
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,979
You came by my office
a couple days ago...

104
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:24,681
...looking for a guy
who had inheritance coming to him.

105
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:25,916
Right.

106
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:28,458
I know where he is.

107
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:33,091
She wants 2 grand first.
I'm meeting her at noon.

108
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:36,395
The card's more important, so Vegas first,
then we deal with T-Bag?

109
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,128
Shut up.

110
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:39,900
I'll stay.

111
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:43,035
All right.

112
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:47,442
Linc, take Sara and Sucre...

113
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:50,215
...and Roland to Vegas.

114
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:52,284
The rest of us...

115
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,282
...we'll handle T-Bag.

116
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:57,821
You heard the man. Let's go.

117
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:04,195
Hey.

118
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:08,029
- Promise me something, would you?
- Yeah.

119
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,929
Can you get me Carrot Top's autograph?

120
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,335
Because I just think that would make
this whole thing worthwhile.

121
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:18,702
Be safe.

122
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:29,149
Hey, yo, Vegas, bitches!

123
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:35,320
He should have the information by now.

124
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:38,992
What the hell's taking Bellick so long?

125
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,234
<i>- Yes?
- She wants more money.</i>

126
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:44,462
How much more?

127
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:47,732
<i>I don't know.
You gotta come talk to this chick.</i>

128
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,207
Hold on. Hold on.

129
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:02,383
What's going on, Bellick?

130
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,718
Believe it.

131
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,993
Sorry, guys, I walked right into it too.

132
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:10,824
Let's go, man. Go.
Go. Come on, tie them up. Go.

133
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:13,398
You have no idea
who you're working with, honey.

134
00:09:15,402 --> 00:09:18,997
Why don't we skip the theatrics
and you just tell us what you want?

135
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:22,232
I'd love to put a hole right in your head.

136
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:23,774
Tie him up.

137
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:26,310
Him too.

138
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:30,612
Let's all get in the van.

139
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:34,582
Come on. Let's all get in the van, now.

140
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:37,052
You too, Mahone.

141
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:48,794
Mahone.

142
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:50,794
Mahone.

143
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,626
I remember the day we met, pretty.

144
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:19,593
You were a scared little college boy
sitting up on those bleachers...

145
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,735
...trying to keep your ass
out of the game.

146
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:26,331
Now look at you. Cold, hard.

147
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:29,169
Like a dried-up flower
wanting to get watered.

148
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:30,640
Just tell me what you want.

149
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,509
I want to make you bleed.

150
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,743
I wanna release the sinner inside of me
that got me incarcerated so many years ago.

151
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:49,262
But it seems
you caught yourself a break, pretty.

152
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:50,925
I need you.

153
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:52,690
Now...

154
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,660
...you're gonna cooperate right quick,
or so help me...

155
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:57,827
...l'm gonna stump you
till you can't stand.

156
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:02,272
Pages. Look at them.

157
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:04,933
- Looks like some kind of map, right?
- I don't know.

158
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:07,376
You know enough to chase me down
looking for this.

159
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:08,572
Now, don't lie to me.

160
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:11,377
Whatever's in that book,
it is bigger than you and me.

161
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:13,816
What, like Scylla big?

162
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:17,051
This is not a game, Theodore.

163
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:19,624
Now, you need to tell me
who you've been talking to.

164
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:30,668
I don't need to do a damn thing.

165
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:35,565
That's the benefit of being the man
with the gun.

166
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,742
Now...

167
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:44,009
...you're gonna write down everything
that you already know about Scylla.

168
00:11:44,718 --> 00:11:46,185
And everything you learned...

169
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:49,082
...in that book.

170
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:56,329
Or I'm gonna paint these walls
with your gray matter.

171
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:03,692
Get to work.

172
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:50,709
Hello? All right, I'll be right there.

173
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,789
- Self.
- Hey.

174
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:05,295
Michael's position hasn't changed
since you called.

175
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:09,834
Bagwell's a psychopath with a plan.
He needs something from Michael.

176
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:13,131
And as long as Michael
doesn't give it to him, he'll keep breathing.

177
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:16,435
- All right, well, I'm coming with you.
- No, no, no. I got it.

178
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,441
Stick to the plan.

179
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:39,798
Forget about Maricruz. You think she didn't
know her sister was trying to set you up?

180
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,525
You better get some ass in Vegas.

181
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:45,638
We're here to copy the card,
then we leave, you got it?

182
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,407
- You heard from Michael?
- No. Why?

183
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,604
Nothing.

184
00:13:54,781 --> 00:13:57,944
I want this thing done.
Vegas ain't my town.

185
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:01,849
What a fool, huh? How could anyone
not love this place, right?

186
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:05,889
Check this out.

187
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:10,062
Right there, the Asian guy.
I know I've seen him someplace before.

188
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:36,384
So, what do you have for me?

189
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:39,047
- So, what's GATE?
- Excuse me?

190
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:40,523
It's on that box.

191
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:44,423
- Why do you wanna know?
- Just curious.

192
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:49,267
What if I was to tell you
I think you're just stalling.

193
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:53,395
Biding time till you can figure out some
MacGyver way to get your ass out of here.

194
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:59,034
You've got that gun pointed at the person
who can help you, so stop wasting my time.

195
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:03,113
Come here.

196
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:04,780
Come on.

197
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:09,718
Please don't hurt me.

198
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,087
How about her, huh?

199
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:15,626
How about her, Michael?
Any reason why I shouldn't kill her?

200
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:19,729
Let's do a test, huh?

201
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:21,761
Oh, no.

202
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:29,205
- How far gone is Michael Scofield, huh?
- Michael, just tell him what he wants.

203
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:30,934
Please.

204
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:34,309
How far gone is Michael Scofield?

205
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:37,143
Please don't let him. Please.

206
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:41,911
- When did it happen, Michael?
- Please don't let him.

207
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:44,649
When did you stop caring
about hurting people, huh?

208
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:46,286
Fox River? Sona?

209
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:50,422
You gonna keep dragging your feet
while I put a bullet in her brain?

210
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:52,258
Why don't you put that gun down?

211
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:55,333
- I'll put it down when you start writing.
- Let her go, T-Bag.

212
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:56,969
T-Bag, come on, man, let her go.

213
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:59,628
- Last chance. Three, two, one.
- T-Bag. T-Bag.

214
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:00,966
All right. All right.

215
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:10,312
The pages, they fit together.

216
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:12,910
But it's not a map.

217
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:15,585
It's a blueprint.

218
00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:18,681
For what?

219
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:29,827
Please.

220
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,440
Bellick is wearing a government-issued
ankle monitor.

221
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:45,278
My guess is that Scofield has one too.

222
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:49,044
I knew that son of a bitch
was slow-walking me.

223
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:53,222
Any minute, federal agents
could come blasting through that door.

224
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,952
So, what do we do?

225
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:58,393
I need you to get the make
and serial number off that monitor.

226
00:16:58,565 --> 00:17:00,032
Feel free to pitch in here.

227
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,794
If Scofield finds out I'm involved,
this is over.

228
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:06,496
We need to keep him on point. Now,
get out there and get that information.

229
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:13,044
- What about the agents?
- Let them come.

230
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:42,865
How do we even know
this guy's out gambling?

231
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:45,637
The guy's got $300,000 in credit
and a comp room.

232
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:48,280
He's here. Keep looking. Hey, Sara.

233
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:52,282
Hey. This may not be the best time,
but I still haven't heard from Michael.

234
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:54,579
- They must be dealing with T-Bag.
- Come on.

235
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:57,518
- What?
- Vegas just isn't your town?

236
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,626
Everything I've heard about you,
that would be a change of pace.

237
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:03,552
- I guess so.
- Lincoln?

238
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,857
Please talk to me.

239
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:09,061
- Michael told you about mom?
- No.

240
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:12,933
They were much alike.
They got the same mind.

241
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,440
As mom got older, she started to lose it.

242
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:19,875
We later found out it was a symptom
of a brain tumor. Hama...

243
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:21,445
- Hamartoma.
- Yeah.

244
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:24,049
As a kid, she got nosebleeds.

245
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:27,209
They stopped.
In her 30s, they started up again.

246
00:18:27,387 --> 00:18:30,379
She later died of a brain aneurysm.

247
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:34,854
And you're telling me this because Michael
and his mother are similar in that way too.

248
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:37,553
He had nosebleeds as a kid.

249
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:42,292
They stopped, and the last couple of days,
they started up again.

250
00:18:43,136 --> 00:18:45,434
How old was your mom
when she passed away?

251
00:18:45,605 --> 00:18:46,799
Thirty-one.

252
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:51,003
Michael's just turning 31.

253
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:57,846
- Yeah?
- I found him.

254
00:18:58,018 --> 00:19:01,351
<i>- Keep an eye on him.
- Okay.</i>

255
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,197
Andrew Blauner?

256
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,725
Yeah.

257
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:23,997
Can I help you?

258
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,238
I hope so.

259
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:35,271
Any boyfriends or roommates
I should know about?

260
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:37,106
No.

261
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:41,719
Any deliveries scheduled for today?

262
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:43,355
No.

263
00:20:49,863 --> 00:20:51,194
I'm giving you one more...

264
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,691
What is all this?

265
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:00,568
You okay?

266
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:05,304
They told me not to talk to you.

267
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:09,104
They? Who's they?

268
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:11,147
This is Whistler's blueprint.

269
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:13,376
It's the building
where we can find Scylla.

270
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:15,316
In other words, it's GATE.

271
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,321
Where's Scylla?

272
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:22,220
I can't be certain
until I see the building itself.

273
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:25,125
I'm pretty sure it's somewhere down here
below this office.

274
00:21:25,832 --> 00:21:28,995
- What is Scylla?
- It's the Company's little black book.

275
00:21:30,303 --> 00:21:32,134
I want you to take me to GATE, now.

276
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:39,906
Because you can smell that Scylla money,
can't you?

277
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:44,308
That's what you're in it for, just like me.

278
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:48,680
Say it.

279
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:51,648
Come on. I want you to say it.

280
00:21:56,863 --> 00:21:58,922
I'm in it for the money.

281
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:03,066
You see...

282
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:07,633
...we ain't so different after all.

283
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:04,288
- Yes?
- Don Self is not at his house.

284
00:23:04,464 --> 00:23:05,829
Looks like he cleared out.

285
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:10,462
Notify our people inside the bureau
and L.A.P.D.

286
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,901
I doubt that he can have gotten very far.

287
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:16,735
- Sir?
- Not now.

288
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,401
Don Self is here to see you.

289
00:23:25,852 --> 00:23:27,717
What would you like to do?

290
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:34,286
Here you go, sir.

291
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:41,694
Gotta warn you, friend, she's cold.

292
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,949
Good luck, pal.

293
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:07,622
Stay with him.

294
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:26,169
- Scofield's getting somewhere in there.
- Man works fast.

295
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:29,577
He can't get any further without seeing
my former place of employment.

296
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:32,183
Did you take care
of our little troll problem?

297
00:24:38,024 --> 00:24:41,289
Don't even think about doing this to me.
My name is on the door.

298
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:44,760
If I didn't think you were valuable,
you'd be dead already.

299
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,329
Grab a leg.

300
00:24:49,502 --> 00:24:50,992
Wait.

301
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:55,939
It's just a little sensory overload, guys.
There just wasn't any room for the card.

302
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:59,977
If we turn the device on in the casino,
it fills up on all the data from the slots.

303
00:25:00,146 --> 00:25:01,511
Yeah.

304
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:06,309
- Like when they're about to pay out.
- It's completely unintentional.

305
00:25:06,486 --> 00:25:09,455
Really? It's not why you built
the thing in the first place?

306
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:12,022
- Lf we didn't need you...
- No. But you do.

307
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:14,557
So just take a brewski and chill, all right?

308
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:17,821
Okay, we need to figure out a way
to get Scuderi alone.

309
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,726
- Yeah?
- The old man just showed up at the pool.

310
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:26,838
From what he's wearing,
there's no way he's got the card on him.

311
00:25:27,006 --> 00:25:28,303
<i>Stay with him.</i>

312
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:32,003
The card's in his room.

313
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:42,679
Tell me, Donald, how did you play
this moment out in your head?

314
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:45,380
Did you picture yourself coming in here...

315
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:49,085
...chest out, jaw squared,
ready to demand answers?

316
00:25:49,262 --> 00:25:56,259
Did you, at any time in your fantasy,
imagine that you would be this nervous?

317
00:25:56,836 --> 00:26:00,670
Honestly, I didn't think much past
giving you these.

318
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:08,277
Berlin.

319
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:09,710
Nigeria.

320
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,748
The Comrie Group.

321
00:26:13,453 --> 00:26:16,980
Why not JFK and the Lindbergh baby
while you're at it?

322
00:26:17,156 --> 00:26:21,320
Son, these matters have been fully vetted.
They're relics.

323
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:23,325
I had nothing to do with them.

324
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:25,964
If this is why
you've been pulling data on me...

325
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:28,123
...I could have saved you a lot of trouble.

326
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:30,269
Well, these records and a sealed letter...

327
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:33,872
...explaining my investigation
into your involvement with these matters...

328
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,771
...were sent to five lawyers across
the country. If anything happens to me...

329
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:41,641
...if I go missing, anything. If I wind up
dead, that letter is to be unsealed...

330
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:46,080
And they will find cold trails
that lead nowhere near me.

331
00:26:46,252 --> 00:26:49,016
It doesn't matter.
If a government agent looking into you...

332
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:52,646
...is found floating in the L.A. River
or whatever else you have planned...

333
00:26:52,825 --> 00:26:55,293
...your life, general,
will change dramatically.

334
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:58,430
There will be questions,
media coverage and surveillance.

335
00:26:58,598 --> 00:27:00,964
Whatever you and the Company
are trying to do...

336
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:03,830
...with your Laos game
or whatever else you have planned...

337
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:06,836
...will be next to impossible
with thousands of eyes on you.

338
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:08,564
Okay, so back off of me.

339
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:14,907
You are not the first person
to attempt something like this.

340
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:18,608
Most of the others,
I now fondly call my colleagues.

341
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:23,880
They've learned to put their determination
in focus to better use...

342
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:26,456
...and with far greater compensation.

343
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:28,121
Wrong guy.

344
00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:31,225
We'll see.

345
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:34,558
"Dear Mr. White,
due to unforeseen circumstances...

346
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:38,295
...I regret to inform you that I will no longer
perform services at GATE.

347
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:39,995
I thank you for this opportunity.

348
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:42,641
I am sorry if this places you
in a difficult position.

349
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:45,505
I have simply not been able
to escape these circumstances.

350
00:27:45,678 --> 00:27:48,579
Thank you for the wonderful,
enriching opportunity."

351
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:50,443
Blah, blah, blah.

352
00:27:50,616 --> 00:27:52,311
Does it sound like you?

353
00:27:53,986 --> 00:27:55,010
Yeah.

354
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:57,019
- Good.
- Yeah.

355
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,682
Look,
I don't even know who you are, okay?

356
00:28:01,227 --> 00:28:02,956
- Just let me go.
- Shut up.

357
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:10,900
And you wondered how I got to be
the top salesman in the Northeast region.

358
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,833
I'm sorry, okay?

359
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:16,674
I'm sorry.

360
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,804
Consider this a warning.

361
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,740
Oh, God.

362
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:39,793
Old Teddy Bagwell
may be Coosa County trash...

363
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:42,366
...but Cole Pfeiffer's a man of refinement.

364
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:48,197
One of the GATE Corporation's
tippy-top sellers, matter of fact.

365
00:28:49,742 --> 00:28:52,711
Step into my office.

366
00:28:56,315 --> 00:28:58,215
Well, there should be a room, 8-by-10.

367
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:02,082
- Whistler's point of entry.
- That's a closet.

368
00:29:03,923 --> 00:29:05,754
No, it's not.

369
00:29:17,436 --> 00:29:19,961
Hi. Tonic and lime, please.

370
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,300
Thank you.

371
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:26,343
I'm in the middle of a nightmare.
I wonder if you could help me.

372
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:32,249
It's my 22-year-old cousin's
bachelorette party.

373
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:35,615
- That's hardly the salt mines.
- Oh, wait for it.

374
00:29:35,788 --> 00:29:38,256
There's a scavenger hunt...

375
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:43,119
...and my team has tasked me with getting
a photograph in a whale's suite.

376
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:46,331
I'm a whale?

377
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:51,292
You have a very scary bodyguard
and a very gorgeous watch.

378
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:53,432
You wanna take a picture in my room?

379
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:56,006
I realize it's a completely
inappropriate request...

380
00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:58,575
...but they're already calling me
a wet blanket.

381
00:29:59,745 --> 00:30:02,646
I'm sorry, I just can't help you.

382
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:07,115
What if I said please?
I'm actually a little desperate.

383
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:09,151
Best of luck.

384
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:14,759
Drink's on the gentleman.

385
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:18,363
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

386
00:30:22,268 --> 00:30:24,634
Don't take it personally.
You're not his type.

387
00:30:25,304 --> 00:30:29,832
Right before you sat down,
he asked me if I like to party.

388
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:33,772
- Absolutely not. No way.
- Come on.

389
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:36,141
Take one for the team.
Maricruz will never know.

390
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:39,284
- I'm gonna snap his neck.
- Get to his room, stay two minutes.

391
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:43,513
- In the meantime, what? In the elevator?
- Play hard to get. Let him nuzzle a little bit.

392
00:30:43,923 --> 00:30:46,483
Hey, hey, whoa. What option we got?

393
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:49,723
Come on, man, what option we got?
Give me one.

394
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:51,792
You can't. Here.

395
00:31:04,143 --> 00:31:06,475
Go ahead, there's nothing back there.

396
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:09,709
I know.

397
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:29,834
Do you have anything sharp?

398
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:44,775
So, what are you hearing Scylla's worth?

399
00:31:47,386 --> 00:31:49,752
Me, I'm hearing millions.

400
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:58,562
Is that a rough ballpark
in terms of what you've been told?

401
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:17,949
What do we have here?

402
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,378
You better back up.

403
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:57,155
You and me in a dark hole.

404
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:00,258
Just like old times, pretty.

405
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:03,695
You first.

406
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:00,412
How the chips falling for you?

407
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:04,753
Spent my last buck on the beer.

408
00:34:05,724 --> 00:34:09,251
What are the options
when you're broke in Vegas?

409
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,321
I guess I gotta work that out, huh?

410
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:18,896
What if you didn't have to?

411
00:34:19,638 --> 00:34:22,436
I may have a little business
to throw your way.

412
00:34:24,009 --> 00:34:25,909
What kind?

413
00:34:31,317 --> 00:34:32,944
The easy kind.

414
00:34:33,986 --> 00:34:36,682
With a thousand-dollar payout.

415
00:34:37,723 --> 00:34:39,213
What's your cognac?

416
00:34:40,392 --> 00:34:42,053
I never had it.

417
00:34:42,728 --> 00:34:46,391
I got a 200-year-old bottle in my suite.

418
00:34:46,565 --> 00:34:48,362
Join me.

419
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:50,195
This is private business...

420
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,201
...between men.

421
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:09,543
They're on their way up.

422
00:35:10,055 --> 00:35:14,287
- Get ready.
- I love it. Mr. Macho-Man.

423
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:23,091
Well, well, well.

424
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:27,099
What's next?

425
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:30,902
I don't know. Why don't you figure it out?
I'm done helping you.

426
00:35:33,178 --> 00:35:36,909
Sounds like someone's caught
in the old captivity of negativity.

427
00:35:37,082 --> 00:35:39,073
Let's get you
in a more affirmative mindset.

428
00:35:39,251 --> 00:35:40,878
What's next?

429
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,488
I think I'm gonna lock you in this room.

430
00:35:44,556 --> 00:35:48,083
And then you're gonna be arrested
and taken back to Fox River.

431
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:52,419
Now, just how do you plan on?

432
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:04,505
Y'all have no idea what you're doing.

433
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,811
- Scofield, you can't do this without me.
- Self's on his way.

434
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,006
- Michael!
- I got your message.

435
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:13,310
Y'all have no idea what you're doing.

436
00:36:14,253 --> 00:36:16,278
Thanks, Alex.

437
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:23,727
- Great city.
- I guess so.

438
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:28,162
That's the thing about Vegas.
It doesn't judge you.

439
00:36:28,434 --> 00:36:32,393
Any form of pleasure's acceptable here.

440
00:36:40,212 --> 00:36:43,807
Am I crazy,
or is there a note of plum in there?

441
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:47,910
Maybe.

442
00:36:48,387 --> 00:36:50,014
Have a seat.

443
00:36:52,324 --> 00:36:55,259
- Did you serve?
- Serve who?

444
00:36:55,427 --> 00:36:56,758
In the military.

445
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,995
You look like a devil dog.

446
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:03,427
No, sir.
I've never been in the service before.

447
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:12,170
Filling up nice.
Sucre must be in close proximity.

448
00:37:12,344 --> 00:37:14,710
Getting oiled, most likely.

449
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:21,719
One and a half tours in Vietnam.

450
00:37:23,322 --> 00:37:27,520
Purple heart
in a friendly fire exchange near Hue.

451
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,260
I'm sorry to hear it.

452
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:42,066
What I learned at Hue...

453
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:44,405
...though valuable...

454
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,702
...also cost me a great deal.

455
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:53,980
Specifically, 3 square inches
of upper-groin thigh meat.

456
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:57,379
And with that...

457
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:02,083
...my reproductive and sexual function.

458
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:10,066
- So you can't?
- Mr. Villalobos...

459
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:12,567
...l'd like you to meet my wife.

460
00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:15,736
I'm Alexa.

461
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,942
You want me to bang your wife?

462
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:24,738
I'm gonna pay you a thousand dollars.

463
00:38:45,471 --> 00:38:47,996
He's got a minute,
then I'm going after him.

464
00:38:49,608 --> 00:38:51,633
- Did you copy the card?
- Yup.

465
00:38:52,277 --> 00:38:55,872
All right, download that.
We got five minutes.

466
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,880
- Well?
- His wife was up there.

467
00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:03,277
And?

468
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:06,888
Stays in Vegas.

469
00:39:11,163 --> 00:39:12,926
Come on, darling.

470
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:16,662
Hey, guys.

471
00:39:16,835 --> 00:39:20,293
I'm gonna go hit the head
and I'll be out in a minute, all right?

472
00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:31,707
Yes.

473
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,352
Two pulls. All right.

474
00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:41,588
Two spins.

475
00:39:50,302 --> 00:39:54,204
- There he is.
- Two pulls and he won the progressive.

476
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:59,299
- Where the hell is he?
- I'll go get him.

477
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:15,750
- Mr. Glenn.
- We got a problem.

478
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:20,787
It was made clear you were never welcome
in any Nevada gaming establishment.

479
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:25,062
- I was told there was only a five-year ban...
- No such thing was said to you.

480
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:30,464
- What's that do?
- It's a battery pack for a game console.

481
00:40:34,379 --> 00:40:36,779
You'll need to buy a new one.

482
00:40:42,888 --> 00:40:46,119
I already downloaded the card
onto my laptop.

483
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:48,487
And I can build another device.

484
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,094
You said this one takes months.
We don't have months.

485
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:54,426
You know what?
We ought to leave your ass in the desert.

486
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:57,064
Let's get back to L.A.
And let Self sort him out.

487
00:40:57,235 --> 00:40:58,634
Let's go.

488
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:12,406
No!

489
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:21,188
Michael.

490
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,294
Michael.

491
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:27,654
He has some set of lungs.

492
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,028
- How's Bellick and the girl?
- All taken care of.

493
00:41:30,202 --> 00:41:33,103
I'm gonna keep T-Bag in protective custody
until we get Scylla.

494
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:36,035
I'm gonna make somebody
at the Illinois DOC very happy.

495
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,699
But more importantly,
what was that room downstairs?

496
00:41:38,877 --> 00:41:41,710
That's not where they keep the device
that decodes Scylla?

497
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,678
No. That's just what T-Bag thought.

498
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,784
The road to Scylla
only begins down there.

499
00:41:46,952 --> 00:41:49,477
This is the room
where we've got T-Bag now.

500
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:51,850
Past the south wall,
there's an access tunnel...

501
00:41:52,024 --> 00:41:54,219
...that runs for about 300 yards or so.

502
00:41:54,393 --> 00:41:57,362
We get through that, we're in.
That's where we decode Scylla.

503
00:41:57,529 --> 00:42:00,327
- This is where General Krantz's office is.
- There you go.

504
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:03,229
I was there.
The security in that place is unbelievable.

505
00:42:03,402 --> 00:42:06,235
And according to the blueprints,
the substructure is exposed.

506
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:08,498
Shouldn't take more than 24 hours
to get in.

507
00:42:08,674 --> 00:42:10,266
It's only gonna take 24 hours?

508
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:13,605
All we have to do
is get that last card first.

509
00:42:15,347 --> 00:42:17,474
Well, based on
what I've deciphered so far...

510
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:21,312
...we're gonna need around-the-clock
access to GATE starting immediately.

511
00:42:21,486 --> 00:42:25,320
If you can get us suits and IDs, we could
go in as IRS agents auditing the books.

512
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,426
Considering the racket they're running,
nobody would have a problem believing.

513
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:32,927
- Can you make that happen?
- Yeah, I can do it.

514
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:41,071
It's under the can.

515
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:48,508
<i>- Hello?
- We have a lot in common.</i>

516
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,874
Yeah? Who is this?

517
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:53,176
<i>Just another interested party
in what you're up to.</i>

518
00:42:53,518 --> 00:42:55,679
<i>- Yeah, what's that?
- Scylla.</i>

519
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:57,719
<i>Open the envelope.</i>

520
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:03,150
The pages I've got only go up to 77.

521
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:04,522
Is this more blueprint?

522
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,256
I don't know.

523
00:43:08,066 --> 00:43:09,090
What do you want?

524
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:11,667
I don't know what you've done
with Bagwell. Unless I see him...

525
00:43:11,837 --> 00:43:13,395
...you're not getting the pages.

526
00:43:13,572 --> 00:43:16,200
- Is that right?
- Give me that.

527
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:17,432
Who is this?

528
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,105
Hello, Michael.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
