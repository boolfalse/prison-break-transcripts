00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,920
previous on prison break

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:03,990
I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,330
They got me and sara.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,750
Lj and sara will be traded for whistler.

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,850
Are we clear?

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,540
I want a picture of my son and sara to prove they're alive.

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,100
I will have a court date one of these days,and you will be there.

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,230
You're on your own.

9
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,450
Sofia lugo.

10
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,410
I'm james whistler's girlfriend

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,980
Why does he want this?

12
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,640
He's just a fisherman.

13
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,500
Tell your fisherman friend scofield's brother has this.

14
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,220
Just take the bounty off whistler.

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,880
Whistler don't mean nothing to me,man.

16
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,950
There are ways I can be of assistance.

17
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,250
Whistler's clear?

18
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,320
Clear as the blue sky,brother.

19
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,300
So,how are we getting out of here?

20
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,860
I have no idea.

21
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,680
what the hell are you doing?

22
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,190
I just... I need some money,

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,330
and I didn'T... I didn't know where else to go.

24
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,880
I've got about $50.

25
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,570
No,no.I'm talking about the millions,papi.

26
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,800
The backpack?

27
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,590
There's all sorts of cash in that thing.

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,520
Need a place to crash,I got your back,but the backpack's gone.

29
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,840
Any money I dig out is for my brother.

30
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,360
Remember him?

31
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,570
Tall guy,kind of thin.

32
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,680
Busted your ass out of jail.

33
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,480
I feel bad about mike.

34
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,550
I do,linc.

35
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,100
But not all of us got exonerated,you know.

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,810
Pretty clear on that.

37
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,140
I can't ever go home again.

38
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,840
You got problems,sucre?

39
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,970
You ain't the only one,linc.

40
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,590
That's right.

41
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,120
We're all guilty of something,man.

42
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,600
All of us.

43
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,200
Not them.

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,390
I want to help.

45
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,440
But it seems like it's only getting deeper and deeper.

46
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,280
Look,I just,I just want money to get back on my feet and that's it,linc.

47
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,210
Linc?

48
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,110
Never mind.

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,820
doesn't take too long for a man to become animal,no?

50
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,630
The smart ones go for his bunk first.

51
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,610
What do the dumb ones do?

52
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,520
Hey,I was here first.

53
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,850
Mampi bitch,you been here two days.

54
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,230
I meant I was the first one to the shoe,

55
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,940
you sack-in-the-box-- now hand it over.

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,740
You're asking for a chicken foot,friend.

57
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,900
You want this shoe?

58
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,460
You're gonna have to come and get it.

59
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,060
leave him. Leave him.

60
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,990
I just wanted to express my thanks for,uh... for whistler.

61
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,550
I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.

62
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,690
My mistake.

63
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,180
Anyway,I thought maybe we could make some kind of arrangement.

64
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,160
Maybe I could help out around sona.

65
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,290
come here,boy.

66
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,240
Leave.

67
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,330
You help me?

68
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,160
I'm the bucky massa here,boy.

69
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,480
Me.Not you.

70
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,980
So if anyone want anything at sona,it's me them will come to.

71
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,450
So do not walk in here asking for se favor like we have some understanding.

72
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,830
No,no,no,no,no.We do not.

73
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,870
The next time you roll in here like that,boy,the only thing you ask me for is mercy.

74
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,350
Si?

75
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,730
Scofield,visitor.

76
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,400
Go on,boy.

77
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,410
Now,run along,your momma calling ya.

78
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,590
That bad,huh?

79
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,100
It's not good.

80
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,150
You?

81
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,250
I followed that message you got from whistler.

82
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,810
It's all about some book.

83
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,110
- A bird guide - Any clues as about who he might be?

84
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,370
No.We weren't the only ones following his directions.

85
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,350
His girl was there,says he's some kind of fisherman.

86
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,370
Yeah,sure he is.

87
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,720
Listen,man,I,uh,I want you to check something out.

88
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,550
Oh,my god!

89
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,880
The way she's holding the paper it's like she's,

90
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,150
uh,it's like she's pointing at something.

91
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,910
It's too small I can't read it.

92
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,130
This is today's paper.

93
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,610
She's pointing at santa rita.

94
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,600
It's a small town 20 miles from here.

95
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,790
She's trying to tell us where she is.

96
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,150
I have to talk to her,linc.

97
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,500
Even if they let you talk to her,man,they'll be listening to every word you say.

98
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,310
You can't do that.

99
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,180
We're gonna need more than the name of that town.

100
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,780
I'm coming up empty-handed here,linc.

101
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,450
It's already been three days and... I got nothing to show for it.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,820
So,if I can't break whistler out of here...

103
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,700
you're gonna have to break them out of there.

104
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,030
So,what's the deal,mate?

105
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,540
When's moving day?

106
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,370
I'llell you the plan when you tell me who you are.

107
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,810
- I'm a fisherman. - Really?

108
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,300
So am I.

109
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,340
You're worried about trusting me?

110
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,880
My life is in your hands.

111
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,180
How am I supposed to know that I can trust you?

112
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,640
You don'T.

113
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,560
- Hey. - Stuart scott.

114
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,810
Number one,right?

115
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,900
You watch the sportscenter?

116
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,610
Not recently.

117
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,990
Look,I need to get my hands on a phone.

118
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,090
I need to get my hands on some pechos.

119
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,410
But that ain't gonna happen either,is it?

120
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,830
Who you got to call so important anyway?

121
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,350
Sara.

122
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,320
absolutely not.

123
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,350
It ain't a request; it's a dictation of terms.

124
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,110
My brother ain't thinking about escape till he talks to sa.

125
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,880
Aw,that's sweet.

126
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,370
I can assure you of two things,lincoln.

127
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,520
One,that sara's fine and two,you have a better chance of banging me

128
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,160
on that bar than you do of talking to her.

129
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,270
I appreciate the offer,but I'll pass.

130
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,190
- Yeah? - Yeah.

131
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,580
Oh,what if that's a dictation of terms.

132
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,280
It's not a matter of negotiation.

133
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,180
Government rip out all the phones when they find out bad men in sona still setting up deals.

134
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,060
Making bang-bangs just like before.

135
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,980
They just did it over the phone.

136
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,560
Well,if they cut the lines,maybe we can fix 'em.

137
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,220
There's nothing to fix,bro.

138
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,590
There used to be a whole row of them all along the wall,but they're gone now.

139
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,280
If you have no more questions I'm just gonna get going.

140
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,010
Michael got the bounty off whistler's head in two days.

141
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,410
That's more than your people could do in two weeks.

142
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,660
Show some goodwill.

143
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,190
He'll get his goodwill when whistler's out.

144
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,470
One thing you should know about my brother,he's very stubborn.

145
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,620
You want him to fetch,you throw him a bone.

146
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,010
How does michael think he's gonna get his hands on a phone inside sona?

147
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,780
What about cell phones?

148
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,480
With all the traffic moving in and out of here.

149
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,030
Cell phone big no-no.

150
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,720
Only one man has access to it,

151
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,710
and he wouldever let a zanahoria like you...

152
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,200
let me guess.

153
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,810
What is it?

154
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,750
The weekly from your operations on the outside.

155
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,770
Grave digger dropped it off.

156
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,210
That couldn't be.

157
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,310
This envelope way too thin.

158
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,430
Stuff just moving a little slow on the outside these days.

159
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,180
Oh,stuff moving slow.

160
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,780
Somebody making it move slower.

161
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,840
Teodoro.

162
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,690
Set up something at the barber downstairs for me now.

163
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,380
Yes,sir.

164
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,670
No problem at all.

165
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:44,030
You tell that bitch she nick me with the razor again,I'm gonna use it 'pon her.

166
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,780
you're still alive.

167
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,080
And you're still lovely.

168
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,340
Oh,please,I haven't showered ithree days.

169
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Whatever you smell like,it's a significant upgrade.

170
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,410
When I didn't hear from you,I...

171
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,140
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,570
- I warned you it might be a bit...  - I know,I know.

173
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,590
It's just... every time they dragged out a body...

174
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,920
look at me.

175
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,460
I promise you when I leave this place,it won't be like that.

176
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,150
Okay.

177
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,530
Now,were you able to find my book?

178
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,820
Yeah.

179
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,720
But there was this guy.

180
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,110
He followed me.

181
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,660
What guy?

182
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,740
I don't know.

183
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,560
Did he hurt you?

184
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,730
No,but he took it.

185
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,580
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,570
I didn't know what to do.

187
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,520
What did he look like?

188
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,370
Um... shaved head,kind of big.

189
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,670
He said to tell you that scofield's brother has it now.

190
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,150
- Who's scofield? - Okay.

191
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,000
Who's scofield?

192
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,680
Hmm? No one.

193
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,470
He's just,um... he's someone I'm working with.

194
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,850
He's gonna help me get out of here.

195
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,530
He's a lawyer?

196
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,290
Basically.

197
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,120
That's why you want him to have the book.

198
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,000
Look,sofia,the less you know about this,the safer you'll be.

199
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,930
The less I know,the less help I'll be.

200
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,320
Exactly.

201
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,570
I just need you to lay low for a while. Okay,sweetheart?

202
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,340
What the hell is going on,james?

203
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,350
What is so important about this book?

204
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,500
Nothing.

205
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,450
It just has notes in it,you know,phone numbers.

206
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,440
It's people who know people who are going to help me get out of here.

207
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
You're lying.

208
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,230
Why would I lie to you?

209
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,630
You're the only person in the world that I can trust.

210
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,730
Come here.

211
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,370
Come here.

212
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,690
Now,I just need you to trust me.

213
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,610
And do what?

214
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,590
Nothing.

215
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,980
sign out please

216
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,090
You looking for something,blanquito?

217
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,300
Yeah,yeah,I am,I am.

218
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,160
What you looking for then?

219
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,520
Just a little,uh... little something to pass the time.

220
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,090
You got paper?

221
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,800
go down to the lost and found with the rest of them.

222
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,270
They'll hook you up proper.

223
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,490
All right.

224
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,350
I find you sniffing around where you don't belong,

225
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:07,530
ll find yourselfin that ring again... against me.

226
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,530
I don't like your odds.

227
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,120
I want you to check something out,all right?

228
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,010
Look at her left hand-- like she's pointing at something.

229
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,850
Well,you'd better tell my cousin he'd better make himself available.

230
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,370
Better him short money than me short patience.

231
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,470
¿No comprende,boy?

232
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,780
I need a charge.

233
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,710
Teodoro,go on,get me laundry,no?

234
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,020
Sure thing,boss-- oh,I almost forgot.

235
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,440
Uh,I talked to the barber.

236
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,890
She's gonna squeeze you in today around 2:00.

237
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,720
If that pleases you,patróN.

238
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,480
patróN.

239
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,570
I think it's time you made good on all the bad you've done,theodore.

240
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,710
You and me,we're going to make a deal.

241
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,470
Lechero has a cell phone.

242
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,590
I need it.

243
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,730
No problem.

244
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,080
Shall I turn water into wine while I'm at it?

245
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,390
Maybe give the guy's mother a good rodgering?

246
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,410
She'd be a little old for your tastes,no?

247
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,670
Careful,pretty.

248
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,200
Don't bite the hand you trying to get fed out of.

249
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,950
I'm not looking for food,I'm looking for a favor.

250
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,910
Why the hell should I do you a favor,huh?

251
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,940
'Cause unlike your new compadres,i know who you are,

252
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,210
what you've done and who you've done it to.

253
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,450
Let me get this straight.

254
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,760
You're saying you gonna tell on me?

255
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,740
What I'm saying is: This here is a religious country,

256
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,560
and I'm willing to bet the good folks down in panama

257
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,260
don't take too kindly to rapists and pedophiles.

258
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,470
You want to bet against me?

259
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,930
Listen,mate.

260
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,700
Here's what I know so far.

261
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,780
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,

262
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,130
I know he ran into my girlfriend,and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.

263
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,900
I'd like it back.

264
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,370
What's so special about this book?

265
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,550
Well,unless it has directions out of this prison,

266
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,170
I don't think it should really matter to you.

267
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
You don't know what matters to me.

268
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,500
You can get that book back when we get out of sona.

269
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,770
Oh,yeah?

270
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,070
And when the hell is that exactly?

271
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,880
Because so far I haven't seen bollocks in the way of breaking out of here.

272
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,280
Okay.

273
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,150
Let me tell you what I know so far.

274
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,880
Some very bad people who have done some very bad things want you alive and out of this prison,

275
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,230
which is why every bone in my body is telling me to do the opposite.

276
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,450
Then why are you doing it?

277
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,370
You're upset because someone took a book from you.

278
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,800
This is what they took from me.

279
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,880
So let's be clear.

280
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,580
This is what matters to me,not you and not your book.

281
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,160
hello.

282
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,990
Cousin,how is it?

283
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,390
Hey,augusto.

284
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,540
You tell me,man.

285
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,360
Oh,business is cyclical,don dada.

286
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,670
Ebbs and flows,ebbs and flows,you know.

287
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,920
seems like there's more ebbing than flowing these days,huh?

288
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,110
You think?

289
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,030
I'm gonna tell you what I think,man.

290
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,280
I think a black heart is trying to steal my business.

291
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,980
Is taking advantage of my situation.

292
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,840
If there are mistakes have been made,all I need is some honesty,man.

293
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,450
No mistakes,patrón,I swear.

294
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,250
Well,maybe the problem isn't on the outside.

295
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,400
Maybe the problem is... augusto.

296
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,940
Augusto?

297
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,130
battery dead.

298
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,410
The bloodfire!

299
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,090
How me phone come unplugged?

300
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,700
My battery dead.

301
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,580
None of you know nothing,huh?

302
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,130
mr.Mahone?

303
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,550
Raul darinda.

304
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,350
I am the public defender appointed to your case.

305
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,360
That's,uh... uh,that's great,that's great.

306
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,220
I-I've been putting together some notes that I...

307
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,060
looks like I have some great news.

308
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,980
We got you a trial date.

309
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,230
that's really... th-thank god.Thank god-- when?

310
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,590
June 13.

311
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,230
Oh,no,no,wait,wait,wait,th-the... 13th,13th,that was last week.

312
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,620
What,we missed it?

313
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,110
June 13 of next year,mr.Mahone.

314
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,670
Next year.

315
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,510
How the hell is that great news?

316
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,480
It usually takes two and a half years for a non-citizen to get before a judge.

317
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,760
I've got a guy in,in here,his name is michael scofield and,

318
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,460
and he will testify that he set me up

319
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,030
and that he put the drugs on the boat.

320
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,250
- Which will all be taken into consideration... - a year from now!

321
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,430
I'm going to have to ask you to calm down,mr.Mahone.

322
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,790
it's open and shut.

323
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,790
It's a no-brainer for you.

324
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,960
- I got a guy who can cop to... - the notion of one inmate taking

325
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,840
the fall for another is not exactly fresh

326
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,060
and usually means someone was pressured into the confession.

327
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,020
Well,here's the thing,raul.

328
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,410
I require a certain medication that they,well,

329
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,870
they just don't provide here,and I am...

330
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,670
Let's just say that it would be good for everybody if,um,

331
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,110
if I got this medication.

332
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,710
Is that a threat?

333
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,720
No.No,it's a reality,it's,it'S...

334
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,280
it's called varatril and,and,and if you...

335
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,100
look,if you are asking me to smuggle drugs into this prison,then...

336
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,010
no,no,I'm not... I'm not asking you to smuggle it.

337
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,950
- I'm just saying if you could get... - good luck,mr.Mahone.

338
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,560
So... wait,you son of a bitch!

339
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,470
Uh,boss,it's almost 2:00.

340
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,470
All right.

341
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,710
You want your cell phone,brother?

342
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,940
No,just be a half hour.

343
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,690
Leave it for charge.

344
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,740
*******

345
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,620
if that phone ain't back on the cradle,we're both dead,you hear me?

346
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,070
'Cause my alabama ass is not going down alone.

347
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,520
Yeah?

348
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,560
Tell sara to call me at this number.

349
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,860
All right,but this susan chick,she hasn't even agreed to it yet,man.

350
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,040
What?

351
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,580
I only have 25 minutes with this phone,linc.

352
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,990
I'm meeting her right now,but listen,santa rita ain't a one-horse town.

353
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,530
I mean,god,I hope that sara can give us some kind of clue as to where...

354
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,160
just get her on the line.Ju get her on the line,okay?

355
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,950
This is a one-shot deaL.

356
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,500
Yeah,I know,man.

357
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,390
23 mutes.

358
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,930
I'm nearly there.

359
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,140
Hey,looks like we got off on the wrong foot here.

360
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,140
I'm not a violent guy.

361
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,000
It's just that I need that shoe.

362
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,010
I can't hardly walk,and this place-- it changes people.

363
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,040
Oh,I never even got your name.

364
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,510
Pistachio.

365
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,070
Pistachio?

366
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,110
Now,that's just... that's a beautiful name.

367
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,410
What you want then?

368
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,210
Well,I was hoping we could make some kind of a deal.

369
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,340
Trade.

370
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,970
The only thing you got to sell,me no want to buy.

371
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,280
I like me men a little more... how you say,uh... ?

372
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,420
- Not fat. - Fat?This is all muscle.

373
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,910
And I'd prove it to you if I didn't think you'd take things south of the border.

374
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,750
Now,hold on.This is a negotiation.

375
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,940
- You don't have to... - I no gonna cut you.

376
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,570
I got clients.

377
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,350
Get.

378
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,480
Welcome,patróN.

379
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,420
I'm so honored to have you.

380
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,290
Let's make this quick.

381
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,800
Where the hell have you been?

382
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,020
Well,a girl's got to look her best.

383
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,520
This ain't a game,sister.

384
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,070
You'd better back the hell up.

385
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,380
It's becoming pretty clear you need us,so stop pretending you're in charge,

386
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,410
and give us what we want when we want it.

387
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,780
Starting with the damn phone call.

388
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,910
hello?

389
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,550
It's me.

390
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,620
How are you?

391
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,920
I'm tired.Where...?

392
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,260
- Where are you? - It's a long story.

393
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,840
As it turns out,I don't appear to be going anywhere.

394
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,740
I know.I know.

395
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,700
I'm working on that.

396
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,920
Listen,sara,I miss how we used to talk.

397
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,670
Do you remember... how we used to talk?

398
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,960
Yes.

399
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,360
Oh,good.

400
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,100
Good,because I saw your picture t tay,and I want you to know I understand...

401
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,430
I understand the difficult place you're in.

402
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,430
Michael,listen,I... I don't want you to think like that.

403
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,300
Why is that?

404
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:27,610
You have to know it's a lost cause.

405
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,160
Lj and I-- we can see it now.

406
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,900
It's a lost t use.

407
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,500
Do you understand?

408
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,890
No,no.No,I... I don'T.I don'T.

409
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
Help me understand.Help me understand.

410
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,650
All I can think of to help is,maybe you just need more time?

411
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,980
It's like... it's like they're giving you until midnight,and I'm sitting here at 3:00 A.M.

412
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,080
they're saying I have to hang up.

413
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,100
Sara,I loveveou.

414
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,810
I love you,toO.

415
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,630
Sara?Sara?!

416
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,860
Linc,they were never in santa rita.

417
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,380
What?

418
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,570
She said it was a lost cause.

419
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,840
She said she could see it was a lost cause.

420
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,580
So?

421
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,310
The patron saint of lost causes is saint rita.

422
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,720
She was never telling us where they were.

423
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,870
She was telling us what they could see from where they were.

424
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,610
He's on his way.

425
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,250
We need to get that phone back,like,r*pido.

426
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,110
One more thing,linc.

427
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,770
Come on,pretty!

428
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,310
Stall them!

429
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,280
She said,it's like they were giving us until midnight,but she was sitting at 3:00 A.M.

430
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,350
What the hell does that mean?

431
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,090
I don't know.

432
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,010
Maybe they're near a clock or something.That's all I got.

433
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,170
Listen,I got to go.

434
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,520
It's up to you.

435
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,400
leave him alone,huh?

436
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,430
Lechero!

437
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,630
There's something you should know.

438
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,010
What?

439
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,550
I think that barber might have...

440
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,550
uh... cut me?

441
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,380
No.No.My mistake.

442
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,090
I... you know,in fact,that-that there might just be the best shave I have ever seen.

443
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,090
Boy,you look like you need one today.

444
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,790
I might just do that.

445
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,290
Can't be walking around,looking all,uh,bhuttu.

446
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,260
Butu.

447
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,630
¿Que paso,jefe?

448
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,590
who is this?

449
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,330
find out everything you can about this number.

450
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,070
Don't move.

451
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,960
I want to know what the hell you're doing to james whistler.

452
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,390
I'm doing nothing to james whistler.

453
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,580
Listen,we're on the same team,all right?

454
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,530
Take it easy.

455
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,930
Just... put the knife away.

456
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,210
Put the knife away.

457
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,490
Put... the knife away.

458
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,740
We're not on the same team.

459
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,960
You want your boy out of sona,right?Right?

460
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,190
Of course.

461
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,950
Well,I'm one of the guys who's going to break him out.

462
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,060
No.No.I talked to him this morning.

463
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,040
He has a lawyer.

464
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,660
I don't know what he's told you,or who he is.

465
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,000
- I know who he is. - Right.

466
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:40,730
A fisherman that people want out so badly they're willing to kidnap my son to get him.

467
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,770
Listen,you need to talk to him.

468
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,970
******

469
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,270
Where to,my friend?

470
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,830
I'm looking for a statue,a monument.

471
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,450
Uh,santa,santa rita.

472
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,770
- Says it's in here some... - the lady of the lost causes.

473
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,510
Yeah,that's it.

474
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,830
The red light district.

475
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,340
- ****You looking to party? - Yeah.

476
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,770
You all right?

477
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,690
What do you want?

478
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,230
Let you know you don't have to watch your back.

479
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,850
Make sure I don't have to watch mine.

480
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,440
My head was a free ticket out of here.

481
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,630
Don't begrudge anyone who did what they had to do to try and get it.

482
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,760
Besides... ...

483
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,910
you,uh,never know when you'll need a friend in this place.

484
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,960
where are you from?

485
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,350
Boardman,ohio.

486
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,300
Kalbarri.

487
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,180
Australia.

488
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,220
Good fishing.You've been?

489
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,820
Passed through.

490
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,180
Small world.

491
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,820
What the hell are you doing in panama?

492
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,050
I'm not really in the mood.

493
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,900
You're that cop,are you?

494
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,050
You know,I was looking at that scofield.

495
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,540
I was trying to figure why he looked so bloody familiar.

496
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,320
Then,just now,hearing your voice,

497
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,580
I remember watching the press when that first happened.

498
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,520
And now you're in here together.

499
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,180
Small world.

500
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,070
You trying to get him out of here?

501
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,390
Extradition or what?

502
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,480
I'm not really in that line of work anymore.

503
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,410
What's he all about?Scofield.

504
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,230
I mean,is he dangerous?

505
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,790
what's it to you?

506
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,630
Just curious... as to what kind of chap I'm dealing with.

507
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,210
I guess that depends on why you'd be dealing with him.

508
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,540
Like I said...

509
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,060
- you never know when you'll... - need a friend.

510
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,020
Yeah.

511
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,870
See,one thing about scofield is that,for those that he cares about,

512
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,400
he'll do just about anything.

513
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,500
But he'll screw you three ways to sunday if he doesn'T.

514
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,040
I can guess which side you ended up on.

515
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,370
Well...

516
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,700
thanks for the chat.

517
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,610
You know,I really just came by...

518
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,830
no,you came by 'cause you wanted to find out more about scofield,but that's cool.

519
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,470
We're squared away.

520
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,870
There.She is there.

521
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,200
That the only thing about saint rita in this town?

522
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,570
That I do not know,my friend.

523
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,480
Excuse me?Is there a clock around here?

524
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,380
A clock,uh... no.No comprendo.

525
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,130
excuse me?Have you seen these people?Huh?

526
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,460
- No? - No.

527
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,730
Clock.

528
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,240
Clock.

529
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,670
She said,it's like they were giving us until midnight.

530
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,960
Give us till 12.

531
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,720
But she was sitting at 3:00 A.M.

532
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,790
Three...

533
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,120
sara.

534
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,030
Dad!

535
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,460
Dad!Dad!Dad!

536
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,180
Lj!

537
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,610
Sara!

538
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,240
Hello?

539
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,300
When?

540
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,960
It was the right place.I just couldn't get to it in time.

541
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,200
Did you see them?Do they look all right?

542
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,620
As far as I could tell,yeah.

543
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,270
You can keep that.

544
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,320
Keep it as a souvenir and give it to sara when this is all done.

545
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,860
Michael,we can do this.

546
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,920
They wouldn't have gone to all this trouble to put you in here  if it wasn't possible to get out.

547
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,820
We can do this.

548
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,180
We can do it.

549
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,630
I think we need to talk.

550
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,640
Your friend,the one in the picture,you say she's the reason you're here?

551
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,630
Then we have something in common.

552
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,140
The woman your brother met on the outside,her name is sofia.

553
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,660
She's the reason I'm here.

554
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,120
Well,unless this sofia is being held at gunpoint,we got nothing in common.

555
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,310
But maybe you can start by telling me  why the company's so interested in you.

556
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,200
What company?

557
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,820
I don't have time for games.

558
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,120
Okay,okay,look.

559
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,410
Look,I've been splitting time between here  and the pacific northwest running charters.

560
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,430
- Fishing? - Fishing,sightseeing--

561
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,660
whatever was paying the bloody rent.

562
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,480
Now,about a year ago,I took a guy out.

563
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,130
He was some sort of naturalist.

564
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,910
He was,uh... he was taking water samples,measurements.

565
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
- What for? - I don't know.

566
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,910
I didn't really care as long as the check cleared,but here's the thing.

567
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,530
A few months later,I get a call from somebody wanting to know where I took the guy.

568
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,280
And I told them I couldn't remember.

569
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,640
But then these,um... then these government types,

570
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,840
they started showing up at my flat asking questions, and I didn't know what to do.

571
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,280
So I got low,I came down to panama,and I moin with sofia full time.

572
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,600
- Until... - until the fight at the bar.

573
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,850
Yeah,and then I end up here,where those same people show up at visitation

574
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,490
saying they're going to get me out.

575
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:14,070
And when they do,I'm to take them to the same place that I took that guy.

576
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,060
That's why I need the book your brother copped.

577
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,470
It's my trip log.

578
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,690
I write notes in the margins,you know,coordinates,landmarks.

579
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,380
I need to retrace my steps and find that location.I don't have a choice.

580
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,150
That's a really interesting story, but if that book's as valuable as you say it is,

581
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,910
maybe I should hold onto it for a little while, make sure they hold up their end of the deal.

582
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,620
You don't get this,do you?

583
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,790
I need time to be able to...

584
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,660
the only thing I'm responsible for is getting you out of here.

585
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,610
Whatever's between you and them is between you and them.

586
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,950
I'm sorry.

587
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,510
All right.

588
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,550
Do you have any idea how we're going to dthis?

589
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,470
All I keep hearing is how no one gets out of this place.

590
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,050
I think I've heard that one before.

591
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,300
The sugarcane's so sweet.

592
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,140
The mangoes' so sweet,the women so...

593
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,750
well,if it isn't the entertainer.

594
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,250
How about a joke for us,boy?

595
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,630
Not now,fellas,I got to get...

596
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,460
why don't you do a little dance for us,huh?How about a little jig,huh?

597
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,050
Maybe you need an extra hand?

598
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,040
you got me.

599
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,770
Yeah,that's right.

600
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,270
I do get you,boy.

601
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,850
You might've fooled him,but you're not fooling me.

602
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,830
excuse me,boss.

603
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,500
I asked you for privacy.

604
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:45,100
Just came in here to,to... thank you for giving me a hand up in here,

605
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,190
but if it's all the same,I'd just like to be relieved of my duties.

606
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,440
What are you talking about?

607
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,450
There's some,um... loyalty issues going on,

608
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,330
and I do not want to end up rn between my fidelity to you

609
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,200
and the reality of having to keep my nose clean.

610
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,790
I've been around long enough to know that when the dominoes start falling,

611
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,410
it's the new guy that gets blamed for bumping the table.

612
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,110
You better stop spinning and start talking straight.

613
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,660
No!

614
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,540
I ain't no rat.

615
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,410
I'm not asking you to be... a rat.

616
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,770
I'm asking you to be a friend,huh?

617
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,190
As i've been with you.

618
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,480
okay.

619
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:32,190
I was walking earlier,and I heard some voices talking about,to hell with lechero.

620
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,030
I want my cut.

621
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,320
" Now,I couldn't tell who it was,but when I got around the corner,

622
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,140
I recognized the faces-- the very same faces I've seen in this room.

623
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,960
Now,I got nothing to gain here,okay?

624
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:49,440
I'm a nobody w-with no hope of being anyone.

625
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:56,370
but those that surround you have everything to gain if you fall.

626
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,120
I hope this makes us even.

627
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,480
But what I've given you... can't be repaid with one favor.

628
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:18,170
So I deny your request,and you're going to stay on as my ears.

629
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:23,200
You'll report back to me everything you hear when I'm not around.

630
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,580
How've you been,michael?

631
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,910
Better than some,apparently.

632
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:09,970
You know,it's interesting how you don't seem rattled  at all by our current accommodations.

633
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,870
Could it be because maybe you're not planning on being in them much longer?

634
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,970
It's like I told you before,alex,this is the end of the line...  For both of us.

635
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,380
How about this?

636
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,970
You stop me when I'm wrong.

637
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,020
The company wanted you here in panama alive,but framed for murder,

638
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,460
and then for some strange reason,you seemed to really  care about the fate of this whistler guy,

639
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,920
and I got to tell you something,he's really curious about you,too.

640
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,060
Let's see,what special talents do you have  that the company might make the decision

641
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,090
that you're worth more to them alive than dead?

642
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,400
Huh,what do you say there,mike?Am ietting warm yet?

643
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,450
I think you better pop another pill,'cause that's crazy.

644
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,490
Oh,so you don't mind if I kill him?

645
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,200
Whistler?

646
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,190
I think the question is,"what would the company mind?

647
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,900
" The question is,"what would they do to you?

648
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,760
" To the ones you love?

649
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,250
Be careful,alex.

650
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,110
yeah?

651
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,680
Busy day?

652
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,330
Not as busy as I'd hoped.

653
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,790
Look,you had to try.

654
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,120
I probably would've done the same thing myself if I were you.

655
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,640
But let's be perfectly clear.

656
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,550
You're never going to try anything like that again.

657
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,000
I understand.

658
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:19,700
Yeah,but just to make sure that you do, I left you a little something in the garage.

659
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,740
It's by the trash.
