00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,700
I just want to go.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,000
It's okay.

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,200
Be careful, Alex.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,900
- Were you able to find my book?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,700
But there was this guy.

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,600
He took it.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,700
He said to tell you

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,500
that Scofield's
brother has it now.

<i>I left you a little something

19

What's so interesting out there,
other than our freedom?

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,600
Vine's alive, so the fence
is dead. No current.

21
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,900
WHISTLER:
Yeah? Everyone in here knows
that fence doesn't work,

22
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,000
and it doesn't mean
a bloody thing,

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,100
because there are soldiers
out there

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,200
that'll shoot you dead before
you get within 30 yards of it.

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,400
Well, I guess I got a lot
of work to do, don't I?

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,000
Listen, mate, I get
what you're doing with my book.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,100
They hold your girlfriend,
you hold what they want.

Countering needs.

29
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,700
Soon those bastards
are going to ask me

30
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,300
what progress I've made in
figuring out what they want,

31
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,300
and I'm going to say nil, 'cause
Lincoln Burrows has the book.

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
You know what?

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Threatening the brother

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,000
of the guy who's supposed
to get you out of here

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,200
might not be the smartest move.

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,100
I'm not threatening--
we're on the same team.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,600
But if we play games
with that book,

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,900
people who want me out of here
will take action against us all.

only inaction."

Now, like I said,
I got a lot of work to do.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
Linc, you alright?

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,500
I'm sorry, man.

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,600
Just all this stuff--
it's starting to get to me.

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
You know?

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,600
Listen, our situation could
change very, very soon.

47
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,200
The grave digger for the prison.

48
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,000
I need you to reach out to him.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,300
And tell him what?

50
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,600
It's all written down.

51
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,200
But we got to
get started now.

52
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,200
What are you
not telling me?

53
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,900
All these people

54
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,500
that have been hurt
because of me.

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,500
You know, it's...

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm so sorry, Michael.

57
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,800
They did this, not you.

58
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,900
Okay?

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,700
It's not your fault.

60
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,900
(sighs)
Just get to the grave digger.

61
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,900
I feel like we're
running out of time.

Prison Break
Season 03 Episode 04

65
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
I am just a soldier
in this war, Lincoln,

66
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
just like you.

67
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,500
I did not want
to do that.

68
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,400
Can you even comprehend
the intimacy

69
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,800
of the mechanics of what
I had to do to that woman?

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,100
It's horrible!

71
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,000
Now, if you and your brother
are done playing games,

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,400
LJ will be fine.

73
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,700
If not, the last thing
I want to do

74
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
is start mailing pieces
of him to you.

75
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,100
But if you push me,

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,900
and not even that far, I will.

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,200
I'll do anything you want.

78
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,600
Just don't hurt my son.

79
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,900
That's really up to you.

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
I know the past few days
have been hard,

81
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,700
for me, as well.

82
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,300
If you want to talk about it,

83
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,500
I know
what this pain feels like.

84
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,100
I just want to get
your boy out of Sona

85
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,500
and get my son back.

86
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,900
Michael's got a plan.

87
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,100
I need details.

88
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,300
We need to
bring someone

89
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,200
who works at the prison
onto the team.

90
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,400
- Who?
- The grave digger.

91
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,500
Get it done.

92
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,000
Lincoln, I'm going
to need that book.

93
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,600
The Company did handwriting
analysis on the one you gave me,

94
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
and yours hasn't changed
since high school.

95
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,100
Just soldiers, Linc.

96
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,700
Different armies,
but soldiers just the same.

97
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,300
Nice.

98
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,500
I was the best
in my school.

99
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,600
All-girls?

100
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,900
(Laughs)
Kiss my ass,bro.

101
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
20 bucks says
you can't do that again.

102
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
- Bet.
- Wait.

103
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,000
Adjust for wind.

104
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,100
Shut up.

105
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Just a bit outside.

106
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,900
<i>Hey, bro, you know I don't have
that kind of verde lying around.</i>

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,800
It's going to
take a while.

108
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,900
Well, the thing is,
I don't have a while.

109
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,500
- So, unless...
- No, no more favors.

110
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,300
All right.

111
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,200
Can I borrow
that cross of yours?

112
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,700
- I'll take it in trade.
- My dad gave me this.

113
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,600
Besides, it's not
even real gold.

114
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,700
That's why I need it.

115
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
Look, I'll give it back, okay?

116
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,300
It's just for awhile.

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,700
Come on.I got to go.

118
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,200
This time,
I want to know why.

119
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
It's light again.

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Someone's getting fat off
of everything I built

121
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,000
while I rot in here.

122
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,400
MARY:
Don't get upset, Patrón.

123
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,600
I only have
a few more hours.

124
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,900
Let's be nice.

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,200
This motherless bitch.

126
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,000
Alex?
(Gasps)

127
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,700
You just get here?

128
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,500
Yes.

129
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,300
Listen,

130
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,900
I've been thinking
about our little talk,

131
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,000
and, uh, you're in.

132
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,900
I'm in.

133
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,800
Okay.

134
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,800
- Just like that?
- Right.

135
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
I really don't have a choice,
do I?

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,800
What's the plan?

137
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,900
I'm working on it.

138
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,500
Meanwhile,
I could use your help.

139
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,400
What do you need?

140
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,100
A black felt-tipped pen.

141
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
- A pen?
- Yeah.

142
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,200
- Why?
- Some documents

143
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,500
that need altering.

144
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,400
I'll explain it to you later,
but right now, I need that pen.

145
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
- Okay?
- Yeah.

146
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
And I'll tell you
what else I need.

147
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
I need you to get
your act together.

148
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,500
I need you to bring yourself

149
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,800
under control, because
you're attracting attention,

150
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,900
and that, we don't need.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,500
I'm under control.

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,100
Of course you are.

<i>MAN:

156

Fix it.

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,400
I'm a truck driver.

158
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Hey, Alex.

159
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,100
Hey, glad I found ya.
Just wanted to see how

160
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,500
- you're holding up in here.
- Just dandy.

161
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,900
Yeah, well, I've been having
a tough time of it myself.

162
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,000
And I was figuring, it
shouldn't be that way

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,900
for us, seeing as how
we're the only lawmen here

164
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,000
in Taco Hell.

165
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,300
Hey, whoa,
hang on a second there, Alex.

166
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,600
You and me--
we were a team

167
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
on the outside,
remember?

168
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
I was your dog, and
I still got a lot
of bark left in me.

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,400
I'm busy, Brad.
What do you want?

170
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,700
You and Scofield-- you're
up to something, right?

171
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,600
You can tell me, one
badge to another.

172
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I can help.

173
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
Do you have a black
felt-tipped pen?

174
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,200
Not on me.

175
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,400
Then you can't help me.

176
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,100
I know.

177
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,900
You know what?

178
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,700
I know you're trying
to escape from here

179
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,300
with that man, Scofield.

180
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
- Sweetheart...
- Please, don't lie to me.

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Lincoln Burrows, he
told me everything.

182
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,600
There are some very powerful
people that want me out of here.

183
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,400
- And they want those
brothers to get me out.
- Why?

184
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,300
I'm not sure.

185
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,000
Has something to do
with a charter I did in Seattle.

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,500
What I do know
is their end game

187
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,200
is exactly the same as ours, and
that's me out of this hellhole.

188
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,600
And once that happens,

189
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,400
you and I will
disappear... forever.

190
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
But I don't want
to involve you in this mess.

191
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,600
I want to help.

192
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,300
That's way too dangerous.

193
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm not asking
your permission, James.

194
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm telling you.

195
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,700
I can do this on my own,

196
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,100
or you can tell
me what you know

197
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,700
and we can work it
through together.

198
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,400
I don't understand everything
that's going on,

199
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,700
but these brothers,
they're obviously trying

200
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,300
to find out what
they can about me.

201
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,100
Let's see what we can
discover about them.

202
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,200
Find out what their plan is,
see what they're all about.

203
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,300
They're trying to get you out,
and you don't trust them?

204
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,300
I don't trust any of these guys.

205
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,700
And you shouldn't, either.

206
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,100
If you insist
on getting into this,

207
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,800
promise me you'll be careful.

208
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,400
Because God
knows I will die

209
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,800
if anything happens to you.

210
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,900
Hey.

211
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
MAHONE: Michael.

212
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,200
Here.

213
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,500
I said I need a
black felt-tipped pen.

214
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
That's black.

215
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,400
It's not what I need.

216
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,100
Keep looking.

217
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,800
<i> He's playing you.</i>

218
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,600
<i>He's playing you.</i>

219
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,700
<i>Do not trust him.</i>

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Your amigo, the American.

221
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,500
He's a builder,
an engineer, no?

222
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
He's no amigo
of mine, boss.

223
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,000
And trust me,
you do not want

224
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
to get under the covers
with that...

225
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,900
Is he or is he not an engineer?

226
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,200
Well, yeah, but...

227
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Scofield.

228
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,800
Yeah?

229
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,200
What do you know
about the electricity?

230
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,900
Only that we don't
have any right now.

231
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,000
Let me tell you something.

232
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,600
This phone keeps all the food
coming to the gate.

233
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
It keeps my business running,
it keeps Sona running.

234
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,900
Electricity die,
phone die.

235
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,800
- Phone die, we die.
- We die or you die?

236
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,600
Boy, you have enough

237
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,200
education, but you're
not being smart.

238
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,100
Now, I come to you,
that is an opportunity.

239
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,100
Be wise and
take advantage.

240
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,800
Now, can you fix the electricity

241
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,100
just like you
fixed the water?

242
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,600
It's not that simple.

243
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,400
The water pipes
are inside the prison.

244
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,700
The electrical lines are
probably running underground

245
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,600
along an exterior wall,

246
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,400
which means
they're out there somewhere

247
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,200
in no-man's-land.

248
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,700
So, you can fix the power?

249
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Last I checked, they shoot
prisoners who go out there.

250
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,500
So I'm thinking
the answer is "No".

251
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,100
You listen to me,

252
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,300
and you listen closely,
water boy.

253
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,600
Like it or not,
soldiers or not,

254
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,900
You're going out
into no-man's-land.

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,400
<i>MICHAEL:
It's a suicide mission.</i>

256
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,700
<i>LECHERO:
I'll make some calls.</i>

257
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,900
- And you're going to
keep me safe?
- As best I can.

258
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,200
I don't think
I can do this.

259
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,200
No, no, no, no, no.
You will help me with this.

260
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,000
Look, I will do
something for you.

261
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,300
I'll get you a new pillow,

262
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,400
goose-feather like mine,
or a small TV.

263
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,800
All right.

264
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,200
Get me that.

265
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,100
- Why?
- It's the first one to get
sunlight in the morning.

266
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,100
You get me that cell,
I'll get you electricity.

267
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Hey, Linc.

268
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Look, bro, um, I'm going to be
out of your way real soon.

269
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,300
I saw these flyers for
migrant workers in Colombia.

270
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,500
It's coffee bean season,

271
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,900
and they're letting
Panamanians in,

272
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,900
so I figure,
with a good ID, I can pass.

273
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,400
Bus leaves today, okay?

274
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,400
All right, well, before you
get out of here, man, I...

275
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,100
I'm meeting someone,
and I need a translator.

276
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Linc, uh... I appreciate
everything you've done...

277
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,100
It'll just be a couple hours.

278
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,500
Just a couple hours,
that's it.

279
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,100
When I was 15, my cousin told me
about a job that only lasts

280
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,700
a few hours and, uh,
I got three months in juvie.

281
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,100
I can't do this without you.

282
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm in Panama,
I don't speak the language...

283
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,600
And I can't miss that bus.

284
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,500
I'm going to make money
and send it home.

285
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,200
Underground or not,
I'm going to be a dad, Linc,

286
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,400
and you out of all people
should understand that.
(Knock at door)

287
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,100
I spoke to James.

288
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,100
He confirmed what you told me

289
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,400
about the escape.

290
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,800
You and I,
we both have people in there

291
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
we care about.

292
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,800
Please... let me help you.

293
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,400
Your Spanish as good
as your English?

294
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
<i>LECHERO:
Yes, Colonel.</i>

295
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
I just have one favor to ask.

296
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,400
It's just outside
of the gate.

297
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,400
You, you can bring your men.

298
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
The phone is dying.

299
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,200
Make him one.

300
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,900
This is it?

301
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,200
Not everyone has it yet.

302
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,400
We let credit go a week,
and there is still time.

303
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,200
<i>The money's in your
veins, addicto.</i>

304
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,900
<i>No, patrón. I don't use anymore.
I swear to you.</i>

305
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,600
I swear to you

306
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,500
I swear to you.
I swear to you.

307
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,600
Chin up,
pal o' mine, Chin up.

308
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,500
<i>Sí, Colonel.</i>

309
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Yes, thank you, Colonel.

310
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,300
We'll be right there.

311
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,500
Come with me.

312
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,200
Excuse me.
Do you, um...

313
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,800
Do you have a-a, a pen?

314
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,500
Pen. Pen. Not, um...

315
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,000
Not... not the brush

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,600
but the pen. Pen. Pen.

317
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
<i>No,  pintura.</i>

318
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,100
<i>Yeah, yeah, pintura. Yeah.</i>

319
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,100
<i>He's leaving you.</i>

320
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,400
<i>He's leaving you,
he'll be gone,</i>

321
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,300
<i>and you'll be stuck
in this maze... forever.</i>

322
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,700
Thank you for arranging
this for us, Colonel.

323
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,300
I'm getting something
out of this as well,

324
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,400
I assure you.

325
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,700
You know you can fix
this electric problem?

326
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I won't know for sure
until we can start digging,

327
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,300
but yes, I think so.

328
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,000
My men will

329
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,600
shoot you in the
back of the head

330
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,100
if you so much as
look at the fence, eh?

331
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,600
And you, patrón, if
anything goes wrong.

332
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,700
it will not only be
his life that is lost.

333
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,300
You have my word on that.

334
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,900
No worries, Colonel.

335
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,500
I'll keep this boy in line.

336
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,800
I'll dig.

337
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't need your help.

338
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,500
Hey, come on, now,
don't be proud.

339
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,700
I heard you talking
just yesterday.

340
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,900
Talking to Mahone.

341
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,800
You know, about how
us Americans should
stick together.

342
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,300
So I help you now,
and I'm sure you'll

343
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,500
help me down the
road, right, Mikey?

344
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,800
What is it,
a '66 or a '67?

345
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,700
-<i>Perdon</i>
-Your car.

346
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,000
<i>El quiere saber
el ano.</i>

347
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,900
<i>Este aqui</i>

348
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,400
<i>Pues, es un '66.</i>

349
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,600
<i>Yes mi preciosa.</i>

350
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,800
'66.

351
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Uh-huh.
What is it, 325 horses?

352
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,700
<i>SOFIA:
Caballos de fuerza</i>

353
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,700
375.

354
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,100
<i>Perdon a me, señorita.
Mm-hmm.</i>

355
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,200
- What's he saying?
- He recognizes me, but

356
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,100
he doesn't realize
it was at the prison.

357
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,400
Ask him does he want
to make enough cash

358
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,200
to get this car cherry
by next week?

359
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,100
He knows we're not
talking about cars.

360
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's right.

361
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,300
BELLICK:
Come on, Scofield, I know
you're getting out of here.

362
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,900
I heard it all about
you and the limey.

363
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm just fixing the
electricity, Boss.

364
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,800
Yeah, right, and I'm just
single 'cause I'm choosy.

365
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,000
Don't make me tell
anyone what I know.

366
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,300
What is it you think you know?

367
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,100
Somebody called "The Company"
wanted you in here

368
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,500
to work with that
Whistler guy.

369
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
- Am I warm?
- What's the Company?

370
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,700
What do they want
with Whistler?

371
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,100
I don't know, but you do.

372
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,300
Doesn't sound like you
know much after all.

373
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,100
I don't need to know

374
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
how to change a diaper

375
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,100
to know when it
stinks to high hell.

376
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,200
You're doing something
here, Scofield.

377
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,600
You're right. I am.

378
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
I'm fixing the electricity.

379
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,200
Now, you wanted to help dig?

380
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
Dig.

381
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,000
Hey, this is it.

382
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
I assume we're doing more than
just than playing electrician.

383
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,300
Don't worry.

384
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,900
We're exactly
where we need to be.

385
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,300
Heat's getting to me, Scofield.

386
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
It's quitting time.

387
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,600
You mind telling me why he's
even out here with us?

388
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,100
He knows something's up.

389
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,400
How the hell does he know that?

390
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,900
Let's just say I have
a bit of a rep.

391
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
From Fox River?

392
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,100
I know who you are, mate.

393
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,900
Figured it out just lately.

394
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,300
Finally made sense
why they pick you

395
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,600
of all people to send here.

396
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,000
No worries.

397
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,900
It's in my interest to keep
your little secret.

398
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,600
But Bellick?

399
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,300
Can't be trusted.

400
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,900
I can handle Bellick.

401
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,200
He's not in on this.

402
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,600
Okay, good.

403
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,900
But Mahone is.

404
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,600
Mahone?

405
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,400
He's looking about as stable
as a three-legged chair,

406
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
and he's escaping with us?

407
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,000
No, he just thinks he is.

408
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,000
He needs his meds.

409
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,700
Without them,
he'll self destruct.

410
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,200
It's just a matter of time.

411
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,300
And if he doesn't?

412
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,200
I'll string him along,
tell him what he wants to hear,

413
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,500
and then I'll
cut him loose.

414
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,400
How do I know you're not going
to do the same thing to me?

415
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
You don't.

416
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,200
You need a hook-up,
my friend?

417
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,900
No.

418
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,000
Take your time.

419
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,500
I don't hard sell.

420
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,900
My product speaks
for itself.

421
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,500
Outside, I took something.

422
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,500
It's a prescription
drug called <i>Varatril,</i>

423
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,400
and I was
wondering if you...

424
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,100
<i>This ain't no farmacia.</i>

425
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,300
But what I got
right here...

426
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,200
it's better than
anything your doctor

427
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,700
gave you back
in the States.

428
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,600
That's tar.

429
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,200
<i>Just take a taste,
algo pequenito.</i>

430
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,700
You know, keep it in check.

431
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,200
I don't have any
money right now.

432
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,300
Then I don't have any drugs.

433
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,900
But there are a few
ways for a man

434
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,500
to make a few dollars in Sona thou...

435
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,700
servicing
the needs of others--

436
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,800
not something I'm into...

437
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,100
You think I'm a punk?!

438
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,100
I'm just helping you

439
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,500
get well, friend, just
helping you get well.

440
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,200
Señor Lechero?

441
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,600
Señor Lechero.

442
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,500
What do you want?

443
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,300
Look, I know you're a busy man,
but I wanted to tell ya,

444
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,500
I don't know exactly
what he's doing,

445
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,400
- but Michael Scofield's
taking you for a ride.
- No, cerdo,

446
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,600
I don't think so.

447
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,100
Listen, I heard him talking
about escape yesterday--

448
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,600
about breaking outta here.
- It's he's talking
about escape,

449
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
why are you here telling me and
you're not going with him, eh?

450
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,500
I would if he'd let me,
but he's already cut me out.

451
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,000
He says he's square,
but I know

452
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,600
the son of a bitch
is up to something.

453
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,400
So I figured,

454
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,900
if I ain't running,
I might as well tell you

455
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,600
and make my time in here
a little bit easier.

456
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,100
Every man fantasizes
about escaping from Sona.

457
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Yeah, but they aren't all
in no-man's-land with shovels.

458
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm gave him the shovels.
Get him out.

459
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,100
I gave him shovels too,
and guys to work with,
just like you.

460
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,700
I worked in the prison
he broke out of.

461
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,100
He said he was
doing me a favor--

462
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,500
fixing damage
from a fire he started.

463
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,100
And you know what I got?

464
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,400
Hog-tied and left in a pipe
under my own prison.

465
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,700
There's nothing he can do.

466
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The soldiers
are watching him.

467
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,700
That's what I thought,

468
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,400
until he tunneled out
of my guard's room.

469
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,900
He's buried something
in a junction box out there

470
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,500
and covered it with dirt--
I saw him.

471
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,600
Go see for yourself.

472
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,500
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

473
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,900
Trouble keeps finding you
here in Sona, doesn't it?

474
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,200
Let's take a walk, eh?

475
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,100
There are rumors about
that you are trying to trick me.

476
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,700
I'm just doing what I'm told.

477
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,600
Oh? Let's hope for your sake
that's true.

478
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,700
Hmm?!

479
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,800
But just to make sure,

480
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,300
Let's go on out
to no-man's-land

481
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,500
and see what you
buried in there.

482
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,100
Just wanna make sure my men
are doing a good job for the colonel.

483
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Get in there.

484
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,900
Get in there.

485
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,300
Open it.

486
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,600
Move the dirt.

487
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,100
Now!

488
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,300
It's duct tape.

489
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,600
To fix the frayed wires.

490
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,900
That's why the power
was so inconsistent.

491
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,500
I didn't want the tape
to come loose,

492
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,900
so I packed it
down with dirt.

493
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,100
(chuckles)
Beautiful.

494
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,600
Where are you going?

495
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,700
I got to turn the main
power switch back on.

496
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,300
I had to turn it off, so we could
work on the wire safely.

497
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,100
I'Il come with you.

498
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,000
It's just a switch.

499
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,400
I can handle it myself.

500
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,800
You can... but you won't.

501
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,000
Hey, water boy,
it's back here.

502
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,100
I don't need the chain,
just the cross.

503
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,300
It's the perfect size
and it's not real gold,

504
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,600
so it won't
conduct current.

505
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,700
Keep the
circuit open--

506
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,500
no power even when
the main switch

507
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
is turned on.

508
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,600
Tahe cross out...

509
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,000
Sona lights up again.

510
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,100
Lechero find out you messed
with his electric...

511
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
you're dead.

512
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,700
That's why he can't
ever find out.

513
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,600
Now, don't make
me come get you.

514
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,500
SAMMY:
Nobody back there
can help you.

515
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,800
Uh, it's...

516
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,700
It's some kind of mistake.

517
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
It should be working.

518
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,000
The only mistake I made
was trusting you.

519
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,000
Sammy.

520
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,000
Transformer delay.

521
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,400
It's an old prison.

522
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,300
Now, if you
don't mind...

523
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,300
I'd like to move
into my new cell.

524
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,500
Thank you for your
words before, blanco.

525
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,600
Working for Lechero,

526
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,700
not an easy field
to plow, comprende?

527
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, I comprend.

528
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,800
You and me, we're

529
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
amigos, Nieves.

530
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,000
When Lechero is in
a better mood,

531
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm going to put in
a good word, help you,

532
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,300
How you say,
"Move up the ladder"

533
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,100
I appreciate

534
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,200
<i>it, compadre,  but I</i>

535
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,300
was always taught

536
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,000
that God helps those
that help themselves.

537
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,800
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

538
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,100
LINCOLN:
$15,000...

539
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,100
- Why?
- Because that's what he wanted.

540
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,900
Relax. I'll get you
the money.

541
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,300
- And I will meet you there.
- Okay.

542
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,300
How are you holding up?

543
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,500
I just want to get this done.

544
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,200
Good.

545
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,500
Stay here.

546
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,100
SOFIA:
- I'm coming with you.
- Stay here.

547
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,200
- You expect me to stay
here and wait?
- I don't care what you do.

548
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,000
- You don't care?
Who the hell are you
to say you don't care?

549
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,100
You're not the only one
affected by this.

550
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,700
Yeah, I know;
that's the problem.

551
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,900
But you will still just run off
and do whatever you want?

552
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,100
What kind of a man are
you that just...

553
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,800
They killed Sara
and put her head in a box!

554
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,100
And they've got my son!

555
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,400
Oh, Linc, I'm.... I'm sorry.

556
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,400
You still here?

557
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,200
Hey, Lechero wants
to talk to you.

558
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,800
I was just about to get
a little trim.

559
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Lechero said I was looking
all bhuttu!

560
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,700
It'll wait.
(T-Bag stammering)

561
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,199
Did you know
about this?

562
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,000
(Panting): No.

563
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,100
Did you know
anything about this?!

564
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,000
Me? No! No! Nieves...

565
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,600
Nieves--
we was friends, man.

566
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,400
That's right!

567
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,800
If you knew he was using
and didn't tell me...

568
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,200
his death is on your head.

569
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,600
Patrón, patrón, patrón...

570
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,500
I don't know nothing
about drugs.

571
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,800
I don't. I don't.

572
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
I mean, hell, I...

573
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,700
I tried me some reefer
when I was 12,

574
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,000
I almost coughed up a lung.

575
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,800
Good.

576
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,200
That's good.

577
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,100
Teodoro.

578
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,500
There appears to be
an opening on my crew.

579
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,900
McGrady, here's
your cross back.

580
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,800
And, uh... Thank you.

581
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,000
You're a real smart guy.

582
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,500
What the hell are
you doing in prison?

583
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,100
Here.

584
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,700
It's perfect.

585
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,400
How did you get it?

586
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
It's what
you wanted, right?

587
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,900
Yeah.

588
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,700
Good work.

589
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,100
So what's the next step?

590
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
Uh... we wait.

591
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,800
And, I'll keep you posted.

592
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,200
<i>You know what
you need to do.</i>

593
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,000
MICHAEL:
What do you think?

594
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,700
think you fixed
electricity for a reason

595
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,000
but it can't have been
to make that fence sizzle

596
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,400
like the third bloody rail.

597
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,900
Unless you want
to make the colonel happy.

598
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Actually, it's in both
of our best interests

599
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,000
to make that fence
as deadly as possible.

600
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,300
Now all we have

601
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,500
to do is wait for my
brother to come through

602
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,400
with the grave digger.

603
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,200
He wants more.

604
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,500
You said $15,000.

605
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,400
You said $15,000!

606
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,800
You said $15,000!
You said $15,000!

607
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,500
No, no, no!

608
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,200
What the hell
are you doing?!

609
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,100
- We need him!
- He will sell us

610
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,800
out to the cops
after he takes

611
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,200
as much as he
can from us.

612
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,700
LINCOLN/GRAVE DIGGER:
No!

613
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,200
<i>He's packing up to go.</i>

614
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,600
<i>Kill him.</i>

615
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,500
<i>He's going to betray you.
Kill him.</i>

616
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,000
T-BAG:
Good news, Agent Mahone!

617
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,900
Due to the untimely

618
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,400
demise of Señor Juan Nieves,

619
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,600
I have now been promoted Manager
in charge of Retail distribution

620
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,100
and Customer liaison.

621
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,500
Get away from me.

622
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
All in due time.

623
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,600
Now, I'm not your momma,

624
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,100
and I ain't one
to wipe other's noses,

625
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,500
but let's just say
you've looked better.

626
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,600
I want nothing
from you.

627
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,000
But sure seems
you need something.

628
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,900
On the arm.

629
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,100
No strings attached.

630
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,100
<i>Get your head
straight, Alex.</i>

631
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,300
SAMMY:
Come on in, man.

632
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,800
Come watch
the match. Come.

633
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,800
Oh, yeah. You guys call this
football down here, right?

634
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,400
Very good, very good.

635
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,600
It's World Cup-- football
without the silly hats

636
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,800
you wear in America,

637
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,100
where they all jump
on top each other

638
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,800
like a bunch of batty boys.

639
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,600
(laughs)
Have a seat.

640
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,500
Come.

641
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,700
Teodoro.

642
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,200
<i>Café </i>

643
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,600
The only thing
I hate more than a rat

644
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
is a rat with
bad information.

645
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,300
Yeah, look, I'm sorry
about all that,

646
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,400
but my information was good.

647
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,200
It's just that Scofield
is a tricky bastard.

648
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,300
He'll try something again.
You'll see.

649
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,800
Wait! Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

650
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,500
Come on, you guys.
What are you doing to me?

651
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,300
Come on! I gave you
good information!

652
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,100
Scofield's planning to escape!
I'm telling you!

653
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,100
He's a smart bastard!

654
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,700
Come on, you guys. Come on.
What are you doing?

655
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,600
No. No.

656
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,800
SAMMY:
Shh. Shh. Shh...

657
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,900
No! No.

658
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,600
Look, I gave you
good information.

659
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,800
Oh!

660
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,600
You said something
this morning about,

661
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
<i>"If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'."</i>

662
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,900
Just be thankful
I don't hold you to that.

663
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,200
Come on,

664
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,600
Agwe....

665
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,200
Help me here, man!
Come on.

666
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,200
Bagwell!

667
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,800
You left this in your old cell.

668
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Thanks, Alex.

669
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,200
You're welcome.

670
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,700
It's funny that you
could forget something

671
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,600
as important as this is.

672
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,100
Well, I'm glad
you found it for me.

673
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,400
Yeah.

674
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
Oh. Oh, look.

675
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,600
You are breathing only
by my grace, Michael.

676
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,300
Now, you remember
the next time that

677
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,100
you're going to send me
on a goose chase.

678
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,200
- Okay?
- I didn't.

679
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,000
No, no. You did.

680
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,300
And you think
you can manipulate me,

681
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:15,100
just like you did to Sucre...
and Tweener

682
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,500
and Haywire.

683
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm not your errand boy.

684
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,400
I'm going to go with you
when you escape,

685
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,100
and if you think,
in any way...

686
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,700
that you'll leave me,

687
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,500
I will put this piece
of metal right in that

688
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
very small space

689
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,700
right between your eyes.
I will.

690
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,100
How's LJ? How's Sara?

691
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
They told me they're fine.

692
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,600
Listen, uh,
the grave digger

693
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,300
is gone.

694
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,100
What do you mean,
he's gone?

695
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,000
Linc, we can't
do this without him.

696
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,300
We know, we know, that's
why we went to his supervisor--

697
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,700
the guy who approves
any hires for that job.

698
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,700
Turns out he could
use some cash.

699
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,700
<i>Oye, man.
Mail call.</i>

700
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,400
"You're running out of time"

701
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,800
This is how we're
getting out?

702
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,000
Yes.

703
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,000
With a little help
from an old friend.

704
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,800
What is that?

705
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,600
"Kesslivol."

706
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,000
It's a chemical
that kills the odors

707
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,800
caused by
decomposing bodies.

708
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,800
And, when heated to
a certain degree...

709
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,100
...it eats through steel.
