00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,070
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,760
Sona's a one-way street.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,770
What goes in

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,340
never comes out.
5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,830
Since the riots of last year they left here us to rot.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,330
They figured we would just destourselves,

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,430
but instead we've thrived.

8
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,390
How about we work together,you know,help each other out?

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,290
You're on your own.

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,480
Get me out of this! Yowant tYoknow

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,640
where she is,find a way

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,960
to get me out of this!

13
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,590
Maricruz... Maricruz.
We can assist you should you ever decide,

14
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,250
say,to break out of here.

15
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,700
This conversation's over.

16
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,210
We're trying to dohis the easy way

17
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,570
Think you can do me a favor?

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,070
We have a lot to discuss,Lincoln.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,590
Specifically,your brother.

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,330
How are we coming with the transfer?

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,950
You got to stay. What are you talking about?

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,390
Dad,I'm so sorry.

23
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,010
They got me and Sara.

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,700
You got a week to find this Whistler guy.

25
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,930
Otherwise,they,uh,both die.

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,970
Where you from up there,bro?

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,140
Chicago.

28
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,980
Michael Jordan.

29
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,250
Yeah.

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,160
You meet him?

31
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,790
It's a big city.

32
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,020
Oh,yeah,big city.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,840
Thanks for saving me a spot.

34
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,160
Hey!

35
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,330
Ejected!

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,110
You ever have sex with blond cheerleader?

37
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,860
Yeah,sure.

38
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,720
You're the man,bro.

39
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,510
How long's the water been out?

40
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,300
Since riots last year.

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Government blame us.

42
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,270
They say,"Screw you,you break it."

43
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,900
No water.

44
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,230
Gracias.

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,200
Real quick.

46
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,600
There's an inmate here named James Whistler.

47
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,430
I'm looking for him.

48
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,380
Welcome to club.

49
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,860
Everybody looking for him.

50
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,660
Why's that?

51
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,890
He killed the mayor of Panama City's son.

52
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,870
In bar fight.

53
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,640
Mayor not happy.

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,980
Hey,hey.

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,130
So where is he now?

56
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,260
Disappear.

57
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,860
Some say he might even escape.

58
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,170
Hey. Hey!

59
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,080
"I don't have no money.

60
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,200
I don't have no money," that's all I hear from you,

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,980
you know that?

62
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,310
But then I see you with this,huh?

63
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,070
Life must be good,eh?

64
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,300
Look,I'm-I'm hungry,okay?

65
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,060
You worry about me being hungry.

66
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,400
Hey,hey,hey,hey,come on.

67
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,970
Come on!

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,920
But you eat all the time.

69
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,770
Okay,I can see you up there.

70
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,900
Hequilo!

71
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,930
There's gonna be more water.

72
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:34,920
When?!

73
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,850
I said there will be more water.

74
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,170
Later,bro.

75
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,630
Go.

76
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,100
Spare a little?

77
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,660
I need some information.

78
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,710
Absolutely.

79
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,240
You slipped this note in my pocket yesterday.

80
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,060
Why?

81
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,320
My memory's a little foggy on account of this thirst.

82
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,620
Yeah,it's starting to come back to me now.

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,650
A little more agua there.

84
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,470
The note.

85
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,800
This guy gave me some rat meat in exchange for putting that

86
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,550
in your pocket and the pocket of the guy you were set to fight.

87
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,380
Why?

88
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,310
He's nuts,that's why.

89
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,680
Anybody who can live down in those sewers

90
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,900
doesn't have all his faculties.

91
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,930
Where in the sewers?

92
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,270
Whistler!

93
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,610
Whistler.

94
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,040
My name is Michael Scofield.

95
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,390
I was sent to get you out of here.

96
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,160
I'm going to assume they told you I was coming.

97
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,970
Or that someone was coming.

98
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,820
Whistler.

99
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,600
Last chance.

100
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,030
I'm not coming down here again.

101
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,590
You're here to get me out of Sona.

102
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,600
Are you surprised?

103
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,200
It's just that it's gonna be a bit difficult

104
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,440
getting me out of this hole.

105
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,000
Seeing as if I go above ground

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,900
and another inmate spots me,

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,390
I'm a dead man.

108
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,460
-TThere's a,there's a slight misunderstanding

109
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,090
that I have with the mayor...

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,270
You know what? It's none of my business.

111
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,150
I'll come back and get you when the time is right.

112
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,350
I may not make it that long.

113
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,820
That's your problem,my friend.

114
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,750
I've got problems of my own.

115
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,890
So you work for these people?

116
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,080
The ones that want me out of Sona.

117
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,450
Lookjust stay put.

118
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,230
As loI'll be back.knows you're here,y Why do they want me

119
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,030
out of here so badlyso can you at least tell me that?

120
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,510
Is this the part where you etend re innocent?

121
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,100
Just a pawn in all this?

122
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,930
If they told you anything about me before you came here,

123
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,820
you'd know that to be true.

124
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,640
I just want to know what they want with me.

125
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,230
Stay put.

126
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,460
In an effort to save some time,I'm gonna have

127
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,440
to insist that we just

128
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,480
skip right past all the threats I know

129
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
you're prepared to layout.

130
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,600
Should anything happen to Sara to LJ,

131
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,400
you will scour the Earth and hunte down

132
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,650
and rip my heart from my chest

133
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,610
and bup,bup,bup.

134
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,900
I absolutely know how you feel,

135
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,330
as would I,okay?

136
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,870
So that's done.

137
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,890
On to business.

138
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,170
Did you brother get the message?

139
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,920
Good. You and I will meet here every day.

140
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll want a full report of the prior day's progress.

141
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,330
When I call your cell phone,answer.

142
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,480
Don't ask me stupid questions.

143
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,590
Don't waste my time.

144
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,160
Get a plan together.

145
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,450
Execute it.

146
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,900
LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler.

147
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,110
Are we clear?

148
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,230
I want a picture of my son and Sara to prove they're alive.

149
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,750
OX Fine. I can do that,next.

150
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,110
Why us?

151
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,330
I'll answer that question

152
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,520
so we can put it to bed and you can focus on your work.

153
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,240
There's a political spotlight on Whistler

154
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,110
due to the nature of his crime.

155
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,920
Ras,bribes,what have you,

156
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,370
are not an option.

157
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,960
We have to go in through  door,so to speak.

158
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,270
This can't be done in a week.

159
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,420
You have a week. That's it.

160
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,510
Are we clear?

161
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:38,820
What's your name?

162
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,770
Susan B. Anthony.

163
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm assuming you weren't

164
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,480
born by immaculate conception.

165
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,520
You're right,Lincoln.

166
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,330
Family trees being what they are,

167
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,460
moms,dads,brothers,sisters.

168
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,590
Anything happens to my son or Sara,

169
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,460
I'm not coming after you,Susan.

170
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,590
Get to work.

171
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,110
His man knocks over the water!

172
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,850
Now,didn't you see how Lechero just walked away?!

173
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,330
He doesn't care about us!

174
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,520
He doesn't give a damn!

175
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,530
Living like a king up there!

176
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,610
(speaking gibberish)

177
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,940
Come out,what are you,afraid?!

178
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,280
Come on!

179
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,510
Lechero,come out!

180
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,100
Por favor.

181
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,060
Por favor. Vete.

182
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,110
Vete,perro.

183
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,580
Why you so interested about that guy down there?

184
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,340
No reason.

185
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,740
Then why you whispering,college boy?

186
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,750
Why don't you lower your voice already?

187
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,500
What's in it for me? I'm sorry.

188
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,550
Do you have any other friends in here besides me?

189
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm it.

190
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,330
Friends don't t friends go hungry and thirsty All right.

191
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,030
All right. and damn near half-naked.

192
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,110
I said "all right;" I'll take care of it! When?

193
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,550
When I can.

194
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,450
What's the big deal?

195
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,640
Why's he hiding?

196
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,800
Who's he hiding from?

197
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,650
Mayor get message to Lechero

198
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,170
saying if Whistler guy gets killed here in Sona,

199
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,830
whoever kills him gets to go to court,

200
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,780
gets to see a judge.

201
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,090
Judge friendly with mayor.

202
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,210
Kill him,and-and

203
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,510
then you get to get out of here and be free?

204
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,420
That's what Lechero say.

205
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,800
This'll stay between me and you.

206
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,400
If your friend wanted you to know,why didn't he tell you?

207
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,870
'Cause... 'cause you and I are friends now.

208
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,470
Unless you want to be enemies.

209
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,080
Fries.

210
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,910
Good. Me,too.

211
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,270
Sucre?

212
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,630
Sucre,get me out of here,please.

213
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,820
Where's Maricruz?

214
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,610
Yeah.

215
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,820
Yeah,Maricruz-- she's good,she's okay,

216
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,300
but-but I'm not telling you anything

217
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,710
until you get me out of here.

218
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,940
Tell me where she is right now!

219
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,490
You shoot me,you'll end up inside this hellhole.

220
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,210
WA I'm done.

221
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,330
I don't care anymore.

222
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,730
I can only guess she's dead by now,

223
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,670
so you're dying with her. (gun cocks)

224
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:23,850
I never had her!

225
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,250
At that house in Mexico,

226
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,790
I chased your aunt and Maricruz off.

227
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,820
I told them I'd lock 'em up

228
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,130
for accessory if they didn't hightail it.

229
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,520
I swear to God.

230
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,470
And the crucifix?

231
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,220
I ripped it off

232
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,350
Maricruz before she ran.

233
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,950
There was no phone in that dump,so I knew you wouldn't

234
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,160
be able to call from t road to...

235
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,290
to make sure I wasn't lying.

236
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,070
I-I conned you.

237
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,720
So...

238
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,170
She's picking grapes.

239
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,290
I have no idea.

240
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,950
Now,just lower the barrel.

241
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,810
Put the gun down.

242
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,190
Now,I came clean with you and helped you out,

243
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:06,970
right,buddy?

244
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,340
Soou got to return the favor.

245
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,010
Call my mom in Joliet-- Edna Bellick.

246
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,470
She's listed. Sucre?

247
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,420
I never la a hand on Maricruz.

248
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,140
I would never do that!

249
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,010
Sucre,help me,please!

250
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,270
Sucre,help me!

251
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,370
Help me!

252
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,400
Hey.

253
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:35,920
Hey.

254
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,330
You find Whistler?

255
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,230
Yeah.

256
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,390
What's his story?

257
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,420
I don't know,and maybe

258
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,670
it's better that way,huh?

259
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,040
I just got

260
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,300
to get him out of here,right?

261
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,360
Come on,man,come on.

262
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,920
We got to keep moving,we got to keep moving.

263
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,900
What's the next play?

264
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,910
Whistler got a note out

265
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,290
on a dead body yesterday.

266
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,990
I don't know what it means or who it's for.

267
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,360
But we need all the leverage we can get,

268
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,540
and,uh...

269
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,740
I need some money.

270
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,800

276
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,540
I'm going to break this guy out of here,

277
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,200
or I'm going to die trying.

278
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,340
And if it's the latter,

279
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,630
then that should count for something,rightg,

280
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,030
That's got to count for something.

281
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,380
You tell them that.

282
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,760
I will.

283
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,850
Tell them.

284
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,450
I'd trade places with you in a second.

285
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,010
I know.

286
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,360
Whistler?

287
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,100
You're not safe here.

288
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,540
I can take you someplace that is.

289
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,980
 Fhmhm
Sucre?

290
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,410
Linc!

291
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,350
What are you doing here?

292
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,000
What are you doing here?

293
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,000
Michael's locked up.

294
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,810
For what?

295
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,460
I don't know.
I'm sorting it through.

296
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,650
(sighs)
I could use
your help.

297
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,330
We're in a... we're
in a bad spot.

298
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,650
UhI feel for you, man, b I

300
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,170
Hey, youe still wanted

301
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,010
I'll figure meing out.

302
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,060
All right.

303
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,750
If you changyour
mind, I'm staying at
the Plaza del Sol.

304
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,200
I won't. I'm-I'm out
of here, bro.

305
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,110
I'm going to go see my girl.

306
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,030
Listen to me. The innocent
people in your life--

307
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,970
you got to keep them innocent--
if that means walking away

308
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,520
from them, that's what
you got to do.

309
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,850
Good luck, Linc.

310

Have we had our laughs
with him yet?

313
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,850
(Wyatt shouting in distance)
He's useless, man.

314
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,400
You want to get rid of him?

315
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,970
Huh? Then you cut
the mango. Huh?

316
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,000
You caused me

317
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,370
a big, big problem
out there today!

318
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,500
You understand that?

319
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,220
Now there's
no more water.

320
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,170
They'll live.

321

(distant shouting)
Oh, yeah?

322
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,060
They'll live?

323
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,580
Yeah? Well,
you tell them that, then.

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,530

338
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,850

340
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,280
Lecher come t.

341
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,430
The Ameran in hisunderwea-

342
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,800
T-Bag.

343
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,050
Boy, you're going
to be drinking your own urine

344
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,140
before you get any of this.

345
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,830
I just need to speak
to Seor Lechero, please?

346
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,930
Why don't you do yourself
a favor-- scamper.

347
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,950
But I got something.
Oh, yeah.

348
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,560
You got yourself
the untouchable status.

349
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,370
Get myself killed just talking
to your mangy ass.

350
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,130
 <i>Andale.</i>

351
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,970
But I got information.

352
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,830
Good information.

353
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,390
Are you out of
your mind, huh?

354
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,380
Hey! Hey! Hey!
He's got info.

355
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,840
Pick a... pick a kneecap, huh?

356
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,370
BELLICK:
I got information!
I just want food and clothing.

357
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,210
Patron, please.

358
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,560
Hold on. Hold on!

359
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,330
This better be
informative.

360
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,700
Or it's your kneecap next.

361
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,710
This morning, before that whole,
uh, water thing,

362
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,990
I, I heard you
and the lads talking

363
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,700
about that Whistler character,
how no one's found him.

364
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,670
Well...

365
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,760
I just want food and clothing...

366
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,120
Just tell him, idiot!

367
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,330
BELLICK:
There's a guy hiding

368
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,480
down in the sewers.

369
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,200
I-I figure he's hiding
from you, right,

370
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,630
because you run
this place, right?

371
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,300
And so I figured you'd want
to know everything

372
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,130
goes on here,
so...

373
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,690
Fine, shut up.

374
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,420
It just might be Whistler,
 <i>si, patron?</i>

375
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,710
 <i>Si?</i>

376
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,790
Is he Australian?

377
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,680
Yeah.

378
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,780
Yeah!

379
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,770
Courtesy of the Lechero's
munificence.

380
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,120
All right, now, y'all need
to back up a tad now.

381
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,250
Hey.

382
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,730
How long you been
in Sona?

383
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,140
McGRADY:
Three years.

384
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,930
How old are you?

385
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,560
Seventeen.

386
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,470
And as far as you know,

387
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,140
no one's ever broken out
of this place except,

388
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,260
uh... except maybe
this Whistler guy?

389
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,130
You Americans ask a
lot of questions.

390
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,810
(softly):
Oh, no.

391
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,390
What's wrong?

392
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,570
Come on.
Please.

393
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,240
Come on!
I have a family.

394
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,870
S-So do I.

395
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,070
Come on.

396
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,520
Stop!

397
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,250
Stop, okay?

398
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,790
Just...

399
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,560
he is come on with me

400
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,380
Just back up,
Michael. Just...

401
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,360
You don't actually think
that killing somebody

402
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,100
is going to help you getut
of here, do you?

403
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,750
That does seem pretty strange,
doesn't it?

404
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,300
But this is
a really strange place,

405
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,870
one I want to get out of.

406
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,190
Then I'll help you.

407
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,700
I'll testify for you,

408
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,370
whatever it takes.
Wow.

409
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,900
Wow, look at that halo

410
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,810
that just appeared
above your head.

411
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,070
It's amazing.

412
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,560
I don't have a choice, Alex...
What'd you tell me

413
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,430
yesterday?

414
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,950
What did you tell me
yesterday?

415
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,070
Huh? "You're on your own, Alex."

416
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,050
Back up. Back up!

417
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,950
You...

418
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,650
you don't want this.

419
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,950
Let me help you, Alex. A

420
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,750
WYATT:
Hey, your majesty!

421
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,810
You got
to shut him up.

422
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,810
I need this bolson
to call me back.

423
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,350
I need to talk
to you.

424
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,580
Don't ever
walk in here

425
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,130
thout being called!
I'm sorry.

426
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,310
But it's worth the breach
in etiquette.

427
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,380
Is it now?

428
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,170
I thought you could use my help.

429
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,040
There are ways I can be
of assistance.

430
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,430
不知道说什么  自己听

431
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,650
Whistler don't mean

432
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,860
nothing to me, man.

433
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,170
I have five consecutive life
sentences-- I ain't coming out

434
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,450
of Sona no time soon.

435
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,910
And why should I deprive
other men of chance at freedom?

436
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,350
Huh?
I need you to trust me.

437
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,770
Oh.

438
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,600
Trust you?

439
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,130
I don't know you good enough,
brother.

440
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,510
Teodoro.

441
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,560
 <i>Si, patron?</i>

442
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,810
Can I trust this bobo?

443
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,230
He's a snake.

444
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,240
He stabbed me

445
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,510
in the back every chance he got.

446
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,730
A whst a m t back.

447
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,230
ner hear
 such a creature before.

448
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,270
We got to op this!

449
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,270
Just give me two more minutes.

450
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,270
Leave now!

451
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,900
Leave!

452
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,480
WYATT:
Crumbs!

453
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,800
That's what you're giving us!

454
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,050
Your crumbs!

455
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,820
Hey, Lechero,

456
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,470
how's your
television?

457

(laughing):
How's your whore?ho

458
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,030
Come on,
what are you scared of?

459
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,190
Hey.

460

I need some, uh,
some moonshine.

461
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,020
Moonshine?
Or some alcol.

462
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:42,910
Booze.

463
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,750
Booze, yeah.

464
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,390
I need it now.
A liter or a gallon--

465
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,080
whatever you can get
your hands on.

466
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,470
It's not good time
for party, bro.

467
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,740
Bring it to me
in my cell.

No thank you .I'm good

Cause it looked like you needed something

00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,720
No

486
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,780
I'm just waiting for the bus

Come on, Whistler.

00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,000
Whistler, stop!

490
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,230
Stop!

491
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,330
What are you...

492
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,910
Whistler...

493
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,950
Just come up
top with me.

494

You got

495
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,330
a better chance coming up
with me.

496
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,450
At least you can plead your case
to Lechero.

497
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,560
Just get...

498

Go to hell.

00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,010
Just...

500
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,700
His best batch,

501
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,980
It's fine.

502
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,030
I'm going to need
some plastic bags.

503
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,750
You didn't get it for to party,
did you?

504
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,130
Plastic bags,
as many as you can get.

505
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,130
I'll make it worth your while,
I e.

506
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,140
This is it?

507
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,380
That's it

508
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,840
If you could just sign for it

509
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,970
 <i>Gracias.</i>

510

You know, uh,

515
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,420
you could lose the whole
grieving widow thing.

516
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,580
You're Whistler's
girl, right?

517
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,480
I'm sorry, I have
to be somewhere.

518
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,190
I've got, uh, I got to
do something, all right?

519
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,350
Do what?

520
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,990
Give me that back

521
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,260
or I'll call
the police.

522
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,060
You're not going to
call the police.

523
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,070
Why does he want this?

524
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:05,830
I don't know.

525
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,160
He's just a fisherman.

526
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,090
A fisherman?

527
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,280
Well, tell your fisherman
friend...

528
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,240
tell your fisherman friend
Scof 's brother just have this

529
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,740
Why won't you people just leave him
alone?!

530
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,990
You think we want to
be forced into this?

531
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,330
You think we want
to be here, lady?

532
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,310
Forced into what?

533
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,640
What are you talking about?

534
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,670
All right,
hold this.

535
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,640
Hold it.

536
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,190
Watch the hallway
for me.

537
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,740
I'm friends with
everybody here, bro.

538
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,590
That's how I keep alive.

539
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,600
You and I are friends, right?

540
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,190
Yeah, but looks like
you got enemies.

541
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:08,340
What I did for you,
getting you those
things...

542
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,640
No one will ever know.

543
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,250
ALL (chanting):
Lechero! Lechero!

Stand up.

Come on.

Back up! Back up.

549
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,190
You can have him,

550
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,380
but two of you will die
in the process.

551
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,920
You first? You first. I'll wrap
this right around your head.

552
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,520
Move. Move!

Enough!

557
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,010
Let me go down there.

558
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,790
Let me cut just one throat.

559
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,120
Just one.

560
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,930
They'll quiet down, man.

561
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,880
T-BAG:
And then regroup later

562
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,970
with a real reason

563
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,670
to come after you.
Shut your mouth.

564
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,700
LECHERO:
He's right,Sammy.

565
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,220
Lechero! Lechero!
Lechero!

566
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,850
So, what we going
to d

567
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,510
We just going
to sit up here,

568
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,460
hope they run
out of rocks?

569
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,340
Lechero!
Lechero!

570
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,430
LECHERO:
We have a
problem.

571
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,560
MAN:
What is it?

572
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,510
Ran out of water.

573
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,980
So, you mean
 <i>you've</i> got a problem.

574
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,870
Look, there was
an accident here.

575
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,350
The tank tip over.

576
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,870
My men need water, man.

577
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,040
I'll see if I can get the water
truck there day after tomorrow.

578
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,140
No, I need water <i>now!</i>

579
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,310
I guess it's too bad
there's no guards

580
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,620
in there anymore with you, huh?

581
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,640
You could

582
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,190
 hostages, have a riot,
make demands.

583
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,210
Day aftertomorrow.

584
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,760
Lechero...!

585
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,730
You call me and you raise
youroice at me like that

586
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,950
again, you're not going

587
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,880
to see water for two weeks.

588
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,760
Hmm? <i>Entendido?</i>

589
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,570
he got Whisler

590
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,970
LECHERO:
Enough!

591
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,420
Enough!

592
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,070
Now, I'll decide this!

593
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,700
You'll decide nothing.

594
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,400
You can't
deliver, Lechero.

595
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,530
You're done here.

596
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,160
 t
Now what?

597
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,600
What do we do?

598
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,750
You've been outbid.

599
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,390
Wait. What are
you talking about?

600
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,370
What are you ta...?

601
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,590
What are you
talking...?

602
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,180
That's, uh, very useful.

603
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,930
Very useful.

604
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,840
And Whistler's clear?

605
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,740
Yeah.

606
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,190
Clear as the blue sky, brother.

607
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,940
MARICRUZ:
Hello?

608
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,580
Baby, it's me.

609
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,310
Oh, my God.

610
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,790
Oh, I... I've been so scared,
I've been praying

611
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,860
every day.

612
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,330
I did, too, babe.

613
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,970
I just thank God you're okay.

614
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,230
Petey called me
after he had talked to you,

615
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,280
and he said that you might
)  coming back here?

616
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,420
That's what I told him.

617
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,990
Yeah.

618
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,870
You have to be so careful.

619
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,780
Baby,

620
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,320
I've been thinking, and, um,

621
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,710
the only thing that I...

622
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,240
about right now

623
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,230
is that isu
t and e ba are oy.

624
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,190
That's all that matters to me.

625
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,930
I'm not coming back.

626
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,800
It's not because
I don't love you, because

627
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,960
you know I do--

628
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,510
I love you more...
I love you more than anything,

629
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,830
but... all I do
is bring you down.

630
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,200
I'm no good for you.

631
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,850
That's not true,
that's not true.

632
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,740
Oh, it is, it is, it is, and...

633
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,140
sometimes the only way

634
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,940
to protect the people
that you love

635
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,450
is... is by staying away
from them.

636
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,610
One day when i get my life together

637
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,910
however long that takes--
I'll find you.

638
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,480
I'll find you, and, uh,

639
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,770
and I'll make you
and our baby proud.

640
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,240
 <i>Te lo prometo.</i>

641
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,890
 <i>Te lo prometo, mi amor.</i>

642
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,370
I wish we could go back.

643
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,160
I would give anything
to go back.

644
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,630
I wish that, too.

645
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,170
I wish that, too, baby.

646
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,490
I love you so much, baby.

647
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,440
I love you, too, baby.

648
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,780
Good-bye.

649
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,390
(quietly):
Bye.

650
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,510
You know, they told
me that your brother

651
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,890
got all the brains,

652
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,610
but I didn't realize
you were this stupid.

653
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,420
What do you want, Susan?

654
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,570
No sooner do I tell you
to stick to the plan,

655
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,110
than you go and hassle
Whistler's girlfriend.

656
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,950
You need to quit

657
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,150
playing Sherlock Holmes
and leave her alone.

658
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,240
Why?

659
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,870
'Cause I said so.

660
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,430
w about that?
All right.

661
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,960
How about you beat it,
so I can get to work?

662
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,330
I will

663
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,690
as soon as you give me
what you took from her.

664
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,530
I took nothing from her.
I got a gallon

665
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,970
of bleach, a tarp and a hacksaw
in the trunk of my car.

666
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,010
One hour, tops--

667
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,410
you're off the face
of the earth.

668
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,820
It's just a bird guide.

669
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,630
I am not going to ask you again.

670
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,680
Toss it.

671
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,590
Tomorrow-- bar.

672
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,820
Progress report.
I will be waiting.

673
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,410
Sot's water you want.

674
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,220
Here's your water.

675
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,710
Thank you.

676
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,510
So, how are we
getting out of here?

677
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,540
I have no idea.

678
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


679
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

680
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
