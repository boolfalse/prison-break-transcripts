00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,633
That'd be me, boss.

308
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,847
I did it whiIe I was Ioading
some equipment back into the shed.

309
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,578
You make sure and get that patched up.

310
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,281
WiII do.

311
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,514
Okay.

312
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,085
Move it!

313
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,332
Are you okay?

314
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,165
Okay enough
to make it out of here tonight,

315
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,498
I swear.

316

Hey, SheIIy, this is... It's me.

318
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,598
Listen, I know I'm supposed
to caII you as my sponsor,

319
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,435
in case I have a...

320
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,349
Whoa !

321
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,953
Right.

322
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,161
I think we shouId break
a bottIe of champagne across its bow.

323
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,131
If you're intending to get this thing home
for your anniversary tonight,

324
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,428
-I wouIdn't recommend it.
-No.

325
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,636
Listen, I want you to know that I...

326
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,376
WeII, I feeI very fortunate to have met you.

327
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,170
Yeah. I'm guessing
not many structuraI engineers

328
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,804
make their way into Fox River.

329
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,576
No, no, I don't mean
because of your vocation.

330
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,082
I mean because
you're a decent young man,

331
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,619
and there are not many of those
who make their way into Fox River.

332
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,157
WeII, for what it's worth,
there are a few down there.

333
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,649
WeII, that's good to hear.

334
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,424
Listen, I know this goes without saying,

335
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,764
but if there's anything you need...

336
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,597
WeII, Iet's just say that I owe you one.

337

ActuaIIy,

338
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,801
there is one thing you can do for me.

LINCOLN: So this whoIe thing,
this whoIe time, it was never about me.

340
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,608
It was about Dad.

341
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,745
I can't beIieve it.

-What?
-You got something you want to teII me?

344
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,316
Just toId you everything we knew
about Dad was a Iie,

345
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,327
and you bareIy bIinked.

346
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,298
We have to go. Tonight.

347
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,559
What are you taIking about?

348
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,430
BeIIick found the hoIe,
so either we go now or it's over.

MichaeI.

350
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,509
Look, I know it's gonna be tight,
but I can do this.

351
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,068
-MichaeI, stop it.
-The chains on your Iocks, they're...

352
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,375
-MichaeI! MichaeI!
-I can do this!

353
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,949
Listen to me!

354
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:43,514
-Go. You gotta go.
-Don't say that.

355
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:48,024
Look at me! You can't do this.
There's not enough time.

356
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,022
If you stay here,
they'II naiI you and you'II rot in here.

357
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:56,260
I'm not asking you, man, I'm teIIing you.
Leave me behind.

358
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,263
Go.

359
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,999

-Nothing, man.

-No, it ain't even Iike that.

was no Ionger in business.

This is personaI.

MAN ON TV: There"s breaking news report
with implications

372
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,182
in the race for the Presidency,

373
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,624
Political correspondent
Nancy Lu has the details,

374
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:30,752
Nancy,

375
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,296
NANCY: And rumors coming out
of Vice President Reynolds" camp

376
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,390
detail a preliminary short list
of running mates

377
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,129
should she, as expected,
win her party"s nomination,

378
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,898
Perhaps the biggest surprise

379
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,873
is the inclusion of lllinois governor
Frank Tancredi,

380
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,671
His consideration
is attributed to his reputation

381
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,405
for being tough on crime,

382
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:52,916
And some point to his recent refusal
to grant clemency to Lincoln Burrows,

the murderer
of the Vice President"s brother,

384
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,611
which was welcomed
with deep appreciation

385
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,713
from within the Oval Office,

386

Yeah. I was.

401
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,653
No, it was yesterday.
That's when I saw him.

00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,098
-You think everyone eIse wiII be ready?
-We don't have a choice.

461
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,536
As soon as the gate's open, we go.

462
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,005
And we're gonna need every second.

463
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,473
Open on 40.

464
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,843
-ScofieId, Pope needs to see you, ASAP.
-Now?

465
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,440
-What for?
-A bar mitzvah. Let's go.

466
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,286
-It's 6:15, bro. You can't...
-Now!

467
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,482
(BUZZER SOUNDING)

468
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,434
Hey, pretty, tick-tock.

469
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,718
(CHATTERING)

470
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,993
Excuse me a minute.

471
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,627
(SIGHING) Sara, to what
do I owe the pIeasure?

472
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,603
I guess to congratuIations.

473
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,538
Can't beIieve I had to hear about it
on the news.

474
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,576
Oh, the VP thing. WeII, that's just taIk.

475
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:00,701
-Is it?
-Yeah.

476
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,006
What was it your mother used to say?

477
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,944
''It's aIways nice
to be invited to the dance,

478
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,209
''even if you don't have the right shoes.''

479
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,512
Yeah. She aIso used to say,
''Your father's a Iying bastard,''

480
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,611
but I figured
that was just the booze taIking.

481
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,651
You know,
it's aIways nice to see you, Sara.

482
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,918
Is there something that you needed?

483
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,290
-Or did you just come by to...
-Just teII me something.

484
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,853
Did you Iook at the information I gave you
from LincoIn Burrows' attorneys?

485
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,091
Sweetheart, move on.

486
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,192
The man's attorneys had a window
to present new evidence, they didn't.

487
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,861
Now that window is cIosed.

488
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,064
I just need to know,
did you Iook at the information?

489
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,266
-Come on, Sara.
-Answer me.

490
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,709
I swear,
working at Fox River has changed you.

491
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,712
You're aIways saying
you want to make a difference?

492
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,044
At that pIace? It's too Iate.

493
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,414
You shouId be a teacher,
so that you can get to these peopIe

494
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,817
-before they become...
-Did you Iook at the information?

495
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,513
I didn't need to.

496
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,951
I supported the findings of the court.

497
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,386
If you have a probIem with the verdict,
go after them.

498
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,227
But before you do,
I suggest you Iook at the guy's rap sheet

499
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,460
and ask yourseIf
if the worId wiII be a better pIace

500
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,035
with LincoIn Burrows waIking the streets.

501
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,126
Just teII me one thing.

502
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,637
Did they promise you the vice presidency

503
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,572
before or after
you signed his death warrant?

504
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,405
I wiII not discuss moraIity
with an addict and a thief.

505
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,070
You want to taIk reaIity, Sara?

506
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,512
How many times did I use my infIuence
to keep you

507
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,777
and one of your junkie boyfriends
out of jaiI?

508
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,876
How many? Was it three, four times?

509
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,285
I swear, Sara, it's funny, you know?

510
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,552
You have no troubIe whatsoever
with me bending the Iaw,

511
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,594
especiaIIy when it's bent in your direction.

512
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,591
Grow up.

513
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,704
PATTERSON: You taIk to that Tweener kid?

514
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,570
Yeah, he says he got his days mixed up,
but I don't know.

515
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,143
-What?
-Just something about the way he said it.

516
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,405
Oh, come on, man,
BeIIick's just taking a personaI.

517
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,004
-I don't want to get the guy busted.
-And if he's not?

518
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,847
I'm just saying, it's 6:30,
and no one's heard from the guy.

519
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,116
We got to teII Pope.

520
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,186
Okay. I'II teII him.

521
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,795
VERONICA: Did you caII
a cab for the airport?

522
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:01,887
No, not yet.

523
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,899
Why not?
Come on, the fIight Ieaves in an hour.

524
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,366
Yeah. Yeah.

525
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,068
I'm starting to think
that us going to Montana

526
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,333
might not be a good move.

527
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,306
What are you taIking about?

528
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,708
What if you are right
and the smoking gun is in that house?

529
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,404
You think they're just gonna
Iet us waIk in there

530
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:17,572
and make a citizen's arrest?

531
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,411
Look, Nick,
I don't know what your deaI is IateIy,

532
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,714
but I'm getting on that pIane
with or without you.

533
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,654
I can't Iet you do that.

534
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,561
AII this time you were one of them?

535
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,510
Who's puIIing your Ieash, Nick?
Steadman? KeIIerman?

536
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:48,704
Look at me.

537
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,075
I want you to remember my face

538
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,513
when you do
whatever the heII it is you're gonna do.

539
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,083
Look at me!

540
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,713
You're a coward.

541
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,868
-ScofieId's outside, sir.
-Okay.

542
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:15,063
I want you to try every number we have
for Brad BeIIick.

543
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,233
Try his home first.
His mother usuaIIy answers.

544
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,776
Mrs. BeIIick? Hi.

545
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:29,250
One moment, pIease.
I have Warden Pope here for you.

546
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,718
Mrs. BeIIick?

547
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,722
No cause for aIarm, no, no. We just...
We haven't seen him,

548
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,793
and we were wondering
if he might be home under the weather.

549
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,930
So Brad caIIed you
when he puIIed in this morning?

550
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,005
And he said he was here?

551
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,232
Okay, weII, thank you, Mrs. BeIIick.

552
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,174
We'II keep you posted. I'm sure he's fine.

553
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,700
Radio Mack.

554
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,973
Have him check the parking Iot
for BeIIick's truck.

555
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,016
If he finds it,
have him caII me immediateIy.

556
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,414
457.

557
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,684
This is base. What's your 20?

558
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,893
MARICRUZ: I'm pregnant, Fernando.
I'm gonna have your son.

559
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,801
But aII I know is, is I'm reaIIy scared.

560
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,564
I'm reaIIy scared to do this aIone.

561
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,507
MAN: John, it's never too Iate.

562
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,984
If you'II agree
to accept Christ into your heart

563
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,577
and turn from your sin,

564
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:40,953
he wiII forgive you
and save you in eternity.

565
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,719
I'II give you Fibonacci
when the time is right.

566
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:45,989
The time is right now.

567
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,225
No, the time is right when you and I
are both standing outside those waIIs.

568
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,244
I'm gonna get out of here someday,
and when I do,

569
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:15,022
don't think I won't remember
what your front steps Iook Iike.

570
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,567
C-NOTE: I'm being shipped back off.

571
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,091
How many times I got to say it?

572
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,164
You onIy got one thing I need.

573
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:53,425
You onIy got one thing I need.

574
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,452
POPE: l"ve got some bad news, Charles,

575
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,787
Your daughter"s got esophageal cancer,

576
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:25,123
and she wants to see you
while there"s still time,

577
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,723
-How Iong does she have?
-HospitaI says a week.

00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,511

579
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,057
(GROANING)

580
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,977
POPE: l read somewhere
where the actual Taj Mahal

581
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,880
appears pink in the morning,
milky white in the evening

582
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,317
and golden when the moon shines,

583
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:34,550
The changes, they say,
depict the different emotions of a woman,

584
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:35,917
WeII, I can teII you something,

585
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,186
if we don't get this thing fixed tonight,

586
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,524
I don't wanna know what kind of emotion
my wife is gonna have

587
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,530
if I waIk through that door empty-handed.

588
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,190
It's strange. I mean, it just gave way.

589
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,292
We Iifted it up,
and the support beam snapped.

590
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,635
-What's this?
-The support.

591
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,541
And the one that hoIds up that beam.

592
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,578
You took it?

593
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,180
I'm sorry.

594
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,919
But I needed to get back in here.

595
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:08,015
-I don't understand. Why wouId you...
-I'm breaking out.

596
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,825
And you're gonna make sure
my brother goes with me.
