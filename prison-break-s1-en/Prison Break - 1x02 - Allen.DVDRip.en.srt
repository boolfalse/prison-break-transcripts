1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,074
previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,630
I find it incumbent that you
see the inside of a prison ceII.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,235
- (Sucre) Why do you want to see Burrows?
- Because he's my brother.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,039
So you get yourseIf
tossed into Fox River with him?

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,315
To what? Save him?

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,437
And whoever it was that set me up wants me
in the ground as quickIy as possibIe.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,559
The cIoser it gets, the more I'm worried that
the bottom wiII faII out of this whoIe thing.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,756
That son of a bitch fingered Abruzzi.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,434
- (Maggio) Someone found Fibonacci.
- Who was this someone?

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,713
- (man) Why'd you hire him?
- Keep your friends cIose,

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,392
and your enemies cIoser.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,155
- They come at me, I'm coming after you.
- I doubt it.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,919
I'm getting you out of here.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,275
- It's impossibIe.
- Not if you designed the pIace it isn't.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,796
- You've seen the bIueprints.
- Better than that.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,435
I've got 'em on me.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,150
You're anticipating every one of my moves
three moves in advance.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,913
You're a heII of a strategist, fish.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,754
You ever think about Boston?
Think you'II ever see it again?

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,789
I'm a 60-year-oId man with 60 years Ieft
on my ticket. What do you think?

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,158
- I'm thinking about going.
- WeII, there's going and there's going.

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,151
Which one do you mean?

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,435
The one you think I mean.

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,388
Three days inside and he's aIready
thinking about turning rabbit.

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,510
It'II pass. It aIways does. Got bigger things
to worry about at the moment.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,478
I've been in here Iong enough
to know it when I see it.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,074
The caIm before the storm.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,596
Whites and bIacks are going at each other
reaI soon here.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,831
Everybody chooses sides
and a Iot of guys bIeed.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,558
There a reason?

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,712
Same reason you don't put
cats and dogs in the same cage.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,995
They don't get aIong.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,680
(# Sucre sings in Spanish)

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,552
- Hm.
- What?

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,393
- ToiIet won't fIush.
- So?

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,392
- Means onIy one thing, fish.
- (guard) Shakedown!

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,635
You can't fIush your contraband.

38
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,190
- We got nothing to worry about.
- Says who?

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,312
Under the tabIe, conjo.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,793
- What the heII is this?
- It's insurance, white boy. Now dump it.

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,674
Open it.

42
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,395
So, tooIing up for the race riot, are we?

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,039
Hand it over.

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,754
Huh. Rughead and the BiIIy.

45
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,548
- Which side are you on, anyhow, fish?
- That wouId be neither, boss.

46
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,475
Maybe you're gonna go extracurricuIar
with it, then. Stick a CO, maybe.

47
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,758
- Is there a probIem here, deputy?
- Got a shank in here.

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,629
Is this yours?

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,990
You're not a good Iiar.

50
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,069
Come on, Sucre. You're going to the SHU.

51
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,238
- Move aIong.
- I'm not done shaking this ceII down yet.

52
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,834
I said move aIong.

53
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,669
In the oId man's back pocket, are you?
WeII, I got news for you, fish.

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,118
He may run this pIace during the day,
but I run it during the night.

55
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,151
(Lincoln) What the heII
were you thinking, MichaeI?

56
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,390
- How are we doing it?
- The infirmary.

57
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,710
(Lincoln) Infirmary.

58
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,234
It's the weakest Iink in the security chain.

59
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,232
If I get that PUGNAc,
I'II get aII the access I need.

60
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,757
- What the heII's a PUGNAc?
- It Iowers my insuIin IeveIs.

61
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,308
As Iong as the good doctor
thinks I'm diabetic,

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,233
- I'II have time there to do what I need to do.
- Which is?

63
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,278
A IittIe work. A IittIe prep for your arrivaI.

64
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,033
- That's the idea, anyway.
- The idea?

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,478
There's a IittIe hitch in getting the PUGNAc.
They don't exactIy stock it at the commissary.

66
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,032
- This thing's riding on a bunch of piIIs?
- Someone's working on it as we speak.

67
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,632
- Now's not the time to trust a bIack inmate.
- Our reIationship transcends race.

68
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,553
Nothing transcends race in here.

69
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,712
Good behaviour,
you're outta here in three years.

70
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,190
- Gonna be a whoIe Iot sooner then that.
- It can't be done.

71
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,510
No one's ever broken out of Fox River.

72
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,751
Every step's aIready been mapped out.
Every contingency.

73
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,868
You may have the bIueprints to this pIace but
there's one thing those pIans can't show you.

74
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,432
Guys Iike Abruzzi. You so much as Iook at
these guys the wrong way, they'II cut you up.

75
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,548
As far as these guys are concerned, I'm just
a con doing his time, staying out of troubIe.

76
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,111
- You don't gotta Iook for troubIe. It finds you.
- And when it does, we'II be Iong gone.

77
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,668
This is madness. You can't get outta your ceII.

78
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,069
- Not true.
- What, you got a key?

79
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,594
(Michael) Something Iike that.

80
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,148
# For the brothers at my side

81
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,629
# l'd be willing to die

82
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,756
# Getting high all the time

83
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,638
# l'd be willing to die

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,790
# We keep riding the streets

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,599
# Me and my posse in crime

86
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,035
# For what's left of my life

87
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,714
# l'd be willing to die

88
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,997
(man) Wrong piece of reaI estate, fish.
BeIongs to T-Bag.

89
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,911
(Michael) Who?

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,312
Speak with respect, fish. Man kidnapped
haIf a dozen boys and girIs down in 'Bama.

91
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,756
Raped and kiIIed 'em.
Wasn't aIways in that order either.

92
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,515
- Does T-Bag have a reaI name?
- (man #2) That is my reaI name.

93
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,872
No, no, no. PIease, sit.

94
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,557
So, you're the new one I've been hearing
aII the rave reviews about.

95
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,392
ScofieId.

96
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,756
One thing's for sure.
You're just as pretty as advertised.

97
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,512
Prettier, even.

98
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,635
- Rugheads got you scared, do they?
- Sorry?

99
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,635
I assume that's why you're over here. A few
days on the inside, any white man reaIises

100
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,111
the correctionaI system's got a Iean
toward the African-American persuasion.

101
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,954
- I hadn't noticed.
- They got the numbers, aII right.

102
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,430
We got one thing they don't. Surprise.

103
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,633
We gonna take the baII game
to them reaI soon.

104
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,236
It's gonna be nasty for a first-timer Iike you.
We'II protect you. I'II protect you.

105
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,269
AII you gotta do is...
take this pocket right here

106
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,239
and your Iife'II be aII peaches and cream.
I waIk, you waIk with me.

107
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,517
I'II keep you reaI cIose
so no one up in here can hurt you.

108
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,195
Looks to me you aIready got a girIfriend.

109
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,953
I got a whoIe 'nother pocket over here.

110
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,679
I'II pass.

111
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,918
I don't protect you, them rugheads
are gonna gobbIe you up Iike a pIate of peas.

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,798
- I said no.
- Then you'd best move, then.

113
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,075
Now.

114
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,637
You come around these bIeachers again, it's
gonna be more than words we're exchanging.

115
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,553
Know what I'm saying?

116
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,679
(Veronica) Are you the Tim GiIes
that represented LincoIn Burrows?

117
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,753
- If you're a reporter...
- I'm not a reporter. I know the defendant.

118
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,469
- Oh. You famiIy?
- Not exactIy.

119
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,835
We were in a reIationship a few years back.

120
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,230
Ma'am, I... I don't know what to teII you.
The man was guiIty.

121
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,916
- The prosecution's case was a sIam dunk.
- The victim was the vice president's brother.

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,993
If you're suggesting the government
rammed this through, I take offence.

123
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,436
- I fought for that guy.
- That's not what I meant.

124
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,308
The evidence was there.
LincoIn worked for Steadman's company.

125
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,996
He gets into a pubIic aItercation with the guy,
so he gets fired. Steadman's shot dead.

126
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,470
The weapon's found in LincoIn's house,
the bIood on his cIothes.

127
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,475
Trust me. There are cases you Iose sIeep over
but this isn't one of 'em.

128
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,631
What about Crab Simmons?
LincoIn said he couId exonerate him.

129
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,395
The man's a five-time feIon, aII right?
He had no credibiIity.

130
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,472
- So you wouIdn't mind if I paid him a visit?
- Be my guest.

131
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,677
But I don't think it'II do you any good.

132
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,548
Strange feeIing. Don't know how to expIain it.

133
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,593
You know, um, usuaIIy my whoIe Iife
it's aIways been crazy and noisy.

134
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,313
Maddening, you know, in my head.

135
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,231
But now it's quiet.

136
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,230
It's perfect.

137
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,788
I'm gIad you came back.

138
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,396
I thought about you the whoIe time.

139
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,278
You know, I made a Iot of mistakes in my Iife.

140
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,555
I know that.

141
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,110
- I'm gonna make it right.
- I know you wiII.

142
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,074
- What are you doing?
- I want to remember this.

143
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,152
- No.
- Oh, come on. Come on, Vi, pIease. Just one.

144
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,355
OK.

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,991
- Easy.
- How are we doing on the PUGNAc?

146
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,108
- Hey, I'm working on it.
- WeII, work faster. I need that stuff tonight.

147
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,476
What's up there in that infirmary
that you need so bad?

148
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,348
You get me that PUGNAc
and maybe I'II teII you.

149
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,514
(T-Bag) Uh-uh-uh.

150
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,148
Thought we had an understanding.
This here's for the famiIy.

151
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,110
You made it pretty cIear you ain't bIood.
How about you hand that over?

152
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,957
Nice-Iookin' piece of steeI. Bit of work.
You couId do some serious damage with it.

153
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,350
Question is,
who is it you was pIanning on damaging?

154
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,431
I seen you with the Negroes, you know.

155
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,308
WeII, maybe you're one of them
miIk chickens, aII confused, Iike.

156
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,358
White on the outside,
bIack as tar on the inside.

157
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,477
Maybe we oughta take a Iook at them insides
and find out.

158
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,155
GirI Scouts, is there a probIem over there?

159
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,679
(T-Bag) I think we'II just hang onto this
if that's OK with you.

160
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,878
Hey! I'm not gonna ask you again.
Let's break up the party, Iadies.

161
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,555
You heard the man, IittIe doggie.

162
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,271
Get aIong.

163
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,592
What's it take to shake down another inmate?
Get something he's taken from you?

164
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,195
- It wouId take Fibonacci.
- WeII, I'II give you Fibonacci.

165
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,111
I promise you that.

166
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,192
- When the time is right.
- (Abruzzi) The time is right now.

167
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,317
No, when you and I are both standing
outside those waIIs.

168
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,313
You're on Iife without paroIe.
You'II never stand outside those waIIs.

169
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,393
Not unIess you knew someone,
someone who knew a way out.

170
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,600
- What do you say, John?
- I say I've heard nothing but bIabber.

171
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,317
PhiIIy FaIzone.

172
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,957
It's an honour. What are you doing here?

173
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,679
WeII, I, uh, just thought we'd,
you know, fraternise.

174
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,797
- He Iooks Iike it, doesn't he?
- Looks what?

175
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,352
Like everybody's been saying.
You got no sack. You've been neutered.

176
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,590
You shouIdn't taIk to me Iike that.

177
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,319
- You used to pick up my Iaundry.
- Not any more.

178
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,599
Word is someone knows where Fibonacci is
and you're not doing anything about it.

179
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,558
- I'm working on it.
- Not fast enough.

180
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,791
ApparentIy Fibonacci's
coming up for air again.

181
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,997
Next month, a congressionaI hearing.

182
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,712
Now, if he testifies at that hearing
a Iot of peopIe are going down, incIuding me.

183
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,756
Now, I've known you a Iong time.

184
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,391
Our wives are friends.
Our kids go to the same CathoIic schooI.

185
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,350
It wouId be a shame if anything happened to
your kids. I know my kids wouId miss them.

186
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,477
- You don't need to do this.
- I do.

187
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,950
I'II get this guy. We'II get Fibonacci.

188
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,436
- For everyone's sake, I hope you're right.
- I am.

189
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,556
Be weII, John.

190
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,758
Thank you.

191
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,913
Yo, badge, I gotta use the phone.

192
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,155
(hatch opens)

193
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,439
- Sure. You want a pizza and a pedicure too?
- I gotta caII my girI. She's expecting my caII.

194
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,436
- Put a sock in it. You got nothing coming.
- No, no, no, man! No, man!

195
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,669
Hey, puII up the manifest.

196
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,159
Is there an AIIen Schweitzer in gen pop?

197
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,833
- No.
- How about the SHU?

198
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,876
No. Why you asking?

199
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,951
Curious, that's aII.

200
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,471
# This is war
Better watch your back, sucker

201
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,028
# lt's the end of the world as you know it

202
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,237
# This is war
lt's gonna be a bad mother

203
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,959
# lt's time again
Boy, we gonna show you

204
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,271
# This is war
Better watch your back, sucker

205
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,828
# lt's the end of the world as you know it

206
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,276
# This is war
lt's gonna be a bad mother

207
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,749
# lt's time again
Boy, we gonna show you

208
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,718
- # This is war
- # This is war

209
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,998
- # This is war
- # Should've never let it come to this

210
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,917
You hear the trumpets, fish?
I know you can. That's Judgment Day.

211
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,389
It's coming. ReaI soon.

212
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,550
# And now you're wishing
that you just played your position

213
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,789
# This is war

214
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,156
(T-Bag) Yo, CurIy! Come on, May Tag.

215
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,670
(T-Bag) What you doing in my ceII?

216
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,869
I want in.

217
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,953
I'm not sure I heard that.
Did you say you're in?

218
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,272
- (Michael) That's right.
- In for an inch, in for a miIe.

219
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,353
You want me to fight, I'II fight.
The boIt from the bIeachers was for that.

220
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,958
WeII, you wanna fight,
you're gonna get your chance. Next count.

221
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,917
- Tonight?
- ProbIem with that?

222
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,916
We goin' straight at 'em. You better catch a
square, fish. We're undermanned in a big way.

223
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,152
- AII I need's a weapon.
- You want a weapon, bitch?

224
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,677
- There you go.
- (guard) AII prisoners, return to your ceIIs.

225
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,958
You have to prove yourseIf
before we trust you with the heavy artiIIery.

226
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,713
(guard) Gates cIosing!

227
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,192
(knock at door)

228
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,795
- I'm sorry for being so short with you before.
- No probIem.

229
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,236
CIoser it gets to an execution,
the harder it becomes.

230
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,754
That's why I wanted to give you this.

231
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,912
It's the surveiIIance tape
of the garage that night.

232
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,117
It was a cIosed triaI
so no one outside the courtroom saw it.

233
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,350
- It couId heIp you out.
- With what?

234
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,237
CIosure.

235
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,318
AIIen Schweitzer.
That name mean anything to you?

236
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,277
- ShouId it?
- I don't know. You teII me.

237
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,635
- Never heard of the guy.
- Are you sure?

238
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,711
Positive.

239
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,916
Ah, what's up, snowfIake?

240
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,798
Do you think I'm a fooI?

241
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,989
- What are you taIking about?
- I see you up there with the HitIer Youth.

242
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,469
I got a good mind
to sIash you open right now.

243
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,031
It's not what you think.
They've got something I need.

244
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,069
Now, see, that's funny,
because I got something you need too.

245
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,832
You want your PUGNAc, fish? Huh?

246
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,989
I hate 'em, baby. So wiII you.

247
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,199
Listen, white boy. Your Iuckjust ran out.

248
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,430
You chose the wrong side.

249
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,637
Man, it's great to see your face.

250
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,354
I think it's time you quit the charade,
don't you?

251
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,115
- What?
- It's starting to ruin peopIe's Iives.

252
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,679
MichaeI's in here
cos he thinks you're innocent.

253
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,799
- What's he toId you?
- He hasn't toId me anything, but I know.

254
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,235
I know what he's pIanning.

255
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,392
CaII him off. If you Iove him, caII him off.

256
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,673
- I saw the tape.
- That's not how it went down.

257
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,629
- I know what I saw.
- I know what I saw. I was there, remember?

258
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,159
l got high that night. l had to.
lt was the only way l could go through with it.

259
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,714
l never pulled the trigger.
The guy was already dead.

260
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,753
- I know. You toId me a thou...
- Listen! I was set up.

261
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,391
I went there to cIear a debt. Crab Simmons
was on my ass for the 90 grand I owed him.

262
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,950
ToId me the mark was some drug deaIer
and if I took it we'd be cIean.

263
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,158
I never puIIed the trigger. Somebody wanted
me in the same garage as Steadman.

264
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,993
Why wouId somebody wanna set you up?

265
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,595
It wasn't about me. It was about him.

266
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,193
- Steadman?
- Yes.

267
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,910
The guy was a saint. AII the charity work, the
environmentaI progress his company made.

268
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,551
About the onIy person in this entire country
who had motive to kiII him was you.

269
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,430
You came aII the way down here
to teII me how guiIty I am?

270
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,159
I don't know why I came here.

271
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,318
You have your Iife now. I know that.

272
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,270
But if what we had before meant anything
to you, you'd find out the truth.

273
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,435
Maybe aII this is the truth.

274
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,196
Maybe they got it right.

275
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,589
(shouting)

276
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,714
(mutters in Spanish)

277
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,634
- Badge! Badge, open up! Badge!
- You taIking again?

278
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,589
It's my girI's birthday. PIease. I'II give you
$1 miIIion if you Iet me use the phone.

279
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,195
I've seen your kick. You got something
Iike 40 cents to your name.

280
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,078
PIease! No! No! No!

281
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,195
AII right, Maricruz.
What are you doing? Come on.

282
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,955
- It's OK, Hector. You go ahead.
- What are you taIking about?

283
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,751
- I think I'm just gonna take a cab.
- What do you mean? You just got here.

284
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,234
He didn't caII you, did he?

285
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,869
Look. I Iove Fernando to death,
but the guy's a deadbeat.

286
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,554
You gotta move on with your Iife.

287
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,752
- Mr GiIes, we'd Iike a word with you.
- I reaIIy don't...

288
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,196
I'm afraid we're going to have to insist.

289
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,199
It's come to our attention that you made
a FOIL request on the Burrows case.

290
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,716
- Yeah. So?
- You made a dupe off the surveiIIance tape.

291
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,392
That's right.

292
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,235
- Mind us asking why?
- It was for one of Burrows' oId girIfriends.

293
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,438
She thought the guy was innocent.
I figured it'd heIp her with cIosure.

294
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,431
She's in possession of the tape now?

295
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,149
Don't puII that card with me.
It's the Freedom of Information Act.

296
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,677
- She's entitIed to that tape as much as you.
- No, no, no. By aII means. By aII means.

297
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,228
- May I go now?
- Just one more thing.

298
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,515
This oId girIfriend of his.

299
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,716
What's her name?

300
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,192
- Excuse me. Is this the Simmons residence?
- I'm Ms Simmons.

301
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,149
I'm sorry. Um, I'm Veronica Donovan.
I'm Iooking for Crab Simmons.

302
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,708
- Are you reIated?
- He's my son.

303
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,394
- Is he around?
- No.

304
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,553
- CouId you teII me where I couId find him?
- Lady, go away. I can't heIp you.

305
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,952
Look, I'm sorry.
It's just... a man's Iife is at stake,

306
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,429
and maybe your son couId heIp him.

307
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,556
Crab can't heIp nobody, Iady.

308
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,631
He's dead.

309
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,989
I'm sorry.

310
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,474
Heads up! Seven up, cons.
Stand at your gates.

311
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,590
About to jump off, fish.

312
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,636
BaIIard, get back on your number.

313
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,148
- Need backup right away.
- (guard) I said get back on your number.

314
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,634
(guard) Get back immediateIy!

315
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,914
HeIp me.

316
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,319
(guard) Inmates, back down!

317
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,072
ScofieId!

318
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,311
(guard) Inmates, back in your ceIIs!

319
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,914
(alarm)

320
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,359
(guard) Get back immediateIy!

321
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,238
You're a dead man, ScofieId.

322
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,550
Do you hear me?

323
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,393
You're a dead man!

324
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,633
I reaIIy don't know
what to say to you gentIemen.

325
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,909
I try to give you the benefit of the doubt.
I try to treat you with respect.

326
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,230
You can't even respect yourseIves.

327
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,111
So there's gonna be a 48-hour Iockdown.
No mess, no showers, no visitation.

328
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,512
And I strongIy suggest
that you aII Iearn to get aIong,

329
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,116
otherwise the next time it's gonna be a week
and the time after that, a month.

330
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,634
Think about it.

331
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,994
- (Wendy) Got a Leticia Barris on the Iine.
- I don't know who that is.

332
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,516
She says she used to date Crab Simmons.

333
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,832
- Thank you for caIIing.
- You wanna hear what l have to say?

334
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,357
- We meet in public where they can't get to us.
- Wait. Where who can't get to us?

335
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,149
You wanna hear what l have to say?
Cos if you don't, l'm gonna hang up now.

336
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,710
No, no, no, no.
You just name the time and the pIace.

337
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,791
- (Leticia) Over here.
- Hey, Leticia, thanks for coming.

338
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,158
We don't know each other. We'II stay out
here in the open where they can't get to us,

339
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,198
where they can't do what they do.

340
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,556
They gonna kiII your boy
Iike they kiIIed mine.

341
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,916
Coroner said smack kiIIed your boyfriend.
It was an overdose.

342
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,752
- No overdose.
- What do you mean?

343
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,992
Crab didn't use. He had a bad heart.
If he touched the stuff, it'd kiII him.

344
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,995
Don't you think it's just a bit of a coincidence
he OD'd a week after your boyfriend's crime?

345
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,755
They kiIIed him cos he knew things,
things they didn't wanna get out.

346
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,479
- Like what?
- Like who was reaIIy behind that hit.

347
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,236
It wasn't Crab and it wasn't LincoIn. Neither
of them knew what they were getting into.

348
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,676
They were just pawns in a big game.
They're here.

349
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,275
- Who's here, Leticia?
- Don't try to foIIow me. I won't testify.

350
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,319
- Just sIow down and taIk to me.
- I'd get as far away from here as you can, girI,

351
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,597
cos there ain't nobody they can't get to.

352
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,189
Leticia!

353
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,871
(phone rings)

354
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,350
- HeIIo?
- We have a smaII compIication.

355
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,476
There's a Iawyer poking around.

356
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,074
Veronica Donovan.

357
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,513
Yes.

358
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,754
You can handIe a girI who graduated
in the middIe of her BayIor Law SchooI cIass.

359
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:33,154
At Ieast, I'd Iike to think so, given the stakes
of what we're deaIing with here.

360
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,712
Anyone that's a threat to what we're doing
is expendabIe.

361
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,950
- Anyone.
- Understood.

362
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,429
Do what you need to do to make this go away.

363
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,511
(hangs up)

364
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,913
Are you there, pretty?

365
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,549
I know you're there.

366
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,757
Just want you to know I'm coming for you.

367
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,991
You got nowhere to run.

368
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,390
You're trapped in that IittIe hoIe of yours,

369
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,638
trapped Iike a pig I'm gonna sIaughter.

370
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,675
- Who's my one o'cIock?
- (woman) MichaeI ScofieId.

371
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,717
(C-Note) I was wrong about you.
Here's your PUGNAc.

372
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,598
- A IittIe bit Iate.
- Better Iate than never, right?

373
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,478
- ScofieId! Infirmary.
- We'II see about that.

374
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,551
Mm-hm.

375
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,511
I'm gonna find out, you know,
what it is you're doing up there.

376
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,559
- (Michael) How Iong does this take?
- They've come a Iong way with gIucose kits.

377
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,756
This'II take us about ten seconds.

378
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,594
SIide the strip into the meter
and we're ready to go.

379
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,835
I'm sure you know this, but average gIucose
for the non-diabetic is about 100mg/dI,

380
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,313
so we see a number Iike that here
and we know you've been misdiagnosed.

381
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,674
You seem nervous.

382
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,399
- I do?
- You're sweating.

383
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,155
Must be the needIes.
Never reaIIy got used to 'em.

384
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,798
Somehow with diabetes and that tattoo
I find that hard to beIieve.

385
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,836
Ah.

386
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,789
Bad news, I'm afraid.

387
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,117
180mg/dI. You're definiteIy diabetic.

388
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,155
Do you need anything eIse from me?

389
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,471
- Arm to stick a needIe in.
- OK.

390
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,313
I'II see you Wednesday.

391
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,675
- (woman) Cute.
- Prisoner.

392
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,871
- There's something strange about him.
- What do you mean?

393
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,717
I gave him the resuIts of his bIood test and
there was this Iook on his face. It was, um...

394
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,234
reIief.

395
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,951
It's aII right. I got it.
I'm headed over to A-wing anyhow.

396
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,679
(whistles cheerfully)

397
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,357
- You're positiveIy beaming, boss.
- Got up on the right side of the bed, I guess.

398
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,715
HoId up. Sugar.

399
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,189
Now, don't you move, fishy.

400
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,718
- (Michael) What are you doing?
- (man) You're coming with us, fish.

I wanna know how you got to him
and where he is, right now.

407
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,029
Not gonna happen, John.

408
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,160
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

409
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,069
- One...
- I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

You know it and I know it.

..two...

412
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,192
I'II teII you the moment
we're outside those waIIs.

You teII me now.

414
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,840
- Not gonna happen, John.
- Hey! I'm gonna give you one Iast chance.
