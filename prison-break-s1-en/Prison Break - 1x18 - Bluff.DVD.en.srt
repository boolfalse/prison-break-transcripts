311
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,873
Either you gonna see his bet

312
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,038
or you can go outside
and MiIIion Con March

313
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,672
or whatever your peopIe do.

314
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,115
Either way, get on with it, son.

315
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:44,849
I'm in.

316
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,957
Three bitches, bitches.

317
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,657
What you hoIding?

318
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,702
You teII me.

319
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,737
-FuII house.
-A fuII house?

320
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:08,006
That's a concept a Mexican shouId be
quite famiIiar with, eh, Jesus?

321
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,407
(CHUCKLING)

322
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,711
She said what?

323
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,483
She said, in unequivocaI terms,
that I was not to move on Burrows.

324
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,686
Whatever their agenda is with Burrows,
it is not the same as ours.

325
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,461
This whoIe business with his father,

326
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,794
it interferes with the one thing
that we set out to do in the first pIace.

327
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,094
Put LincoIn Burrows in the ground.

328
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,834
If he Iives,

329
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,729
you're the one that stands to Iose,
not the Company.

330
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,569
They get themseIves another candidate,

331
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,905
and you're the one
that suffers the brunt of it.

332
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,002
Then maybe it's time we broke ranks.

333
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,342
We do that,
they puII support for the campaign.

334
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,611
You know that, don't you?

335
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:51,018
That is, if they know, PauI.

336
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,119
(SNIFFING) SmeII that kitty.

337
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,124
Jacks or better, Trips to win.

338
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:07,969
Last hand.

339
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,069
I'm tired of Iosing aII my money today.

340
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,310
-How much you up?
-I don't know. $300.

341
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,882
-Does it hurt?
-What?

342
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,679
The horseshoe up your ass.

343
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,379
Rather be Iucky than good, ping-pong.

344
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,258
MisdeaI. Bury the card.

345
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:37,159
-Man, I don't care if you aII saw my card.
-Yeah, I bet you don't.

346
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,834
-Bury the card, young bIood.
-Hey, chiII, wrinkIes.

347
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,471
Ain't my fauIt saItine here
got a sIoppy deaI.

348
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,270
That there was just uncaIIed for.

349
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,072
Now, aII right. You know what?
I'II teII you what.

350
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:50,579
I'm gonna deaI another hand,
you gonna be such a baby about it.

351
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:56,886
On a misdeaI, you bury the card,
finish out the hand.

352
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,422
House ruIes.

353
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,351
-Warden.
-I have some good news for you, Linc.

354
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,931
Somehow, your Iawyer's
petition went through.

355
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,367
The Department of Corrections
is aIIowing you a one-hour visit

356
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,959
with your son.

357
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,303
I've never seen
one of these granted before, ever.

358
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,379
-Good Iawyers.
-No Iawyer's that good.

359
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,875
I'II make the traveI arrangements,

360
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,610
but this is not going to be
a ride in the country.

361
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,084
You're gonna be y-cuffed,
and the men are gonna be heaviIy armed.

362
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:06,521
-I don't want any probIems.
-There won't be, I just want to see my son.

363
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,938
I'II bet aII I got.

364
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,372
$82.

365
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,086
You better have some aces
shoved up there with that horseshoe,

366
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,916
or that pot's mine.

367
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,250
You in or out?

368
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,117
I'm in.

369
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,424
And I raise you $74.

370
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:24,359
-I said I onIy got $82 Ieft.
-WeII, then I guess you're out of Iuck.

371
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:28,565
-You never heard of a gentIeman's game?
-Yes, I have, but this ain't it.

372
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:31,699
You want to borrow some money?
Ask your boys.

373
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,801
But I'm in here to make money, bro.

374
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,041
You want weIfare,
you'd better vote Democrat.

375
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:57,430
If you know what's good for you,
you'II stay away from me in the yard.

376
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,038
(SIGHING)

377
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,450
You think you're smarter than me?

378
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,930
(ALARM BLARING)

379
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,805
No, no, no!

380
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,711
Okay, there's a pathway.
No, there's a pathway! There's a pathway!

381
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,841
Look, he's trying to escape!
He's trying to escape. This is his map!

382
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,579
-Haywire, I need you to come back!
-He set me up!

383
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,951
-Zap him !
-No! No!

384
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,470
There he is.

385
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,237
Hey, boss.
I think you dropped something, man.

386
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,808
That's haIf a G-note.

387
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,944
-So when do I move in?
-You don't.

388
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,112
What?

389
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:29,423
-Oh, come on, chief, now, we had a deaI.
-Renegotiation, the price is $700 now.

390
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,160
That ain't right. I just gave you $500.

391
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:37,598
What you gave me was a down payment.
If you can't come up with the rest, weII...

392
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,136
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait. Just hoId on.

393
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,103
One minute, aII right?

394
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,077
Oh, man, he's trying to shake us down.

395
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,647
-I'm gonna need that watch.
-Not an option.

396
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:54,514
Look, wouId you rather be
Iooking at a picture of your daughter

397
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,782
or hoIding her in your arms
once you get outside?

398
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,704
Hey, Iook, man,
Father Time owed me a few bones.

399
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,714
He gave me this in trade.

400
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,444
That shouId be
more than enough to cover it.

401
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,814
Not bad.

402
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,053
Your probIem is somebody
aIready gave me $700 for the ceII,

403
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,919
so, you're S.O.L.

No! No! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa !

405
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,458
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Look.

406
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,190
So you're just gonna
take my money and waIk?

407
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,892
Yeah, weII, write to your congressman.

408
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,738
Oh, come on!

00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,578
-Hey.
-Hi.

00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:07,089
-They said you wanted to taIk to me.
-Yeah, yeah.

412
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:08,784
Okay.

413
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,652
Good.

414
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,363
PIease.

415
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,462
Thanks.

416
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,702
I made you something.

417
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,839
It's an ashtray.

418
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,045
-I don't smoke.
-Yeah, I know.

419
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:36,484
But they onIy
Iet us make these and jeweIry,

420
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,116
and I didn't figure you
for the macaroni neckIace type.

421
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,850
It's very sweet.

422
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,590
How about we taIk
about how you're doing?

423
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,730
I think we both know I don't beIong here.

424
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:55,033
I don't remember much about that night,
but being Iocked up in ad seg,

425
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,164
something must've snapped.

426
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,576
What I'm trying to say is,
I think I've had enough of arts and crafts.

427
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:05,980
But that's your caII.

428
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,746
And the doctors here
do say that you've been acting fine.

429
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,219
The probIem is that
if you don't teII the Pope who burned you,

430
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,586
he's gonna Iock you back up in ad seg.

431
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,650
And after a coupIe days of that,
you're gonna be right back here.

432
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,492
MichaeI, I hate what happened to you,
and I hate that you're here.

433
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,094
But you have got to Iet me heIp you.

434
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,210
If you want to get out of psych ward,
and stay out,

435
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,747
you've got to teII the Pope
the truth about that burn.

436
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,080
Out with the oId, in with the new, cons.

437
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,364
I got a message from your ceIIie, bro.

438
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,559
He says he's okay
and he's trying to fiII in the bIanks.

439
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,865
Did he say he's trying,
or that he aIready got the bIanks fiIIed in?

440
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,133
Yo, man, I don't know.
I didn't write it down.

441
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,267
Okay. Now you gotta teII him
that I fiIIed in the hoIe.

442
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:10,040
Yeah, yeah, I'm done
with your IittIe secrets and messages, bro.

443
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,945
I saw ScofieId's back.

444
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,417
He's got a burn in the same spot
as the burn in that guard's shirt.

445
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,956
I don't know what you're doing
but I have an idea, huh?

446
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:23,123
And I'm through heIping you
untiI you teII me what's going on.

447
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,717
I can't, bro.

448
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:28,161
-Then good Iuck in the hoIe, jefe,
-No, no, no! Wait, wait.

449
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,460
LINCOLN: Manche.

450
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,260
-Who's that?
-That's Linc, bro.

451
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,236
-Linc the Sink?
-Yeah.

452
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,636
Come here.

453
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,555
I think we can work something out.

454
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:56,021
AII I can say is, before I get out of here,
Geary wiII pay. BeIieve that.

455
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,825
No one's getting out of here

456
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,194
if maintenance goes to
repIacing ScofieId's toiIet.

457
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,059
I got a way to heIp you
with your ScofieId probIem.

458
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:08,002
-What'd you say, sIim?
-I said I got a way to heIp you with...

459
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:12,472
-Who the heII said we had a probIem?
-It's cooI, man. ReIax.

460
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,670
LincoIn and Sucre toId me everything.

461
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,907
What in the heII did they teII you?
ExactIy, what did they teII you?

462
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:22,475
Everything. They said I can come with you,
you know, on earIy paroIe,

463
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,351
if I can heIp get the Fish out of psych.

464
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,782
What are we, the A train?
Everyone gets to ride with us?

465
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,628
Why don't you take a waIk,
before I give you a smack?

466
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,567
You got another soIution to our situation?

467
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,034
I didn't think so.

468
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:51,544
Me and my cuz and LincoIn

469
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,845
came up with something.

470
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,613
Now, it can work, but it's risky.

471
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,272
You ready to get out of
this aquarium, Fish?

472
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,363
Assure me I'II be protected.

(DOOR BUZZING)

474
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,269
MichaeI, you know me
weII enough by now.

475
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,776
Such assurances are not necessary.

476
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:31,173
With aII due respect, Warden,
if I had been protected in the first pIace,

477
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,648
none of this wouId have happened.

478
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,852
-A name.
-Geary.

479
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,157
Geary?

480
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,259
He shakes cons down for money,
anything he can get his hands on.

481
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,198
He knew I went to coIIege, so he must've...

482
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,501
He must've thought
I was rich or something.

483
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,839
Anyway, when I couIdn't pay up,

484
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:05,348
he heId me down with one arm,
and burned me with the other.

485
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,078
I don't know what he used,

486
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,490
but it was hot as heII.

487
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,327
What a surprise. Disconnected.

488
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:26,935
Two-hundred and fifty businesses,
72 residences, covering aII 50 states.

489
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:30,940
-London, Martinique, Jakarta, Dakar.
-AII the numbers out of service.

490
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,270
As soon as Quinn disappeared,

491
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,401
they must've
erased the paper traiI within days.

492
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,810
Is there anything they can't do?

493
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,650
My P.I. buddy in DC.
What if I send him aII this,

494
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,550
see if he can make
a connection between the numbers?

495
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,714
I'II teII him I need it ASAP.

496
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,985
-Thank you.
-Oh, it's no big deaI.

497
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,857
I'II just overnight him aII this stuff.

498
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,326
No. For everything.

499
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,429
For hanging in there, keeping me going.

500
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,767

-Sure.

Sucks at his job, he stiII gets a raise.

503
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,879
You suck at your job.
You shouId ask the Pope for a raise.

504
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,347
Very funny.

505
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,284
Warden, what brings you
to our IittIe cIubhouse?

506
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,421
Hey, what gives?

507
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,751
Hey, that was a gift from my oId man.

508
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,985
Since when is your name CharIes
and your dad's name Ann?

509
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:33,024
This is a raiIroad. I didn't do nothing!

510
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:37,326
Don't Iook at me Iike I'm some con.
You're as crooked as scoIiosis.

511
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,232
I don't get caught.

512
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:16,231
When we get there,

513
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,002
I'II take you out of the y-cuffs
and put you in a four-piece.

514
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,373
-Got it?
-Got it, boss.

515
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,972
You pIay nice, I pIay nice.

516
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,809
-Understand?
-Got it.

517
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,666
She's here. I've got her.

-WeIcome home.
-Thanks.

522
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:15,263
Never thought
I'd be so gIad to be back in my ceII.

523
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,697
Pope wanted me to give you this.
