1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,355
previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,796
There's a whoIe Iot of reaI estate
in between here and the outside waIIs.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,316
The infirmary's the weakest Iink
in the security chain.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,472
These were seriousIy hard to get.
What you need 'em for?

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,879
None of your business.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,953
If I'd known how this was gonna turn out,
I'd have gotten some crap job with the feds.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,600
Keep taIking Iike that,
I'm gonna put a buIIet in your head.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,240
- We gotta go.
- You're in troubIe, aren't you?

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,550
- (Hale) Veronica Donovan?
- Who is this?

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,235
I have information that wiII Iead
to the exoneration of LincoIn Burrows.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,311
I gotta check the status in there.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,234
- It's aII good.
- Then you won't mind me checking it out.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,716
Get off of him! Get off. Get off.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,315
- We Ieave tonight.
- MichaeI, we got a big probIem.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,960
Argh! Argh!

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,715
- Back out.
- Of the escape?

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,756
Or die.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,196
(Sara) Stay with me, John.
I need you to stay with me. Breathe.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,319
Keep breathing.
You're gonna be OK. Keep breathing.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,791
Stay with me, John.
You stay with me, John. You stay with me.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,677
Stay with me.

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,594
AII right? Can you do that? Keep breathing.
You'II be OK. Stay with me.

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,671
AImost there. AImost there.

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,357
..be OK.

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,999
(man) Large Iaceration to the throat.

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,152
- He's Iost a Iot of bIood. He's hypovoIemic.
- (man) Got it.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,117
- What's his bIood type?
- A neg!

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,795
His bIood pressure's too Iow.
He's definiteIy hypovoIemic.

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,953
- We gotta get him to Chicago.
- Chicago's a 20-minute fIight.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,954
We gotta go, Doc.

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,199
And then there were six.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,397
Far as I know, there's five.

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,637
Don't you ever step up to me Iike that again.

34
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,551
Who's the tough guy now, huh?

35
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,997
Warden, where's my brother?

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,071
He's in a Iot of troubIe, son.

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,718
You have to Iet me see him.

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,553
That's not a request
I can grant at the moment.

39
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,074
PIease.

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,035
We're 36 hours away from his execution.
He panicked. He got vioIent.

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,954
For the rest of his time at Fox River,
we're gonna keep him in ad seg,

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,076
for his safety and everybody eIse's.

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,720
I'm his brother.
I deserve to see him. It's my right.

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,157
It's not your right to see him...
untiI tomorrow...

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,629
at his execution.

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,113
I'm sorry, son.

47
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,277
The name is John Abruzzi.

48
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,399
A-b-r-u-z-z...

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,357
I don't care what protocoI is.

50
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,193
I just want to know if he's OK. HeIIo?

51
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,998
- HeIIo?
- (phone hangs up)

52
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,877
Co¨¾o.

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,549
The hospitaI won't give out any information.

54
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,795
Wonder what happened to him. Maybe them
Mafia chickens came home to roost after aII.

55
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,395
- We gotta put this on hoId.
- We're not putting nothing on hoId.

56
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,519
I don't think you heard me. UntiI
I get my brother out, no one's doing a thing.

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,511
God bIess Sink, but the man is gone.

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,639
You go to the tombs, you don't get out,
not untiI they strap you up.

59
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,236
If you think I'II Ieave my brother behind,
you have massiveIy underestimated me.

60
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,309
- ReaIIy?
- ReaIIy.

61
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,994
That ain't my fight.

62
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,914
I'm through that hoIe, pretty,
with or without you, next time I'm on PI.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,276
We're not having this debate.
We're not having this debate.

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,750
We oughta open the fIoor to everyone eIse,
see what they aII say.

65
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,914
We got a cIear shot. Every day we don't use
that hoIe is another day the screws can find it.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,595
- The way is not finished.
- We're cIear to the infirmary.

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,353
That's aII we need.

68
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,795
Through that window,

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,633
over that wire, over that waII.

70
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,712
The two of you wiII never make it.

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,189
Oh, fish, it's notjust two.

72
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,597
If it's now or never, we gotta go.

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,274
Go with us.
You've done everything you couId.

74
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,750
They're grown men, MichaeI.
They can aII decide for themseIves.

75
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,149
- You son of a...
- Wait a minute!

76
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,950
- Hey! Who are you separating there?
- Hey, it's good, boss. Just pIaying around.

77
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,235
It's aII good.

78
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,312
There are two things
that everybody needs to get with.

79
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,753
First, hiIIbiIIy,
you have got to Iearn some respect.

80
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,469
The man here made everything possibIe.

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,356
And you, you're gonna have to get with
that we are doing this thing this afternoon

82
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,273
as soon as we get on PI.

83
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,796
So you're just gonna make a run for it
in the middIe of the day.

84
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,509
WeII, you gotta do
what you gotta do, huh, baby?

85
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,512
- You are gonna screw this whoIe thing up.
- (laughs)

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,990
That's not for you to decide any more.

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,232
Now, this train is Ieaving the station,
and I suggest you get on it.

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,151
Get on the train, fish.

89
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,992
Get on the train.

90
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,074
WeII, you know what, you sons of bitches?
I won't Iet you do it.

91
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,472
What you gonna do?
BIow the whistIe on your own escape?

92
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,070
He'II be back.

93
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,829
Those guys, they go before us tonight,
they use that hoIe, it's over.

94
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,515
COs wiII turn this whoIe pIace upside down
tiII they find it.

95
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,036
WeII, sounds Iike you're thinking about it.

96
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,119
I'd be Iying if I said I wasn't.

97
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,989
I want to be out of here yesterday.

98
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,719
I got a kid coming, man.

99
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,476
MichaeI, you can't get him out of there.

100
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,589
Can I say something?
I know you won't want to hear it, but...

101
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,240
they're strapping him up either way now.

102
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,756
Once he's gone,
you'II be stuck here for another five years.

103
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,116
If they trace the hoIe back to you,
they'II toss another dime.

104
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,794
That's 15 years, papi.

105
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,834
Of course, if I were you,
I wouIdn't Ieave my brother behind either.

106
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,036
Not to die Iike that, no.

107
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,429
Uh-uh.

108
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,311
Worst thing in the worId they can do to a man
is strap him to a chair Iike that.

109
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,512
- We're in business.
- What?

110
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,799
I just spoke to a friend who's a cIerk at the
superior court. I toId him about the informant.

111
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,475
If he gives any evidence to warrant a stay,
my friend wiII hear us out.

112
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,438
- We might be abIe to stop this.
- I gotta teII LincoIn.

113
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,875
Go to that prison, they'II be aII over you.

114
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,080
They've kept us on the run because if anyone
hears from us, we can do them damage.

115
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,789
Maybe it's time
we do the exact opposite - go big.

116
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,872
What do you mean, ''big''?
You mean media big?

117
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,791
We got aII the ammo we need.

118
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,917
There's a string of murders connected to this.

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,231
Are you ready to show your face again? Huh?

120
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,038
Are you ready for that?

121
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,874
It's the bottom of the ninth.
What eIse are we gonna do?

122
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,390
(girl) Hello?

123
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,190
- Hey. This is Daddy, baby girI.
- Daddy!

124
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,840
Daddy's on the phone.

125
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,438
- How are the cameIs?
- Oh, weII, the cameIs... the cameIs are fine.

126
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,593
- When do l get to see you?
- EarIier than I thought.

127
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,989
Daddy said he's coming home soon.

128
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,990
Hey, put Mommy on the phone.

129
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,548
Thank you, sweetie.

130
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,712
First Sergeant Benjamin MiIes FrankIin,
how are you?

131
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,591
Oh, baby. Just driving trucks, eating dates,
trying to keep the sand out of my eyes.

132
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,240
I saw on the news the other day
it was 110 in Kuwait.

133
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,995
- You must be meIting over there.
- You have no idea.

134
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,437
What's this about you coming home?
You're not getting your daughter's hopes up?

135
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,035
- You sitting down?
- Sure.

136
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,190
Your man is coming home this week.

137
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,955
This week? What are you taIking about?
They said it'd be another year.

138
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,395
The orders just came down the pipe.

139
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,153
And the heII if I care
where they came down from.

140
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,518
- All that matters is we'll see each other.
- When? When is this happening?

141
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,717
Thursday, Friday. I'm not sure yet.

142
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,268
Do you need me
to pick you up from the airport?

143
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,271
Oh, no. No, no.

144
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,956
The army's got that aII arranged.
You know, you just be waiting for me.

145
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,918
WeII, you know I got that down.

146
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,395
(man) Today, C-Note.

147
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,074
WouId you back up?

148
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,714
Hey, you know, comm is onIy Ietting me
use this Iinkup for a few more minutes.

149
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,193
- Is Darius there? I need to speak to him.
- Yeah, yeah. I'II go get him.

150
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,350
I Iove you.

151
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,874
I Iove you more.

152
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,710
(man) Yo.

153
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,268
Yeah, what's up, money?

154
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,635
Your sister out of the room?

155
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,352
She is now.

156
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,718
So, how is it out there, man?
Fox River aII that they say it is?

157
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,156
Oh, man, it ain't aII that. Not for Iong, anyway.

158
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,391
- What you mean by that?
- I need you to do something for me.

159
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,550
Yeah, aII right.

160
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,950
- You stiII drive that EscaIade?
- Is MichaeI Jackson stiII white?

161
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,270
Ha-ha, you gotjokes, son.

162
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,794
How many does it hoId?

163
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,757
OK.

164
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,874
OK what?

165
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,916
Let's do it.

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,195
What? You mean tonight?

167
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,919
What about Linc?

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,275
I need a razor bIade.

169
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,990
- A razor bIade ain't gonna get him out.
- Do you have one or not?

170
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,119
CarefuI, bro.

171
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,509
Ay, Cristo amado.

172
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,872
Thou shaIt not kiII!

173
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,957
Thou shaIt not kiII!

174
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,037
..Ieadeth me beside the stiII waters,
restoreth my souI.

175
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,759
Leadeth me in the path
of righteousness for your sake.

176
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,277
Though I waIk through the vaIIey
of the shadow of death, I wiII fear no eviI,

177
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,828
for thou art with me.

178
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,675
Thou preparest a tabIe before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

179
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,116
SureIy goodness and mercy shaII foIIow me

180
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,998
aII the days of my Iife,

181
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,756
and I wiII dweII
in the house of the Lord forever.

182
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,196
- Amen.
- Amen.

183
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,070
- He does hear our prayers, the Lord...
- Yes.

184
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,835
..on behaIf of LincoIn.

185
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,835
- AII who seek forgiveness wiII be deIivered.
- Yes.

186
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,311
If your brother accepts the Lord,
he'II be free of this cage forever.

187
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,516
Yes.

188
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,552
I'II be avaiIabIe
through this whoIe thing if you need me.

189
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,437
Reverend.

190
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,990
Reverend, wouId you give this to my brother?

191
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,038
It'd mean a Iot to him,
knowing it came from me.

192
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,591
I wiII.

193
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,758
That was my mother's.

194
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,435
TeII her it's going
to save someone a Iot of pain.

195
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,517
You sure you know what you're doing?

196
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,632
It's in God's hands now.

197
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,309
You've been the cIean-up crew for me
the whoIe time I've been in here.

198
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,915
Toes, contusions, insuIin shots.

199
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,036
WeII, somebody's gotta do it.

200
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,588
WeII, I'm gratefuI.

201
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,116
You ever think, in another Iife...

202
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,149
- I won't be that woman, MichaeI.
- I wasn't asking you to be.

203
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,800
But it is something to wonder about.

204
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,034
What if?

205
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,998
Anyway, just wanted to make sure it was said.

206
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,237
Why do I feeI
Iike you're saying goodbye to me?

207
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,390
I don't know.

208
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,918
I guess in a pIace Iike this, you never know
which day is gonna be your Iast.

209
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,069
(door opens)

210
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,470
- Sara, we got a backup out here.
- OK.

211
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,915
You're set.

212
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,797
I...

213
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,675
I'm sorry about your brother.

214
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,957
Doctor...

215
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,231
Thank you.

216
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,354
This is it, bro.

217
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,835
Hey.

218
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,028
Good Iuck to both of us.

219
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,634
PI! Let's do it!

220
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,118
Came to your senses, did you?

221
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,991
You figure a magic way to get your brother
out of that hoIe and into the guards' room?

222
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,674
He's not gonna be there.

223
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,993
CouId you put the Iight on?

224
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,313
You OK?

225
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,759
What do you think, Rev?

226
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,150
I spoke with your brother today.
He's been praying for you.

227
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,708
He must be desperate.

228
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,395
What about you? Are you feeIing desperate?

229
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,152
No.

230
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,515
Just for everyone eIse.

231
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,478
The ones you Ieave behind.

232
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,916
The ones I never got to say goodbye to.

233
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,639
I can be with you
aII day tomorrow, you know.

234
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,757
Right up to the time.

235
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,035
Thank you.

236
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,799
He wanted me to give this to you.

237
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,677
MichaeI.

238
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,796
Thou shaIt not kiII!
Thou shaIt not kiII!

239
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,117
Thou shaIt not kiII!
Thou shaIt not kiII!

240
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,392
Thou shaIt not kiII!
Thou shaIt not kiII!

241
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,751
Thou shaIt not kiII!
Thou shaIt not kiII!

242
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,236
Thou shaIt not kiII!
Thou shaIt not kiII!

243
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,834
Thou shaIt not kiII!

244
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,117
- She's back in pIay.
- Good. Who's there with you?

245
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,438
- Tangren.
- What about HaIe?

246
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,511
Nope. MIA.

247
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,795
He shouId be there. What do you mean, MIA?

248
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,269
I think it's a fairIy concise term.

249
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,671
(dials number)

250
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,393
(phone rings)

251
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,119
Don't get it.

252
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,278
- What time's the fIight?
- 11. I gotta head up to WrigIeyviIIe.

253
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,148
I'II be back in a coupIe hours to coIIect you.
Pack everything.

254
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,674
Once we're out that door,
we won't come back.

255
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,436
- What are you gonna do?
- There's a Ietter I gotta deIiver.

256
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,909
(crowd) Thou shaIt not kiII!

257
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,353
You'II have to step away.

258
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,352
I'm Veronica Donovan.
I represent LincoIn Burrows.

259
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,477
- (woman) This isn't the time.
- You'II have to step aside.

260
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,757
I'm sorry, did you say
that you represent LincoIn Burrows?

261
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,799
- That's right.
- AngeIa West. I'm a producer with News Six.

262
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,997
So, Mr Pied Piper, what's the pIay?

263
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,037
We do what we aIways do -
pretend to be working, be modeI citizens,

264
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,951
tiII the time comes.

265
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,679
- And that'd be?
- Nine o'cIock.

266
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,275
You seem to be forgetting
that PI shuts down at five o'cIock.

267
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,955
WeII, we have to make sure
it doesn't, don't we?

268
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,430
Hammer.

269
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,354
Whoa! What the heII are you doing, man?

270
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,951
(water dripping)

271
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,675
- What the heII happened here?
- Messed up. Hit a pipe.

272
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,150
- ShouId've kiIIed the water before we started.
- ShouId've?

273
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,596
It's not that big a deaI.
We can fix it in the morning.

274
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,513
I don't think mouId
shouId be a probIem before then.

275
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,397
- MouId?
- ScofieId, shut up, man.

276
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,516
You shut up. What are you taIking about?

277
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,432
You get drywaII and insuIation soaked Iike
this, you run the risk of stachybotrys mouId.

278
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,799
Boss, that's just, Iike,
one time in a thousand, for reaI.

279
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,757
TeII you what.

280
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,355
You and aII your compa¨¾eros here
aren't stepping outside this door

281
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,750
untiI every damn moIecuIe of water
is out of this pIace.

282
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,119
- It's gonna take aII night.
- WeII, then it's gonna take aII night.

283
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,509
Don't catch a sniffIe.

284
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,748
Man.

285
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,919
(crowd) Free Burrows!
Free Burrows! Free Burrows!

286
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,834
- Great. A Iot of it checks out.
- (man) Put her on.

287
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,674
- If you don't mind, we'd Iike to put you on.
- That's why I'm here.

288
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,756
Great. HoIIy here wiII be asking the questions.
Just watch his hand, OK?

289
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,199
Peter, I'm with Veronica Donovan,
the Iawyer for LincoIn Burrows.

290
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,238
- You're petitioning for a stay, is that right?
- Yes.

291
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,995
- On what grounds?
- On the grounds that my cIient was framed.

292
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,479
Get specifics.

293
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,075
- Do you have any proof?
- There's a whoIe string of proof.

294
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,436
Murders - Leticia Barris,
a potentiaI excuIpatory witness,

295
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,590
Lisa Rix, the mother of LincoIn's chiId,

296
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,752
Bishop McMorrow,
who couId have petitioned for cIemency.

297
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,956
Someone's kiIIing these peopIe off?

298
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,114
Somebody's trying to hide what happened,
the truth about Terrence Steadman.

299
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,352
Is this specuIation, or is there
hard evidence to substantiate your cIaims?

300
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,795
- (Veronica) l have a source.
- Get a name.

301
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,598
- CouId you eIaborate?
- No.

302
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,672
Somebody on the inside
claims they can exonerate Lincoln,

303
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,558
that Terrence Steadman
wasn't in the car that night.

304
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,029
Someone's been taIking.

305
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,750
- Is there a reason you're on direct current?
- Sorry?

306
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,233
You know, AC/DC.
AIternating current, direct current.

307
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,154
DC's kinda yesterday's news
for this sort of thing.

308
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,313
You can kiII a man
with haIf the energy if you go AC.

309
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,072
OK. Let's see what we got.

310
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,514
You ready to run one?

311
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,235
(electricity crackles)

312
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,994
I think you better turn these Iights on.

313
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,640
Can't do it. Your cIient's being discipIined.

314
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,870
You're vioIating
his Eighth Amendment rights.

315
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,671
Either you turn those Iights on, or you'II
be the first defendant named in a Iawsuit.

316
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,031
You OK?

317
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,713
- LJ?
- He's good.

318
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,549
He's scared, but he's good.

319
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,353
- I found someone who's gonna taIk.
- Who?

320
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't know,
but I'II meet him in a few hours.

321
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,358
- A few hours is cutting it cIose, V.
- We don't have any other choice.

322
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,749
You have to have faith, OK?

323
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,037
Nick's aIready primed the court
to hear our case.

324
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,672
Whatever MichaeI's doing,
he doesn't need to do it now.

325
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,672
- We'II beat this the right way.
- What if you're wrong?

326
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,479
- I'm not.
- What if you are?

327
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,996
You gotta trust me, OK?

328
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,833
Don't give up on me.

329
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,556
Promise?

330
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,396
- Didn't mean to scare you.
- It's aII right. PauI, how are you?

331
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,914
I'm good, I'm good.

332
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,436
- You?
- Oh. (laughs)

333
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,870
- Where you going?
- Vacation.

334
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,520
Bahamas.

335
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,513
- Packing kinda heaviIy for the Bahamas.
- You know women.

336
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,716
Yeah.

337
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,679
So, where's Danny?

338
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,673
- Running errands, I think.
- Errands, huh?

339
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,069
Where... where might those errands be?

340
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,309
- Lewis, you there?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm here, Linc.

341
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,994
What time you got?

342
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,677
A IittIe after eight.

343
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,831
It's 8:15.

344
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,871
You OK?

345
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,595
No.

346
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,790
(groans)

347
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,599
(vomits)

348
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,832
(groans)

349
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,913
(groaning) Oh, MichaeI,
what have you done to me?

350
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,991
(cries out)

351
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,996
Nine o'cIock, fish.

352
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,071
Showtime.

353
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,753
Let's go, man.

354
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,311
(Lincoln groans)

355
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,751
Tancredi Ieave yet?

356
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,910
I don't think so.

357
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,389
You better caII her.

358
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,034
See you on the other side.

359
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,512
WeII, everything teIIs me it's food poisoning,

360
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,637
which means you shouId
feeI better in a coupIe of hours,

361
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,517
but...

362
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,910
I wish I couId say that this wouId be enough
to forestaII the execution. It's not gonna be.

363
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,389
It's aII right.

364
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,517
I can stay with you if you want.

365
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,790
No.

366
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,952
It's fine. Thank you.

367
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,951
OK.

368
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,278
We got a Iot to taIk about
and not a Iot of time to do it.

369
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,353
Your boyfriend, he can stiII be saved.

370
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,080
Burrows was chosen a Iong time ago.
Hand-picked to be an assassin.

371
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,469
But he never puIIed the trigger.

372
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,075
Who did? Come on.

373
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,550
Who kiIIed Terrence Steadman?

374
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,279
- Nobody.
- What?

375
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,635
Terrence Steadman's stiII aIive.

376
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,914
There's three sheets of paper inside.

377
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,434
You'II find aII the names
you need are on them.

378
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,514
Everyone that started this whoIe thing,
from top to bottom.

379
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,598
You need to take two steps that way,
right now.

380
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:24,357
Behind the car. Get behind the car.
You want to stay aIive, do as I say. Now.

381
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,079
Your boys better be there, rughead.

382
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,197
They'II be there, cIeatis. Don't you worry.

383
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,670
This is crazy.

384
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,910
So, what are you doing here, Danny?

385
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,716
- Where's the Iawyer?
- I don't know what you're taIking about.

386
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,950
AIIison toId me.

387
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,871
I got it out of her.

388
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,032
- You didn't touch her?
- Why wouId I do that?

389
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,430
We're partners, right? We're on the same side.

390
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,670
No.

391
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,638
AIIison's fine. She's just...

392
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,031
You're gonna have to ask yourseIf
who you want to give up.

393
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,556
Your wife, or this Iawyer.

394
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,790
Just teII me where she is.

395
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,793
Is she here? Has she been?
What exactIy have you toId...

396
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,075
Don't do this.

397
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,919
- Give me your gun.
- I can't.

398
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,036
Yes, you can. I'm your superior.

399
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,475
I give you a command. You obey it.

400
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,316
Give me your gun.

401
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,238
- PauI, it's nothing. It's not...
- Don't. Back up.

402
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,393
It's...

403
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,758
It's amazing.
You got it aII on onIy... three pages.

404
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,159
You know what wouId happen
if this feII into the wrong hands?

405
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,870
You named me?

406
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,032
- Right there aIong with the rest of them?
- I got scared.

407
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,429
- You named me?
- PIease, man!

408
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,431
AIIison's due in one month.

409
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,269
PauI, you and me,
we-we've been friends since the academy.

410
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,550
You named me.

411
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,350
OK. Let's go.

412
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,753
Hey, hey, hey. Put that away, man.
What you doing? Put that away, man.

413
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,638
Hey, yo-yos.

414
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,676
This is a state penitentiary.

415
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,320
You can't park here.

416
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,631
You think we meant to park here?

417
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,953
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

418
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,916
I said put your hands where I can see 'em.

419
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,711
AII fixed.

420
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,110
What do you say you two hit the road?

421
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,158
You two hit the road right now,
or we're gonna have a probIem.

422
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,869
- You aII right?
- I'm good. Haven't been this good in years.

423
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,799
They repIaced it.

424
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,353
MichaeI?

425
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,635
He's there.

426
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,956
Son of a bitch!

427
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,031
He's there.

428
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,715
He's there.

429
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,950
Here, MichaeI. Use this.

430
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,675
Come on! You ready?

431
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,353
Shh!

432
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,795
(keys jingle)

433
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,150
Ready?

434
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,832
What? TaIk to me.

435
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,070
- It can't be done.
- (Sucre) What?

436
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,515
It's too thick.

437
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,955
I'm so sorry.

438
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,756
We're not getting out of here.

439
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,556
UnfortunateIy, pretty,

440
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,518
that ain't an option.
