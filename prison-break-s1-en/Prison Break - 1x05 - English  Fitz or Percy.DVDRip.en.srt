1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,230
(man) previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,309
I didn't kiII him.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,595
- The evidence says you did.
- I was set up.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,232
put down your weapon.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,959
I find it incumbent
you see the inside of a ceII.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,669
- I'm Iooking for Burrows.
- (Sucre) Man kiIIed the VP's brother.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,194
- Why do you want to see him?
- He's my brother.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,350
- I'm getting you out.
- ImpossibIe.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,953
Not if you designed the pIace.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,750
- You've seen the bIueprints.
- Better.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,637
I've got 'em on me.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,393
- You find out who's trying to bury him.
- Nobody is.

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,674
The evidence was cooked.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,515
- There's a Iawyer poking around.
- Anyone that's a threat is expendabIe.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,950
- I'm gonna kiII that scum.
- You kiII him, you kiII our ticket out of here.

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,315
- Where's Maricruz?
- She's with me now.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,391
Fish, I gotta be back in.

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,838
Nick, Project Justice. My boss may not think
LincoIn's case is worth Iooking into, but I do.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,273
When do we get started?

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,316
This waII is just the beginning.

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,676
There's a Iot of reaI estate
in between here and the outside.

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,198
That is a transfer request. MichaeI ScofieId
is getting shipped out tomorrow.

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,959
- About your transfer request for ScofieId.
- More specificaIIy, why you denied it.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,636
Look, Mr KeIIerman, do I come to your house
and teII you where to put your furniture?

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,794
- We're just asking for professionaI courtesy.
- A federaI courtesy in a state penitentiary.

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,156
Most peopIe wouId be happy
to have a body taken off their hands.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,596
These men are my responsibiIity.
From the minute they waIk in

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,275
to the time they've paid their debt to society,
I'm responsibIe.

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,033
UnIess he's done something
I don't know about,

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,635
he is gonna stay here at Fox River
under my watch.

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,508
Mr Pope, in our Iine of work,
just about everyone has done something

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,672
that someone doesn't know about.

33
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,593
- What's this?
- Right now, just a piece of history.

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,593
Whether it becomes a current event,
now, that's up to you.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,638
My wife aIready knows about ToIedo.

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,029
Does she reaIIy?

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,714
You're a smart man, Warden.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,713
I'm sure you can find a reason
ScofieId's presence is no Ionger required

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,473
at this particuIar correctionaI faciIity.

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,633
I need some more PVC here, boss.

41
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,556
- Boss?
- Sure thing, Burrows.

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,235
I don't wanna check for spIinters.
I want every piece accounted for.

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,436
Sure.

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,353
I got a ripped fertiIizer bag inside.

45
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,232
Hey, you!

46
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,436
You!

47
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,231
Get in there and cIean it up before this whoIe
pIace starts smeIIing Iike San Juan.

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,268
(mutters to himself)

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,957
OK, he's on his way. Do you mind teIIing me
what this is aII about?

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,878
These are the guys we're breaking out with.

51
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,794
I don't think so, fish.
That was not our agreement.

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,598
I'm not gonna work with this crazy rhino.

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,150
- Keep pushing it, John.
- Yeah, I keep pushing it, you know. Huh?

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,276
What's your deaI, man?

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,511
Touch my brother again and I'II show you.

56
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,279
Brother? Your brother?

57
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,878
We've got a few minutes. Are we gonna spend
'em spitting on each other or taIk business?

58
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,111
The reason we're aII here today
is we have a decision to make.

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,475
EngIish, Fitz, or Percy.

60
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,759
If we're gonna puII this off,
we need to take one of them out.

61
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,354
And you want us to teII you which one?

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,557
I just want you to heIp me get to them.
I'II take it from there.

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,870
- You're crazy.
- AII I need is five minutes.

64
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,714
- You won't get five seconds.
- I thought you had everything worked out.

65
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,476
We're not breaking out of a Jamba Juice.
It's gonna take more than digging a few hoIes.

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,553
There are eyes, ears, dots that couIdn't be
connected from the outside.

67
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,758
- And EngIish, Fitz or Percy?
- One of those dots.

68
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,519
And how exactIy
are you supposed to puII this off?

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,672
With a IittIe heIp from my friends.

70
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,309
Sucre, hoId up. ScofieId, you've got company.

71
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,276
Why do I get the feeIing that there's more
to you than meets the eye, ScofieId?

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,828
Anything you wanna teII me?

73
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,318
Some other reason you're in here
besides hoIding up a bank?

74
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,914
- You're being transferred.
- What?

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,468
We're moving you over to StatesviIIe.

76
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,832
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can. I'm the boss here.

77
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,037
This is my house.

78
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,156
- Three weeks.
- What for?

79
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,279
LincoIn Burrows.
He's being executed in three weeks.

80
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,318
I'm aware of that. What's that to you?

81
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,789
He's my brother.

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,073
When I knew I was being sent to prison,
my attorney petitioned the DOC.

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,197
- So you couId be near him.
- That's right.

84
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,478
Don't take that away from me.

85
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,755
Not untiI it's over.

86
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,238
I'm not the one behind the transfer.

87
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,517
You're up against much bigger fish than me.

88
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,035
I'II arrange for you to say goodbye.
You ship out tomorrow.

89
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,034
(faint organ music)

90
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,118
I'm going into the waIIs,
see if I can access the roof.

91
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,714
Were you gonna teII me about the transfer?

92
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,110
- I'm taking care of it.
- You're taking care of it?

93
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,475
Sounds to me Iike you're reaching.

94
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,393
Maybe. A IittIe.

95
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,596
A IittIe.

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,949
I'd made my peace, then you give me the one
thing a man in my situation shouIdn't have.

97
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,555
- Hope. And now that's gonna be taken away.
- Don't do this, Linc.

98
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,269
I got three weeks.
What do you want me to do?

99
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,559
(boy) Come on, MichaeI.
What do you want me to do?

100
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,632
- Bring her back.
- You know I can't do that.

101
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,990
But, Iook, there's some stuff that I can do.

102
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,231
It's not gonna be the same,
but we're gonna figure it out.

103
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,995
And no matter what,
it's stiII gonna be me and you.

104
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,670
OK, but what if something happens to you?

105
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,074
You just have a IittIe faith.

106
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
Just have a IittIe faith.

107
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,313
(Nick) If we beIieve LincoIn, this tape is a Iie.

108
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,631
- It has to be.
- But you saw it. It's aII there.

109
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,554
But maybe what we're Iooking for
is what's not there.

110
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,919
- OK. Steadman. See, what's he Iooking at?
- A car? A pedestrian?

111
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,151
(Nick) His eye Iine is high.
He's Iooking into the camera.

112
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,310
He might as weII be saying ''cheese''.

113
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,397
- Now he just sits there.
- For 10, 15 seconds, as if he was...

114
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,517
- Waiting for someone.
- Right.

115
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,836
There. That's a nine miIIimetre.
ShouIdn't there be a kick?

116
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,754
- LincoIn's pretty strong.
- Yeah, but strong enough to bury a recoiI?

117
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,355
Now, you shoot someone,
supposedIy for revenge.

118
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,638
Do you take the time to go in and hit
the gIove box? Or get the heII out of there?

119
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,157
Feds said he was trying
to make it Iook Iike a robbery.

120
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,869
Look. Look at LincoIn's angIe
as he Ieaves the frame.

121
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,279
Mm.

122
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,920
He waIks away from the car.

123
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,313
Now, this guy, who convenientIy hides his
face from the camera, comes back in. Why?

124
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,236
To expIain the bIoody pants they'd aIready
pIanted in his apartment. Nick, this is great.

125
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,629
- Who shaII we go to?
- Nobody. Yet.

126
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,157
To the unbiased eye, we're backing a horse
that died in the gate. A Iot of conjecture.

127
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,993
We don't have anything.
We need some evidence.

128
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,355
Look, if LincoIn didn't fire this gun,

129
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,637
somebody with serious skiIIs
worked on this to prove he did.

130
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,188
Fine, but how do we prove that?

131
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,152
- I know a guy.
- You know a guy?

132
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,196
Yeah, I know a guy.

133
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,149
Thanks.

134
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,119
We need to have a powwow. There's been taIk
about you packing your bags.

135
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,751
Don't beIieve everything you hear.
I'm not going anywhere.

136
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,079
I have a reaIIy hard time trusting you, fish.

137
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,197
The important thing
is that we stay on scheduIe.

138
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,590
- Yeah? EngIish, Fitz and Percy?
- EngIish, Fitz or Percy.

139
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,796
Wanna know which one we shouId take out?

140
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,714
With aII due respect, I don't need opinions.
I need answers.

141
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,679
The warden Ieaves at five tonight,
so by five after five we need that key.

142
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,638
And how is this key
gonna give you the answers?

143
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,553
I'II worry about that.
Worry about getting the key.

144
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,235
Hey. This key better be worth it.

145
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,834
Understand?

146
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,078
Afternoon, Mr ScofieId.

147
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,993
I need to know
if there's a way to bIock a transfer.

148
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,073
- There's about 50 ways.
- AII right. I'II take the quickest.

149
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,073
You fiIe a motion for what they caII
an interIocutory injunction.

150
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,833
- How Iong does that take?
- How fast can you write?

151
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,913
A man can cIaim aImost anything
vioIates his constitutionaI rights.

152
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,437
EnvironmentaI issues, aIIergies,
reIigious requirements - take your pick.

153
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,035
- What if they don't buy it?
- They're required to hear your motion.

154
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,350
TiII they do, you can't be transferred.

155
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,877
HeII, they've been trying to move
my tired, grey behind for ten years.

156
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,396
God bIess the American IegaI system.

157
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,119
Why do you want to stay in here so badIy?

158
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,875
There's someone here
I can't bear to Ieave behind.

159
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,192
I guess that means
we've got something in common.

160
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,398
- The state's requiring a physicaI for Burrows.
- You heard the news?

161
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,516
- No, what?
- They're brothers.

162
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,512
- Who?
- Burrows and ScofieId.

163
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,749
MichaeI ScofieId?

164
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,879
Heard it from one of the COs over in Gen Pop.
He didn't say anything about it?

165
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,154
No.

166
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,110
It must be hard to be so cIose to your brother
and not be abIe to do anything to heIp him.

167
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,109
- What's this?
- A IittIe bathroom reading.

168
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,035
- WestmoreIand again?
- ScofieId. He's bIocking his transfer.

169
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,399
Even if the motion is denied,
it's gonna take 30 days to process.

170
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,153
And that means...

171
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,278
AII right, I'm going in.
I'm gonna need your heIp.

172
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,079
In in? Now? I thought you were waiting tiII...

173
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,119
I need to make sure I know how I'm getting
up there so when the time comes...

174
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,919
In case you didn't notice, the Iights are aII on.

175
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,471
You've got a Iive studio audience, fish.
How are you gonna get around that?

176
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,028
Don't we have some Iaundry to do?

177
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,670
Just to be cIear,

178
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,990
I ain't touching your drawers.

179
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,793
(guard #1) Eyes straight ahead.

180
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,155
- Keep it moving.
- (guard #2) Eyes front.

181
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,028
- (guard #1) Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
- Him.

182
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,280
(guard #1) Get him up. Hit him.

183
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,111
(guard #2) Stay down.

184
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,358
Come on.

185
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,198
Come on.

186
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,749
Fish. I can't deaI with that.

187
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,117
Fish. Come on.

188
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,997
Yo, fish. Fish, you're taking too Iong, bro.

189
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,109
This ain't gonna fIy. The Ricans, we've got
geneticaIIy higher bIood pressure, you know?

190
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,509
My cousin, he died from too much stress.

191
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,670
You said he was moving in on your girI.

192
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,672
My other cousin,
but thanks for bringing that up.

193
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,754
Look, the good news is I can get to the roof.

194
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,274
- So what happens now?
- Now?

195
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,920
It's aII about timing.

196
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,791
(watch beeps)

197
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,830
- It's a top-doIIarjob. You know who did it?
- No. Do you?

198
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,798
PeopIe who do this kind of work
are ghosts, man.

199
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,519
The guy behind the guy behind the guy,
you know?

200
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,434
Can you see anything that proves
the tape might have been doctored?

201
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,795
The thing's cIean. No footprints.

202
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,236
UsuaIIy, you peeI the video back,
anything bogus comes off.

203
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,959
Now you see it, now you don't.
But not this one.

204
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,271
It's Iaced. Ingrained.

205
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,114
Whoa, whoa.

206
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,590
- You see something?
- The probIem with eyes is they pIay tricks.

207
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,797
But your ears - ears don't Iie.

208
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,030
Here's the audio track from the tape.

209
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,832
- Sounds pretty true?
- Yeah.

210
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,708
But noise is aIive.
See, it doesn'tjust die Iike that.

211
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,439
Stripped down,
those IeveIs shouId be dancing.

212
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,877
A room that size wouId give you
a bIam, bIam, bIam, bIam, you know.

213
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,428
Off each waII, a spIit second after the other.

214
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,876
On yours,
the reverb's bouncing at the same time.

215
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,157
- What does that mean?
- The sound of a gunshot.

216
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,038
It wasn't recorded in that room.

217
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,590
- WouId you testify to that?
- Oh, uh, I don't know.

218
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,752
The tape's a dupe.
For aII I know, you guys tampered with it.

219
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:30,029
Look, if you want me to testify in court, I'm
gonna need to get my hands on the originaI.

220
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,469
- (pope) How are those aIIergies?
- Excuse me?

221
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,872
- (pope) In your motion, you cited chronic...
- Sinusitis.

222
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,635
It's not an aIIergy, actuaIIy.
It's a bacteriaI infection.

223
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,350
The moist air from the river aIong
the east waII heIps keep me, you know...

224
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,158
cIear.

225
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,119
I'm impressed. Not even a week here
and you're working it Iike an oId con.

226
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,749
You've got one up on me.
You know why I needed to fiIe those motions,

227
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,071
but I have no idea
why you needed to transfer me.

228
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,835
Traffic controI, ScofieId.
That's aII. Traffic controI.

229
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,514
It's coming up on five o'cIock. CaII it a day.

230
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,795
- I don't think I can do that.
- Why not?

231
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,917
If I Iet go of this support,
the whoIe thing's coming down.

232
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,560
See, the Taj was designed using axiaI force -

233
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,269
a series of internaI forces
aIong the IongitudinaI axis.

234
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,672
- Yeah. How much Ionger?
- Depends on how Iong it takes to dry.

235
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,309
If you need me to Ieave,
I can show your secretary how to hoId it.

236
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,755
You can stay. There'II be a guard outside.

237
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,515
Just check in with Becky
and she'II have somebody escort you back.

238
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,512
- AII right.
- And, ScofieId.

239
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,592
I wanna thank you for showing up today.
I wouId've understood it if you didn't.

240
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,989
- We had a deaI.
- Right.

241
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,231
StiII, thanks. My wife is gonna Iove it.

242
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,470
You're weIcome.

243
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,519
- (man) See you tomorrow, sir.
- (woman) Good night, Warden.

244
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,670
(door closes)

245
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,389
We'd just happen to be two peopIe
who happen to know each other,

246
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,996
who happen to show up at the same movie
theatre at what happens to be the same time.

247
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,594
(woman laughs)

248
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,511
You know, from this angIe, you Iook
just as good as you did when we first met.

249
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,876
- How about from this one?
- Even better.

250
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,037
- Oh.
- Uh-uh. Those are for your guests.

251
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,111
- Guests?
- Your associates.

252
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,875
They said you had a meeting.
They're in the den.

253
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,470
Evening, Warden.

254
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,874
There's nothing I can do. I'm obIigated to fiIe
every motion so a hearing can be scheduIed.

255
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,273
- And how Iong does that take?
- A month, maybe two. It's out of my hands.

256
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,715
Why do I feeI you're not disappointed?

257
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,076
May I ask you a question, Warden?

258
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,310
More of an observation, reaIIy.

259
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,554
I was Iooking at the morgue photos
from that boy back in ToIedo - WiII CIayton -

260
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,191
and, my Lord,
if he wasn't the spitting image of his daddy.

261
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,829
The appIe feII reaI far from the tree
with that one, didn't it?

262
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,595
It feII off the tree, feII aII over the pavement.

263
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,750
You son of a bitch.

264
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,513
Your wife gave you a pass on the affair,

265
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,319
but that's aII the forgiveness she's got Ieft.

266
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,358
EspeciaIIy when it comes to
an iIIegitimate chiId.

267
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,954
What happened with young WiII, Warden?

268
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,479
- Get out of my house.
- Lose ScofieId's paperwork.

269
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,915
- Are you staying for dinner?
- Thanks, but I think we're on our way.

270
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,434
Judy, it was a reaI pIeasure.

271
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,150
Thank you. And thatjust may have been
the best iced tea I've ever had.

272
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,710
Warden, better do everything you can
to hoId on to this one.

273
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,360
- I wiII.
- Good.

274
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,199
- Is everything aII right?
- Oh, yeah. Just fine. I, uh...

275
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,592
I just have a IittIe unfinished work
to take care of. I'II be right in.

276
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,477
OK.

277
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,835
He's aII cIear.

278
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,878
- Evening, LincoIn.
- Doctor.

279
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,157
I'm supposed to give you
a physicaI this evening.

280
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,119
Let me apoIogise for the dose of irony
we're about to participate in.

281
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,873
It's aII right. Just doing yourjob.

282
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,234
Yeah, weII...

283
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,997
Letting them know you're heaIthy enough to
execute is not why I went to medicaI schooI.

284
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,594
- I apoIogise.
- It's OK.

285
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,508
AII right.

286
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,512
I'm gonna need
a famiIy medicaI history from you.

287
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,628
Any aiIments or conditions
that are hereditary. Let's start with your mom.

288
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,996
- Cancer. Liver.
- OK. Father?

289
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,355
SpIit when I was young.

290
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,510
SibIings.

291
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,194
Anyone besides MichaeI?

292
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,596
Fox River's a smaII town, LincoIn.

293
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,231
PeopIe around here don't have
a whoIe Iot to do besides time and taIk.

294
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,071
Are you cIose?

295
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,198
(Linc) We were.

296
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,796
- (Sara) How about now?
- Huh?

297
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,189
How about now?

298
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,233
(Linc) He's been abandoned his whole life.

299
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,869
Dad, Mom - she died young -

300
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,554
and now me.

301
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,511
Think that's why he's here?

302
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,434
Cos your death wouId feeI Iike
it's happening again

303
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,069
(Linc) l abandoned him a long time ago.
That's why he's here.

304
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,636
- (watch beeps)
- (buzzer)

305
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,790
(guard) Gates cIosing.

306
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,072
- It's time.
- Time?

307
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,914
Oh, God. Here we go again.
Count's in 15 minutes. What are you doing?

308
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,437
- Trust me. The Iess you know, the better.
- The Iess I know? You got me in the dark.

309
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,988
That's exactIy where you wanna be.

310
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,757
(man) Don't normaIIy find you here
at this hour.

311
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,353
Are you seeking his forgiveness? Or advice?

312
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,718
I reaIIy don't know any more, Ben.

313
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,430
AII I know is my son WiII
was my responsibiIity.

314
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,310
- If I'd stayed in his Iife, I couId've saved it.
- His death was an accident, Henry.

315
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,351
He was a criminaI,

316
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,797
and an addict, but he was onIy 18 years oId.

317
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,476
His mother made it cIear you couIdn't be
in his Iife if you weren't gonna be in hers.

318
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,109
When you chose to stay with Judy,
you understood that.

319
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,998
I not onIy understood it, I was gratefuI for it.

320
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,152
I toId myseIf I was respecting her wishes.

321
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,671
I cursed her under my breath
whiIe every day I thanked God

322
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,672
for aIIowing me to wash my hands of her.

323
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,830
Of ToIedo.

324
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,835
AII of it.

325
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,800
So I ran home,

326
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,394
to Judy,

327
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,948
and I buried the secret.

328
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,950
But I never got a chance to...

329
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,350
to bury my... my son.

330
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,997
What kind of a person does that, Ben?

331
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,518
Sacrifices somebody eIse's Iife
just to make their own Iife easier.

332
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,238
You can argue with me aII night. BeIieve me,
I haven't got anything better to do.

333
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,553
But it won't change the fact that I can't
just hand out originaI copies of evidence.

334
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,191
- If you couId just take a Iook...
- I don't care. I can't give it to you.

335
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,159
What if we brought somebody here?
Your supervisor couId monitor them.

336
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,232
He'd strip down and swear
on a stack of BibIes. Whatever.

337
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,278
Wait. What did you say
the docket number was?

338
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,194
It's 296 SPE.

339
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,352
- What's wrong?
- Come with me.

340
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,995
Last night a pipe burst upstairs,
fIooded the pIace.

341
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,393
FiIes from over 100 cases -
pretty much Iost aII of them, incIuding yours.

342
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,756
- Just this room?
- Some kind of freak accident.

343
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,431
(buzzer)

344
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,559
(whistle)

345
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,950
- (guard) Count 'em.
- (Bellick) CaIIahan, Knight.

346
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,196
MaIinowski, PohIen.

347
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,669
(watch beeps)

348
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,993
Chance, Graziano.

349
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,719
ScofieId, Sucre.

350
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,349
ScofieId, get the heII out here.

351
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,116
We got a runner.

352
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,556
(alarm)

353
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,514
(pA) Lockdown.

354
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,955
Lockdown!

355
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,553
(inmates shout)

356
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,833
AII right. For the Iast time, pi¨¾ata.

357
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,959
Where the heII's ScofieId?
He's gone, you're gone. You hear me?

358
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,998
(radio) Call it off, Captain.
l got Scofeld right here.

359
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,550
- Where?
- (radio) ln the warden's office.

360
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,790
Are you Iooking at him?

361
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,749
Stop trying to nail the secretary
and check the damn office.

362
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,919
Captain, he's gone.

363
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,071
(alarm continues and dogs bark)

364
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,835
- The man can'tjust vanish.
- I know, sir.

365
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,276
- He never checked out? The rear door?
- StiII Iocked. I checked.

366
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,635
How the heII did he...?

367
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,518
- What's going on?
- You're in the warden's office.

368
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,149
I couId kiII you and the paperwork
wouIdn't need more than a date.

369
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,791
- TeII me, what were you doing in here?
- AII right, Deputy. That's enough.

370
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,990
The work wasn't dry.
You said to stay untiI it was.

371
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,911
- You were in here?
- Yes, sir.

372
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,117
- It's true. I never saw him Ieave.
- I must not have seen him.

373
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,352
This is ridicuIous. This prisoner
was out of his ceII. He missed the count.

374
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,590
(pope) I understand, Deputy.

375
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,070
The thing is,
Mr ScofieId is not our probIem any more.

376
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,516
There was an error in his paperwork.
He's gonna be transferred.

377
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,716
That's not possibIe.

378
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,314
Escort the prisoner back to his ceII.

379
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,913
Warden, aII I need is three weeks.

380
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,353
- Get off me!
- Come on!

381
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,318
Henry, pIease. I just need a IittIe time.

382
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,789
Just give me the time.

383
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,918
Any chance you want to write this off
as a coincidence?

384
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,319
Me neither.

385
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,109
How couId they know we were coming?
Three hours ago, we didn't know.

386
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,909
- We're pissing someone off.
- You say that Iike it's a good thing.

387
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,869
PeopIe start breaking the Iaw,
you know you're getting warm.

388
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,515
We stiII have our copy of the tape, so maybe...

389
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,349
- Nick.
- Stay here.

390
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,956
Whoever it was has gone.
Does it Iook Iike they got anything?

391
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,315
No.

392
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,628
Everything's exactIy the way I Ieft it.

393
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,828
What? What?

394
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,668
- What?
- The tape. It's gone.

395
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,398
- Are you sure?
- How?

396
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,835
- Think this through.
- How couId they know?

397
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,070
- Wait. Does anyone eIse have a key?
- No.

398
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,994
- Are you sure this is where you put it?
- You were here. I was taIking to you.

399
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,868
I waIked toward the cabinet, and I said...

400
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,991
What?

401
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,275
Veronica, are you OK?

402
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,471
Veronica.

403
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,400
- (buzzer)
- (Bellick) Open up!

404
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,268
Breakfast, gentIemen. Let's move it.

405
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,559
Sucre, Iet's go. ScofieId, wait here.
I'm sure your ride'II be aIong any minute now.

406
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,754
This can't be it.

407
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,910
It can't end Iike this.

408
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,150
(Bellick) Let's move it.

409
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,073
- (Michael) Fitz.
- What?

410
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,310
We were gonna take Fitz out.

411
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,880
It was as cIear as day.

412
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,912
And the cops? How Iong did it take them
to respond? You got aII the timing down?

413
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,274
Think we wouId've made it?

414
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,236
Sucre, now.

415
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,958
(# ''Orange Sky'' by Alexi Murdoch)

Don't forget to buckIe up.

428
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,712

- (guard) He's being transferred.

429
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,475
No, there must be some mistake.
This man fiIed a motion yesterday.

430
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,870
He has a medicaI condition
which precIudes transfer.

431
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,996
Sinusitis, right?

432
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,435
Sinusitis.

433
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,992
Take the prisoner back to his ceII. But yank
his rec time. He missed count Iast night.

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,838
You're home earIy. Everything OK?

Yeah. Yeah, it is.

- (woman) Yes?

441
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,629
- (Kellerman) The transfer did not go through.
- (woman) Disappointing.

442
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,554
- (Kellerman) We can refle, but...
