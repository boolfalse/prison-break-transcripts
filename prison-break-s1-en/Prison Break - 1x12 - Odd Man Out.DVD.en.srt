1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,798
previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,236
(Sucre) What you're doing in the infirmary,
what's it gotta do with here?

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,550
Four days from now,
on the night of the escape,

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,359
we'II have 18 minutes
to get the bars off the window

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,591
and for aII seven of us
to get across the wire and over the waII.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,591
- Is that doabIe?
- Of course.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,636
Maricruz, what the heII is going on?

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,553
Yeah, weII, Hector says
you can serve your fuII sentence.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,278
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,715
She's not gonna be
coming around here any more.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,155
- It's ajoke, right?
- She's with me now.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,949
I just need to know
what MichaeI ScofieId wanted from you

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,349
in exchange for the green card.

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,192
(Nika) Why wouId you need a credit card?

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,273
If I'd known how this was gonna turn out,
I'd have gotten some crap job with the Feds.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,113
Keep taIking Iike that,
I'm gonna put a buIIet in your head.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,589
I need to get out whiIe I stiII got my Iife.

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,033
Daddy! Daddy!

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,190
Things have changed. I want in.

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,315
(knocking)

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,119
- So?
- We've got too many peopIe.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,074
I've done the math. One of 'em has to go.

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,356
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Oh, it's not a probIem.

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,634
Mm.

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,429
- Impressive r¨¦sum¨¦.
- Thank you.

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,432
TeII me why you chose to pursue
a career in engineering.

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,397
WeII, um...

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,916
I've aIways been interested in structure.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,195
Geometry.

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,511
How things fit together.

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,596
How an object that performs a function
can aIso be a work of art.

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,754
What about the future?
Where do you see yourseIf in five years?

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,271
One suit, bIack.

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,151
(button falls)

35
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,628
That baby boy aII growed up yet?

36
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,836
(laughs)

37
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,629
Oh, he's gonna raise heII the next few years.

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,915
Take after his momma.

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,076
Yeah, you know. Same oId same up here.

40
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,035
But, uh...

41
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,673
things are getting pretty tense.

42
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,595
Like they're fixing to, uh... coIIide.
You know what I mean, Jimmy?

43
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,468
There's a potentiaI situation.

44
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,436
I found our access to the infirmary.

45
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,398
- I'm gonna need time to make it work.
- How much time?

46
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,474
Enough for me to find my way up a 20ft
verticaI drainpipe without using a Iadder.

47
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,189
I'II probabIy need to skip PI tomorrow
if I wanna get this thing done.

48
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,274
You can'tjust skip it. It ain't cIass.
What if one of the buIIs decides to drop in?

49
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,396
I don't have a choice, do I?

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,155
Once we get through the pipe
beIow the guards' room it'II be easier.

51
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,789
I can come and go without using the door,
and with WestmoreIand as Iookout,

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,075
we'II have one more man for digging.

53
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,119
He's a probIem. AII seven of us
can't break over that waII in 18 minutes.

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,395
You said it yourseIf. It's impossibIe.

55
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,951
- Listen, man, one of us has gotta take a hike.
- (Michael) I know.

56
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,873
Mind if I share that with the rest of the cIass?

57
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,229
ApparentIy, coIIege boy here did the math.

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,595
Figured out that we got too many cIowns
in the car. So one of us is in here digging,

59
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,036
- but his seat ain't guaranteed.
- How's this your probIem?

60
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,033
- He doesn't know what he's taIking about.
- I won't dig if I'm not gonna go.

61
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,399
- We need to decide who gets cut.
- I think we aII can agree who that shouId be.

62
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,829
Pardon me for interrupting,

63
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,195
but, uh...

64
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,988
what's that smeII?

65
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,717
It smeIIs a IittIe Iike conspiracy.

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,110
- We need to get back to work.
- I have an announcement to make.

67
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,749
I've been growing Ieery of the way
you aII taIk Iike I'm a Iesser man,

68
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,400
so I bought an insurance poIicy.

69
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,473
I caIIed up my guy on the outside
and I toId him about our pIan,

70
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,757
and I toId him in aII IikeIihood
I'II be seeing him next week.

71
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,956
But...

72
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,999
if he don't hear from me five minutes
before the escape and 20 minutes after,

73
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,676
I toId him to caII up the warden,
bIow the whistIe on the whoIe thing.

74
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,070
So if y'aII got ideas about getting rid of me,

75
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,194
I suggest you make other pIans.

76
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,598
Son of a bitch has got
a countermove for everything.

77
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,671
Not for this.

78
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,076
Odd men out. Me and you.

79
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,312
- What do you mean?
- Look who you're waIking with right now.

80
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,915
You shouId be up there,
caIIing the shots with the rest of the suits.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,592
Yeah? So?

82
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,398
So.

83
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,199
ScofieId is onIy here for one reason.

84
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,759
His brother.

85
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,517
And he onIy needs two things. The oId man's
money, and the mob boss's pIane.

86
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,958
He don't need you. You just happened
to be in the same ceII when he got here.

87
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,998
- You and the toiIet.
- I've done a Iot of work on this thing.

88
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,310
ExactIy. Me too.

89
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,630
We're just the Iabourers on this thing, man.

90
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,032
The night that fish goes into that hoIe,
you think he wants aII that extra baggage?

91
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,156
Cos that's aII we are.

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,198
I don't know about you, but I'm going.

93
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,112
How much does he teII you, anyways?

94
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,351
Or does he keep it aII to himseIf?

95
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,274
Yeah, he probabIy teIIs you
the Iess you know the better, right?

96
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,511
You don't know what you're taIking about.
He teIIs me everything.

97
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,434
If he teIIs you everything,
then you don't need him.

98
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,390
Now, we can go by ourseIves. Me and you.

99
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,554
Or, you know, you can wait, and see if
ScofieId reaIIy wants to carry a heavy weight.

100
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,834
It's up to you, papi.

101
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,194
Yo. I'm stiII waiting.

102
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,554
What for?

103
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,949
I swiped you that watch, man.
Where's my PI?

104
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,508
- That's not gonna happen.
- You promised.

105
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,354
I said I'd think about it.
Maybe somewhere down the road.

106
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,238
Yeah, I ain't gonna hoId my breath.

107
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,755
- (LJ) What do you want me to do?
- Get somebody.

108
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,638
No, no, they see a buIIet,
they're gonna caII the cops.

109
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,188
We don't have a choice!
I'm not gonna Iet you die.

110
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,395
- Find it.
- What?

111
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,471
The buIIet. Just find it and dig it out.

112
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,357
- I can't.
- Do it!

113
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,798
(door opens)

114
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,348
(Bellick) Where's ScofieId?

115
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,877
There you are.

116
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,714
Just Iooked for you in your ceII.
CouIdn't find you anypIace.

117
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,112
CouIdn't find your credit card either.
You know the one I'm taIking about.

118
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,839
The one your whore wife
trunked in the other day.

119
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,718
She toId me aII about it.

120
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,752
Maybe ''whore'' is too strong.
What do you caII a girI

121
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,469
who married a feIon
to get into the United States?

122
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,109
Why'd she have to come here, anyway?
No strip cIubs in Whazitstan?

123
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,191
- (Sara) Officer BeIIick...
- Captain.

124
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,556
Fine. Do you mind conducting
your inquisitions on your own time?

125
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,154
- I've a scheduIe to maintain.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

126
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,789
I was just asking Mr ScofieId
about the contraband

127
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,475
he had his stripper wife
trunk in the other day.

128
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,394
But you go ahead.
Yourjob's more important.

129
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,668
He's had it out for me since the day I got here.

130
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,274
- HoId stiII, pIease.
- Sorry.

131
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,750
I onIy married her
so she couId get her green card.

132
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,230
I saw you coming out of the conjugaI room.

133
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,194
That's just business.

134
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,669
You don't have to expIain it to me, MichaeI.

135
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,671
I know.

136
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,598
But I want to.

137
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,072
DB. Oh, is that who you is now?
I thought you was just a cowboy.

138
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,232
- Take a coupIe of steps back, boy.
- What I can't understand

139
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,675
is why somebody Iike you
wants to get out anyway.

140
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,799
How you gonna survive, huh?
The worId's aII different now. It's scary.

141
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,112
They got computer phones, boobies made
of siIicone. You wouIdn't know what to do.

142
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,159
- I don't have to justify myseIf to you.
- Oh, you're gonna have to.

143
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,109
Them oId bones is gonna be dragging us
down. Maybe I'II just snap a few right now...

144
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,632
- Take your best shot.
- Hey, break it up down there!

145
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,119
Bow out, cowboy.
I'm not gonna warn you no more.

146
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,517
(Lincoln) What's up?

147
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,232
Records from the phone in the yard.
James BagweII Iives down in Gary.

148
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,675
- T-Bag's insurance poIicy?
- Yeah.

149
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,550
My guy's gonna Iock him up in a moving van
for a coupIe of days untiI we're in the cIear.

150
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,631
- Moving van?
- Yeah.

151
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,638
Don't worry. He can breathe, and aII.
We do it aII the time.

152
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,991
What about T-Bag?

153
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,799
He's no Ionger a threat. Trust me.

154
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,233
You James BagweII? Got a deIivery for you.

155
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,191
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

156
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,114
- You aII right?
- Yeah.

157
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,159
- (man) Ma'am?
- Yes?

158
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,595
- Can I speak with you, pIease?
- Of course.

159
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,399
You stay here, OK?
Is he gonna be OK?

160
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,479
(doctor) We don't know yet. I was gonna caII
the poIice, I wanted to speak with you first.

161
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,028
His wound is obviousIy
the product of a gunshot.

162
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,910
You need to be honest with me.
What was he doing when he got shot?

163
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,195
He was in the garage, underneath his car.

164
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,633
He's in surgery right now.

165
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,554
The bIood Ioss has caused his muscIe tissue
to suffer from a Iack of oxygen.

166
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,915
He's sustained damage to his shouIder.

167
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,719
With a buIIet there's
an increased risk of infection.

168
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,395
So he has to be admitted.
Is there anyone you shouId caII? FamiIy?

169
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,074
No. It's just me.

170
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,311
AII right. WeII, I'II Iet you know
as soon as he's in recovery.

171
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,231
Thank you.

172
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,678
(phone rings)

173
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,469
Yeah?

174
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,994
- Are you there yet?
- Almost.

175
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,279
Remember. Be patient, foIIow his Iead.
We want the trifecta today.

176
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,631
Yeah, I'm on it.

177
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,552
- It's me.
- (man) Yeah, l got bad news.

178
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,834
Yeah? Like what?

179
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,994
The job you ordered went bad.
The guy was paranoid, he had a gun.

180
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,550
- One thing led to another.
- What? He's dead?

181
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,359
Yeah. And unfortunateIy...

182
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,432
there was a kid there.

183
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,035
What are you... What are you taIking about?
You kiIIed a kid?

184
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,429
lt was unintentional.

185
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,794
It's a kid, man.

186
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,791
l know. l'm sorry.

187
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,155
SOB used him as a shieId.

188
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,791
- Boy or a girI?
- I don't know. A boy.

189
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,869
How old?

190
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,916
Four, maybe five.

191
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,228
- Who's here to see me?
- HeII if I know. Some Iady.

192
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,075
Baby.

193
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,758
Hi.

194
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,717
You Iook so beautifuI.

195
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,196
I came here cos I have to teII you something.

196
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,952
What?

197
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,315
I'm pregnant, Fernando.

198
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,515
Pregnant?

199
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,436
With your baby.

200
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,152
I'm gonna have your son.

201
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,319
You... You're gonna... We...

202
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,595
We're gonna have a baby?

203
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,955
Oye, papi, you hear that?
I'm gonna be a dad!

204
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,713
- I'm not finished.
- What, mami? What?

205
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,553
OK. Hector, he asked me to marry him.

206
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,200
- What?
- Look, it's crazy, I know.

207
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,431
TeII him no. TeII him you're having my son.
We'II be a famiIy.

208
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,431
Fernando, Iook.

209
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,277
My mom, she says that having a baby
is the hardestjob in the whoIe worId.

210
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,874
And it's even harder if I do this by myseIf.

211
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,119
And aII I know is, I'm reaIIy scared.
I'm reaIIy scared to do this aIone.

212
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,794
- You won't have to.
- WeII, I haven't toId him no yet.

213
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,032
Wait, wait.
You're not actuaIIy considering this?

214
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,079
Oh, baby. I don't know. I don't know.

215
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,879
My God, baby,
you gotta stop Iistening to these peopIe.

216
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,155
They're poisoning your brain.

217
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,358
Your hormone things are out of whack.
You're not thinking straight.

218
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,591
This is our chiId we're taIking about.

219
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,273
I want you to Iisten to me.

220
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,478
I want you to wait. I'm gonna be out.
Sooner than you think.

221
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,151
- You keep on teIIing me that.
- (buzzer)

222
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,518
AII right. Visiting time is up. Let's go.

223
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,792
TeII me you're gonna wait.

224
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,598
Hands off, Sucre.

225
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,673
You're aII I got Ieft in the worId, baby.
PIease.

226
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,237
I Iove you.

227
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,391
But you'II Iearn to Iove again, right?

228
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,349
TeII me you're gonna teII him no, honey.

229
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,431
I don't know.

230
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,674
I don't know anything any more.

231
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,553
Sucre. Come on.

232
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,596
The kid's here.

233
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,639
(Kellerman) perfect.
Follow him back to the lawyers, call me back.

234
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,837
- Where you going?
- I'II be back in ten minutes.

235
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,948
- What do you have to do?
- It's compIicated. I can't expIain.

236
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,713
But if it works, you'II see soon enough.

237
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,271
I want to go with you. I want to see now.

238
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,909
Someone has to stay here. I need a Iookout.

239
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,036
- I'm aIways on Iookout.
- You're my ceII mate.

240
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,793
Who eIse is gonna do it?

241
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,077
I'II be back in ten minutes. OK?

242
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,198
OK.

243
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,671
We're aII Iined up for tomorrow.
Where do you want him?

244
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,115
John. Tomorrow.
Where do you want T-Bag?

245
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,395
- In the shop or in the shed?
- Shh.

246
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,711
I don't care. You decide.

247
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,391
(gunshot)

248
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,830
Thank God.

249
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,911
Are you OK?

250
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,630
Yeah. I'm OK.
She didn't do anything.

251
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,111
She didn't deserve it.

252
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,191
I know.

253
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,673
- Here you go, man.
- Yeah.

254
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,036
These were seriousIy hard to get.
What you need 'em for, anyway?

255
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,111
None of your business.

256
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:29,192
Thank you for waiting, Theodore.
I don't mean to deny your time in the yard.

257
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,510
What's this aII about?

258
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,272
I, uh...

259
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,591
I'm afraid I have some terribIe news.

260
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,479
Your cousin, James,
was shot and kiIIed in his home yesterday.

261
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,030
His son, James Junior, was kiIIed as weII.

262
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,111
I'm very, very sorry.

263
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,118
What does it mean?

264
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,998
Am I chosen?

265
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,310
Or what?

266
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,951
Often, the Lord appears when
you're in particuIar need of forgiveness.

267
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,510
Maybe that's what's happening right now.

268
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,275
John, it's never too Iate.

269
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,148
If you agree to accept Christ into your heart,
and turn from your sin,

270
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,518
he wiII forgive you, and save you in eternity.

271
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,077
Do you agree?

272
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,236
ReveIation, chapter three, verse 20.

273
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,238
''Jesus said,
'BehoId, I stand at the door and knock.'''

274
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:57,156
'''If any man hear my voice
and open the door, I wiII come in to him.'''

275
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,794
He got to the infirmary buiIding Iast night,
through the oId sewer pipe.

276
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,077
It's the same pipe
that runs under the guards' room.

277
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,151
That's aII I know.

278
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,077
(man) There's the IittIe thumbsucker
that swiped my watch.

279
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,879
- (Bellick) Who? Tweener?
- SoIid goId.

280
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,758
Took it off my arm.
It was a haIf hour before I noticed.

281
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,958
Whose was it in the first pIace?
I don't care if you stoIe it. You can teII me.

282
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,474
MichaeI ScofieId.

283
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,471
What are you Iooking at?

284
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,953
I'II be right around the corner.

285
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,430
- (guard) WestmoreIand.
- You scared me, boss.

286
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,758
Get back to work.

287
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,796
(coughs loudly)

288
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,551
(whistles)

289
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,198
AII right, Iet's go.

290
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,311
Move it, ScofieId.

291
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,356
''For me, I wouId caII upon God,
and the Lord shaII save me...''

292
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,750
''..cry aIoud, and he shaII hear my voice...''

293
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,911
''..he shaII hear my voice... hear my voice...''

294
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,468
''..he shaII hear my voice...''

295
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,951
''..hear my voice...''

296
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,711
He shaII hear my voice.

297
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,753
(Michael) What are you doing?

298
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,989
Nothing.

299
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,073
WeII, keep an eye on the tier for me,
wiII you?

300
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,469
When are we getting out of here, exactIy?

301
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,835
- I need to know the time.
- As soon as possibIe.

302
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,309
That's not a time.
You teII Abruzzi the time?

303
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,153
- He needs to know.
- Why does he need to know and I don't?

304
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,758
Because he's arranging the pIane.
Why the sudden curiosity?

305
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,838
Why wouId you want to be responsibIe
for potentiaIIy dangerous information?

306
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,356
The Iess you know, the better.
It's for your own good.

307
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,919
I have to go. I'II meet you in PI.

308
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,396
SteaIing from a guard.
You couId get thrown in the SHU for that.

309
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,994
Maybe even add a few years to your bit.

310
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,119
- I don't know what...
- No, don't deny it. I aIready know it's true.

311
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,839
Lucky for you, I got some puII around here.

312
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,313
I can make this sort of thing go away,
Iike it never even happened.

313
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,515
That's good.

314
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,431
Now...

315
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,473
I'm sure you've heard the word ''rat''.
I don't Iike it.

316
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,312
''Snitch'', neither.

317
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,836
Those sort of words aren't appropriate
for what I need from you.

318
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,229
What I need is a IittIe information.

319
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,074
Like when you're hanging out with ScofieId...

320
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,357
Just come back and teII me what he said.

321
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,795
I got an extra burger.

322
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,633
But, man, I'm fuII.

323
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,679
So what do you say, kiddo?
Want a cheeseburger?

324
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,919
Or you want to go to the SHU?

325
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,349
That's my boy.

326
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,198
Hey, honey, what are you doing here?
I thought you Ieft.

327
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,872
What's wrong?

328
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,439
I, um...

329
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,636
I been thinking.

330
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,349
- I think we need to make a change.
- What are you taIking about?

331
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,238
When we got married,
we thought about moving out west.

332
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,356
Yeah, we were 22.

333
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,830
WeII, maybe we shouId give it a shot.
It's not too Iate.

334
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,037
I don't understand. What brought this on?

335
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,395
It's just work.

336
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,278
I'm tired of being on the road
working for somebody eIse

337
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,070
whiIe you sit at home aII aIone night
after night. I want our Iives to be about us.

338
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,280
I do too. But there's so much to think about,
with the kids and the house.

339
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,352
We gotta go.

340
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,829
You're in troubIe, aren't you?

341
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,712
Oh.

342
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,756
Crowd has thinned out in here.

343
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,877
- How you doing, Sucre?
- AImost there. Switch me out.

344
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,951
You're up. Then WestmoreIand.

345
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,874
We gotta get through,
MichaeI's gonna be coming back this way.

346
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,069
(Sara) Katie, go ahead and bring that up.

347
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,754
(phone rings)

348
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,274
- HeIIo?
- (Hale) Veronica Donovan?

349
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,395
Who is this?

350
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,076
l... lt doesn't matter who l am.
Don't hang up.

351
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,709
I have information
that you may be interested in.

352
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,156
Information that wiII Iead
to the exoneration of LincoIn Burrows.

353
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,630
- What? What is it?
- l can't tell you that now.

354
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,998
Meet me tomorrow
at the HighIand Caf¨¦ on Kennedy Avenue.

355
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,671
This isn't a trap.
l will tell you everything you need to know.

356
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,751
HighIand Caf¨¦, eight pm.

357
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,355
AII right. That's enough.

358
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,516
- Leave us aIone.
- You sure?

359
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,909
Get out of here.

360
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,353
You don't have to do this.

361
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,476
You don't have to do this.

362
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,360
You don't have to do this.

363
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,476
You brought it on yourseIf.

364
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,633
I'm just an emissary
for aII the pain and suffering you caused.

365
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,598
AII the famiIies you ruined. AII the kids.

366
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,513
What about Jimmy?

367
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,910
He had nothing to do with this.
You didn't need to kiII him.

368
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,560
And what about his beautifuI son?

369
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,758
His whoIe Iife in front of him.
Why did you need to kiII a beautifuI chiId?

370
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,276
After aII I've done, maybe I do deserve to die.
But you are no better than me.

371
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,912
But I can be. If I want.

372
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,710
God has given me the chance to choose.

373
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,791
What?

374
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,759
And maybe I shouId
give you a chance as weII.

375
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,594
You shouId. Anything. Anything. PIease.

376
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,835
PIease.

377
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,790
PIease.

378
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,996
Back out.

379
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,637
Of the escape?

380
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,233
Or die.

381
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:55,399
I wouIdn't...
I wouIdn't make it out there anyway.

382
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,195
Not with my procIivities.

383
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,193
I want you to give me your word.

384
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,589
You hear me?
I want you to give me your word!

385
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,229
You got it. You got it, John. You got it.
Come on, you got it.

386
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,197
Swear.

387
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,635
I'm out, I swear.

388
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,154
I swear to God.

389
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,755
I swear...

390
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,831
I swear...

391
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,710
AII right. AII right!

392
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,235
I have forgiven you. I have forgiven you.

393
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,956
You just have to pray
that the Lord Jesus Christ wiII do the same.

394
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,671
Hey, John.
You know, actuaIIy, about Jesus...

395
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,549
Say hi to him for me, wiII you?

396
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,991
- I'm through.
- Keep it up.

397
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,469
Come on. Stomp it.

398
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,869
BuIIs.

399
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,713
Oh... Hurry, hurry, hurry up.

400
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,917
Come on, come on, come on. Hurry, hurry.

401
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,276
(Westmoreland) You gotta staII 'em.
We're not ready.

402
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,876
- Hey, boss.
- What you doing out here?

403
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,509
- Taking a break.
- I gotta check the status in there.

404
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,398
- It's aII good.
- Then you won't mind me checking it out.

405
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,433
Hey. Hey!

406
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,919
What the heII's your probIem?

407
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,391
Hey, hey!
Step off or you're going to the SHU.

408
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,110
(guard) Burrows! Get off him!

409
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,872
Get off him.

410
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,599
Get off! Get up.

411
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,316
Thanks.

412
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,119
WeII, we Ieave tonight.

413
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,877
Where's my brother?

414
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,030
MichaeI, we got a big probIem.
