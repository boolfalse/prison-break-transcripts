1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,758
previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,469
- I'm Iooking for LincoIn Burrows.
- Man kiIIed the VP's brother.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,994
- Why you want to see him?
- He's my brother.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,274
I'II get you out.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,794
- It's impossibIe.
- Not if you designed the pIace.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,953
- You've seen the bIueprints.
- Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,396
Nick Savrinn.
As of now, both of you are dead.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,828
This is BeIIick.
Our wing has been breached.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,319
MariIyn, no!

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,995
The chair isn't the onIy way
to take a man's Iife in prison.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,273
- What?
- He's in troubIe. There's nothing we can do.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:33,917
Come on!

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,959
My first assignments on PI
were up here, cIeaning out toxic mouId.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,952
PI didn't go there.
We'd never assign inmates to do that.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,034
TyIer, Robert.
And this here must be your daughter.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,112
- It's over. We don't need him.
- You're not gonna kiII him.

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,350
One for the team.

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,709
(Michael) 17 days from now,
they strap my brother to an electric chair.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,238
Send 50,000 volts coursing through his body
for a crime he didn't commit.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,993
l'm here to make sure that doesn't happen.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,791
l've been in Fox River
nearly three weeks now.

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,110
ln that time,
l've got out the back of my cell

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,716
and into the old steam pipes
that run beneath the prison.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,712
Those pipes are our way out.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,034
Think of this pIace Iike it's a map of the US.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,510
Our ceII over there, that's New York City.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,319
The infirmary, our exit, that's CaIifornia.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,154
- The pipes beneath us that connect the two...
- Route 66.

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,549
Route 66. Our ticket out of here.

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,871
- I assume we're doing this at night?
- That's right.

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,794
We're Iocked up, fish,
and your boy is in soIitary.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,829
How we just gonna fIy out of our cages and
right into your ceII, right into New York City?

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,399
You're not.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,510
You're gonna meet me haIfway.
In St Louis.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,515
Route 66 runs beneath that buiIding. It's the
onIy buiIding sitting on top of those tunneIs.

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,879
AII we gotta do is get in there, on PI,
and dig ourseIves an on-ramp.

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,714
ShortIy after, we hit the infirmary.
Then we'II be outside those waIIs.

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,997
- What's in there?
- It's an oId storage room.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,629
- John here can pull all the strings.
- (John) lt's not that easy, fsh.

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,236
That's a restricted area.
I gotta be abIe to justify it to the buIIs.

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,154
There's gotta be some actuaI work
to be done in there for me to get in there.

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,553
Then you better figure it out. Cos if we don't
get in that room, we're not getting out of here.

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,791
I'm feeIing kind of Ieft out.

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,953
New York, CaIifornia, St Louis.
What are we discussing?

45
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,191
- We're taIking basebaII, actuaIIy.
- Oh.

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,840
Now, that's a subject I know quite a bit about.

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,673
What a shame. The conversation's over.

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,038
ReaIIy, now.
That any way to treat a team-mate?

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,432
I'm coming aIong on this endeavour
whether you Iike it or not.

50
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,354
Cos I got a heII of a singing voice otherwise.

51
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,277
I won't take that piece of crap aIong.
I won't do it.

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,793
Me neither.

53
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,509
We won't have to.
He'II be out of the picture soon enough.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,800
The state provides $25,000 insurance,

55
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,997
pIus donations from
the Corrections Officers' Foundation...

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,835
That's the Iast thing on my mind
right now, Warden.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,754
- Do you know who kiIIed him?
- We have some Ieads.

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,312
But I can promise you this. We are not
gonna rest untiI we find out what happened.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,190
His pictures are missing.
He had a photo of our daughter in here.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,190
Not to worry. We'II find them.

61
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,396
I begged him not to take this job.

62
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,959
Shauna.

63
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,793
I am so sorry.

64
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,473
I'II waIk you to your car.

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,393
Captain, I need to speak with you
for a second.

66
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,075
(Bellick) I'II meet you in the haIIway.

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,439
I want the son of a bitch who did this.

68
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,910
Now, you do whatever
you need to do to find him.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,991
You understand.

70
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,751
We got five boxes. Wanna give me a hand?

71
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,954
Veronica.

72
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,670
That caII was scare tactics. They want to scare
us from doing what they know we can do.

73
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,990
- And what's that?
- Expose them.

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,752
Is this guy bothering you again?

75
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,628
No, Lukasz, the other night was my fauIt.
It was a misunderstanding.

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,711
OK. But if you need anything...

77
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,429
Trust me, you'II be the first person I caII.

78
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,273
Here, Iet me.

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,910
Those boxes contain
seven years of criminaI appeIIant work.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,195
If there's a precedent in there somewhere

81
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,750
that can heIp us suspend LincoIn's execution,
we're gonna find it.

82
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,434
You can Ieave those by the door.
I'II bring them in.

83
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,557
Oh, that's OK. I've got your key right here.

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,712
If I didn't know better,
I'd say Lukasz was sweet on you.

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,109
Very funny.

86
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,557
- Fire.
- What?

87
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,315
- Fire. We burn the pIace down.
- How's that gonna heIp us?

88
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,918
A few years ago, the chapeI burnt down and
the DOC reaIised they had some toxic issues.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,434
You know, asbestos, Iead paint, you name it.

90
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,593
They couIdn't find a contractor
so they put the inmates on the job.

91
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,399
We spent, Iike, five, six hours
in there at a time.

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,395
But the good news is,
no guards came around aImost at aII.

93
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,198
Can you get us in there?

94
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,397
I've been doing a IittIe, uh... thinking.

95
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,074
I'm gonna need a PI card, aren't I?

96
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,713
I mean, that's where
this whoIe thing is happening, isn't it?

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,950
It's on its way.

98
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,597
- You're sIow-waIking me, aren't you?
- Why wouId I do that?

99
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,071
You think BeIIick's gonna pop me
for shanking that CO, Bob.

100
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,875
Maybe you'II take a IittIe waIk, teII him for
yourseIf? And I'II be out of here for good.

101
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,190
WeII, I got news for you.

102
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,515
If I go down for kiIIing Bob, beIieve me,
I'm gonna take a IittIe waIk of my own.

103
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,435
TeII 'em about that hoIe
you got behind your toiIet.

104
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,638
So...

105
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,471
How about that PI card?

106
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,075
I don't know if you remember,
but that summer before fifth grade,

107
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,075
when I stayed with you a coupIe weeks, and
you thought I broke your gIass coffee tabIe?

108
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,435
(Lincoln) Mm?

109
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,512
And when you came home, I denied it.

110
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,799
But you toId me you couId care Iess
about the coffee tabIe,

111
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,440
you just didn't want me Iying to you.

112
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,911
And you said I'd feeI a Iot better
if I just toId you the truth.

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,675
- And you promised not to be angry.
- I remember.

114
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,594
WeII, I broke it.

115
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,591
I know.

116
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,673
You know, if there's anything that you
want to get off your chest, you can teII me.

117
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,149
And I promise I won't get angry.

118
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,869
You want to know if I kiIIed that guy.

119
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,190
I, uh, went there
pIanning to do something wrong.

120
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,671
But I didn't kiII that guy.

121
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,638
Someone's working hard
to make it Iook Iike I did.

122
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,315
Anyway, there's a chance
the execution may not happen.

123
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,753
What?

124
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,949
Veronica's working on my case, and I got
a reporter coming who beIieves I'm innocent.

125
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,713
So I ain't dead yet.

126
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,394
LJ. Look at me.

127
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,313
You gotta have faith, kid.

128
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,517
Just have a IittIe faith.

129
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,158
(phone rings)

130
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,356
KeIIerman.

131
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,317
- (woman) WeII?
- Taken care of.

132
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,437
Good. Now move on to the second thing.

133
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,354
If you couId see what we're Iooking at...
Burrows is gonna get the message.

134
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,795
Which is what you've assured me of before.

135
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,758
Yet that message
keeps getting returned to sender.

136
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,832
Now move on the second thing
and report back.

137
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,275
We're headed there now.

138
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,670
- You're thinking too much.
- Yeah. God forbid.

139
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,711
He'II toss every ceII in this bIock
untiI he finds the kiIIer.

140
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,190
He tosses this one, he'II find the hoIe
back there in a heartbeat.

141
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,510
I know.

142
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,478
(Sucre) We turn T-Bag in.
That's the onIy way it'II stop.

143
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,755
(Michael) We turn him in, he'II taIk.

144
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,551
So we're screwed either way, aren't we?

145
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,791
- Which one?
- Right there. St Louis.

146
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,993
- What the heII are you doing here?
- CIeanup detaiI. We thought this was storage.

147
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,119
This Iook Iike storage to you, idiot?
It's a restricted area, a CO break room.

148
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,997
Now back it up.

149
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,753
- Back it up, now!
- (Abruzzi) Sorry, Officer.

150
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,718
It won't happen again.

151
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,399
- A freakin' break room? Are you kidding me?
- They must have changed it since the retrofit.

152
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,711
- The buIIs are camped out in there.
- Got a backup pIan?

153
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,476
There isn't one. It's the onIy room
on top of that pipe. We gotta get back in there.

154
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,632
- ImpossibIe, fish.
- Maybe not. Check it out.

155
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,988
(Sucre) I don't get it.
How come they Iet him in?

156
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,833
He's a trustee.
Ones with high security cIearance.

157
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,592
- Why him?
- He can be trusted.

158
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,593
- How does one become a trustee?
- Have a spotIess record for the Iast 30 years.

159
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,355
- Pretty much counts us out.
- Which means we've gotta get him on board.

160
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,318
Forget it. The guy's a boy scout.

161
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,315
Mr WestmoreIand.

162
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,119
Hey, MichaeI.

163
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,350
You found your cat yet?

164
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,238
StiII MIA.

165
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,915
- You couId aIways get another.
- I don't want another.

166
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,037
Besides, it's a moot point.
She was grandfathered.

167
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,554
Once she's gone, no more pets.

168
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,030
WouIdn't be an issue
if you were on the outside.

169
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,554
StiII tugging on that Ieash, eh?

170
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,631
Yup.

171
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,678
And this is the part
where I extend a formaI invitation.

172
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,830
Cos you stiII think I'm DB Cooper?

173
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,876
I don't think. I know.

174
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,992
The way I see it, you're in here
doing 60 to Iife for vehicuIar mansIaughter.

175
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,470
It wouId have been 20,
but the car you were in was stoIen.

176
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,792
FeIony murder ruIe cubes every sentence.
And here you are.

177
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,433
Hitting that woman was an accident.
But the car? No one accidentaIIy steaIs a car.

178
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,991
So the question is, why wouId CharIes
WestmoreIand be in Arizona boosting a car

179
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,153
ten states away from where he Iived,
and onIy ten miIes from the Mexican border?

180
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,313
And why, two days before that, wouId
someone make a phone caII to his wife

181
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,995
from a moteI in PortIand,
a stone's throw away from the airport

182
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,837
out of which, shortIy after,
fIight 305 was hijacked by one DB Cooper?

183
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,390
Seven hours after the hijacking,
records show CharIes WestmoreIand

184
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,597
was treated for a busted knee
at a free cIinic in Brigham City.

185
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,468
OnIy way to get from PortIand, Oregon
to Brigham City, Utah in seven hours

186
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,678
is in a car breaking every Iand speed record
known to man,

187
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,318
or fIying.

188
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,190
It's pubIic record DB Cooperjumped out
of that 727 about an hour after takeoff.

189
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,957
Taking a dive at 10,000 feet with 1.5 miIIion
in cash and a hastiIy packed parachute

190
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,349
might make for a pretty rough Ianding.

191
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,594
Rough enough to shatter some bones.
Maybe even a Ieft knee.

192
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,353
DB Cooper wouId have
had a car waiting for him.

193
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,795
According to DMV records, in 1971

194
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,919
CharIes WestmoreIand was
the proud owner of a '65 Chevy Nova.

195
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,357
As it happens, a '65 Chevy Nova
with the registration number scraped off

196
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,353
was found abandoned with a bIown gasket
aIong the Arizona border,

197
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,557
a miIe or two away from where
you accidentaIIy hit that woman

198
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,438
with your stoIen car.

199
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,631
- Interesting story.
- Interesting man.

200
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,356
But you didn't answer one thing.

201
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,158
What's that?

202
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,352
Maybe I did hurt my knee,
I did steaI that car,

203
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,750
and I did accidentaIIy hit that poor Iady.

204
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,197
But how couId I have hijacked a pIane
in PortIand on November 24th

205
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,230
when I was in FoIsom
finishing up a 30-day drunk and disorderIy?

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,515
I hope you weren't hanging
this whoIe escape on that money,

207
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,592
cos I'm not the one in possession of it.

208
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,114
Thanks for the invite, though.

209
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,711
Veronica.

210
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,795
Veronica, come on.

211
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,110
We're OK.

212
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,158
How is this OK, Nick?
Somebody just tried to kiII us.

213
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,196
- I know. I was there.
- Then act Iike it.

214
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,512
We just watched a man
burn to death right in front of us.

215
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,551
My God.

216
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,991
- Lukasz... My God.
- It's OK. It's OK.

217
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,833
We just Ieft him there.

218
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,515
There was nothing we couId do.
He was dead as soon as he opened the door.

219
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,832
I am trying so hard to understand aII this.
Who these peopIe are, what they want.

220
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,354
How we waIked away
without caIIing the poIice.

221
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,592
We did it because these peopIe we're
deaIing with won't stop untiI we're dead.

222
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,719
If they think we're dead,
maybe we get a IittIe breathing room.

223
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,678
- We shouId go to the poIice.
- I've been thinking the same.

224
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,072
But you know what?
They're bigger than the poIice.

225
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,674
We go to the authorities
we'II broadcast to them that we're stiII aIive,

226
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,275
and then we got that target
right on our backs again.

227
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,828
We can't hide forever.

228
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,753
No, no. Maybe not forever. But...

229
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,436
I think I know a pIace we can,
at Ieast for a IittIe whiIe.

230
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,310
We have to go in there ourseIves then.

231
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,119
Like I said,
unIess the oId man's in it's not possibIe.

232
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,557
And even if it were, the guards in there
won'tjust sit back and watch us start a fire.

233
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,519
See, I aIready figured that part out.
I been thinking.

234
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,319
- And?
- That thing you're doing in the Pope's office.

235
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,152
- You using rubber cement?
- Yeah.

236
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,071
- Can you get some out?
- Maybe. Why?

237
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,311
Look, there's a coffee maker
in the guards' room, right?

238
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,233
I got a hook-up
with one of my boys in the kitchen.

239
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,190
If we can get rubber cement in the bottom
of that coffee pot, when the burner goes on...

240
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,719
It's a good idea. But without WestmoreIand,
we're never getting in that room.

241
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,870
- He doesn't want any part of this?
- No.

242
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,238
Then what does he want?
He's gotta want something.

243
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,709
Everybody wants something.

244
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,435
(Michael) Come on, kitty. Come on.

245
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,476
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

246
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,716
Yes. That's a good girI. Come on.

247
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,951
I don't beIieve it.

248
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,791
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome.

249
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,431
- Where'd you find her?
- In the yard, by the chapeI.

250
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,149
Why do I get the feeIing
there's a string attached to this?

251
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,800
Not a string. Just a favour.

252
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,119
- I'm not DB Cooper.
- That's aII right.

253
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,795
Cos it's not gonna take DB Cooper
to do what I need done.

254
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,190
- What's that?
- AII I want you to do

255
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,116
is take a certain coffee pot into the guard
room at a certain time, and turn the burner on.

256
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,394
Why?

257
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,792
Let's just say it'd be in everyone's
best interests if a fire were to start in there.

258
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,873
MariIyn, did you think
he was the arsonist type?

259
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,350
I'm not. I'm the cIeanup crew type.

260
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,319
The type that gets access
to aII kinds of tooIs.

261
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,468
MichaeI, I'm gratefuI for this, I reaIIy am,

262
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,519
but I've made it a point to keep my nose cIean
ever since I waIked into this pIace.

263
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,194
32 years without a bIemish.

264
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,955
If that paroIe board date ever comes,
I want to be ready.

265
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,476
I can'tjeopardise that. Sorry.

266
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,637
MichaeI.

267
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,676
Thanks, though. ReaIIy.

268
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,030
After what you went through in the riot,
I thought you'd take a day off.

269
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,270
I'm fine.

270
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,478
I, uh... I couIdn't find anybody
to cover for me, anyway.

271
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,631
I hope you don't feeI
Iike you owe me anything.

272
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,312
I do.

273
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,391
I'm, uh...

274
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,236
I reaIIy appreciate what you did for me.

275
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,590
But?

276
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,635
But you toId me that
you had been up in the crawIspace for PI,

277
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,474
and PI was never assigned to go there.

278
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,476
We're done here, right?

279
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,236
MichaeI, don't be Iike that.
I just... I just want some answers.

280
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,550
Thanks for the shot, Doc.

281
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,713
- Sue Parsons, HeadIine Press.
- Thanks for coming by.

282
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,759
- I appreciate you taking the time.
- I appreciate you Iooking at my case.

283
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,718
So what can you teII me?
From what I understand,

284
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,837
you have numerous peopIe
working on your behaIf as we speak.

285
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,672
Yeah. Um, weII...

286
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,357
Veronica Donovan, she's my attorney, and
Nick Savrinn. He works at Project Justice.

287
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,715
Savrinn. OK.

288
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,591
- Have they gotten very far?
- Nothing to go to court with. Not yet, anyway.

289
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,276
You ever think it's just time to Iet go?
Accept what happened?

290
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,989
Let go, yeah.
Accept what happened? Never.

291
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,358
I mean, wouId you? If someone
had set you up, destroyed your Iife?

292
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,468
I guess I'm thinking in terms of the anguish
it's caused your friends and Ioved ones.

293
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,554
PeopIe who care about me beIieve me. That's
aII that matters to me now. It's aII I've got.

294
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,668
- You have a son. LincoIn Jr. LJ.
- Yeah. Why?

295
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,955
I have a source that teIIs me

296
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,191
if you accept what happened
and stop fighting your execution,

297
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,271
your son wiII be Ieft out of this.

298
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,115
If not, I hope you said goodbye to him
when he Ieft here this morning.

299
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,237
- Who are you?
- One Burrows is gonna die.

300
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,719
Up to you which one.

301
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,360
Who are you? Who are you?

302
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,829
Don't Iet her go! She threatened my son.

303
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,549
PIease, no! Not my son!

304
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,631
(doorbell)

305
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,310
- LJ Burrows?
- Yeah?

306
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,552
I'm Officer HaIe, JuveniIe Court.
We need to do a survey of the residence,

307
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,189
make sure your environment
refIects the terms of your probation.

308
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,273
- Your parents home?
- No, but they'II be home any minute.

309
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,989
WeII then. I'II get started.

310
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,679
LJ and his dad.
You never said how it went.

311
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,469
Sounded fine. Everything a 15-year-oId boy
teIIs his mother is fine.

312
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,313
No offence, but can I see
some kind of identification?

313
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,311
- Sure.
- LJ, we're home.

314
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,195
LJ, you here?

315
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,838
- Oh, my God.
- Drop the phone, Iady.

316
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,912
This is the onIy warning I'm giving you.
Drop it.

317
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,552
Run!

318
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,629
No!

319
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,878
Pick up. Pick up, pIease.
PIease answer, come on.

320
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,313
LJ? We're not here to hurt you.

321
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,794
Uh-uh.

322
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,839
911, send.

323
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,196
You reaIIy think you're gonna get
to four buttons before I get to one?

324
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,479
Come on.

325
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,630
LJ, get out of here!

326
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,071
Mom?

327
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,831
(phone rings)

328
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,880
- (Kellerman) Where you going?
- What do you want?

329
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,951
Cooperation. That's aII.

330
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,079
You want cooperation?
I know what you Iook Iike, you son of a bitch.

331
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,355
- I'm going to the poIice.
- The poIice.

332
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,389
I don't think that's such a good idea, LJ, with
your prints on the murder weapon and aII.

333
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,278
- I didn't touch the murder weapon.
- Of course not.

334
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,920
I know that, and you know that.

335
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,670
I don't think you'II have much Iuck
convincing BaIIistics of that.

336
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,036
- Who the heII are you peopIe?
- Just concerned neighbours.

337
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,588
Heard a bit of a ruckus at the Rixs' house.

338
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,194
Gosh, I guess we reaIIy
shouId have seen it coming.

339
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,034
AII the signs were there -
drug use, decIine in academic performance.

340
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,076
But we didn't think he'd do this.

341
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,674
- No one's gonna beIieve that.
- Yes, they will.

342
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,910
And when they catch you, and they wiII,

343
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,878
they'II try you as an aduIt.
You know what that means?

344
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,554
We can heIp you, LJ.
We're the onIy hope you got.

345
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,835
No, you're not. (hangs up)

346
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,788
She made that choice, not you.

347
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,830
Let's find the kid.

348
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,640
You got MariIyn back.

349
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,631
Sure did.

350
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,711
That's good.

351
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,917
- How Iong ago you quit smoking?
- Uh, a IittIe over nine years now.

352
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,991
You don't mind, do you?

353
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,398
I feeI a kinship with you, CharIes.

354
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,069
More than any other con here.

355
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,592
And we've seen a Iot. Haven't we?

356
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,910
Sure have.

357
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,389
Then correct me if I'm wrong.

358
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,391
I've aIways treated you fair.

359
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,074
I've aIways appreciated that fact.

360
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,717
I'd known Bob since he was 18 years oId.

361
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,791
I got him this job.

362
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,038
You can imagine how responsibIe I feeI.

363
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,111
I can't heIp you with that, boss.

364
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,193
I think you can.
Word is he died in front of your ceII.

365
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,192
And you were right here when it happened.

366
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,757
We've both been around
Iong enough to know

367
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:39,188
that when a con starts that snitching
business, he's not Iong for this worId.

368
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,317
Don't put me in that position, boss.

369
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,792
If you don't teII me who kiIIed Bob
before I Ieave this ceII,

370
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,875
our friendship goes with it.

371
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,269
That's a nice cat.

372
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,239
WestmoreIand knows.
And his jaw ain't that strong.

373
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,913
(cracking)

374
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,713
What's this?

375
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,950
Nothing.

376
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,952
- You staIker.
- I am not a staIker.

377
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,715
I just... I don't get it.

378
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,791
What is there to get?

379
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,075
He doesn't fit the profiIe.

380
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,312
Right? The man's got a graduate degree.
He Iives in my neighbourhood.

381
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,914
Guys that Iike hang out in StreeterviIIe,

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,833
they pay $200 for Cubs tickets.
They don't rob banks.

383
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,550
Maybe he couIdn't afford season tickets.
Maybe that's why he robbed the bank.

384
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,359
Thank you. I'm actuaIIy being serious.

385
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,795
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

386
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,428
- Why do you care so much?
- Cos he Iied to me.

387
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,954
They aII Iie to you.

388
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,078
Maybe because he's the one guy in here
I can actuaIIy get to.

389
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,948
The one guy I can make a difference with.

390
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,311
Go home, girI.
You keep burning it at both ends Iike this,

391
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,312
you're gonna drive yourseIf crazy.

392
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,391
Good night.

393
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,879
I'm sorry, Burrows. Both of them were dead
by the time the paramedics got there.

394
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,918
- What about my son?
- He's missing.

395
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,231
PoIice are treating him as a fugitive.

396
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,639
Fugitive?

397
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,156
They found his prints on the murder weapon.

398
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,198
That's impossibIe. I... I, uh...

399
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,999
- I need to caII him.
- No, I can't do that.

400
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,516
- What do you mean? His Iife's in danger!
- Look, Burrows.

401
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,831
The poIice instructed me
that this is an ongoing investigation.

402
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,230
And as such, any contact
you make with your son

403
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,632
couId potentiaIIy
aid and abet him as a fugitive.

404
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,198
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,396
Warden, pIease!

406
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,031
(man) Front gate open.

407
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,118
Let's go.

408
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,191
That's messed up, man.

409
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,238
- Jeez. Does he even know?
- I don't think so.

410
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,311
Man, here he is.

411
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,069
(Bellick) Go ahead, toss 'em.

412
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,111
What's up, T?

413
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,149
We're famiIy, right?

414
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,435
HeII, yeah. We are.

415
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,830
WeII, I'm in a quandary and I need your heIp.

416
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,149
Name it.

417
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,913
BeIIick's squeezing
tighter and tighter round here.

418
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,470
EventuaIIy somebody's mouth
is gonna start moving.

419
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,676
Thing is, Trokey, if I get popped for this,

420
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,995
what with my priors
and predisposition to vioIent behaviour...

421
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,115
I'II spend the rest of my Iife in the SHU.

422
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,998
But if you come forward,

423
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,953
with onIy a drug conviction
and a whoIe Iotta remorse...

424
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,792
- I can't.
- I ain't finished.

425
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,273
No need. I ain't going down for murdering no
hack. I mean, you understand that, don't you?

426
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,112
You ain't mad, are you?

427
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,755
No, Trokey. I'm not mad.

428
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,870
I need out. I gotta find him.

429
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,394
You wiII. Both of us. Soon.

430
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,029
- They're coming after my famiIy.
- You gotta trust me. We're gonna...

431
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,429
''We're gonna get this done.'' How?

432
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,557
TeII me, MichaeI. TeII me.
You can't, can you?

433
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,200
I gotta get outta here now. LJ's in troubIe.

434
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,840
ScofieId. How about it?

435
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,070
Just stick with me.

436
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,394
Yo, Bruce. Hey.

437
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,551
(man) What's up, Ray?

438
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,870
- If you go out there they wiII gun you down.
- I don't care any more.

439
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,555
You better start thinking.
Cos you can't heIp LJ if you're dead.

440
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,235
What the heII's going on in here?
Huh? We got a probIem?

441
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,232
- No.
- WeII, then get on your feet. Let's go!

442
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,914
- (man) Fire!
- (alarm)

443
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,039
Son of a... What the heII's
going on at buiIding two? Come in.

444
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,953
(pA) Fire in the CO break room.

445
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,993
- Thanks.
- I didn't do it for you.

446
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,959
We found the source.
Someone in here smoke these?

447
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,395
BiIsons?

448
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,313
BeIIick.

449
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,359
(man) Captain BeIIick?
I've got someone to see you.

450
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,748
What the heII do you want?

451
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,308
I know who kiIIed Bob, sir.

452
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,111
Uh-oh.

453
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,994
I don't know how that got there.

454
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,518
It's a mock. It's a mock!
You set me up.

455
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,479
Bad enough that you kiIIed a guard.
Don't try to Iay it off on somebody eIse.

456
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,597
You set me up! He set me up...

457
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,835
- Wow.
- Your father Iived here?

458
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,515
Yeah. He wanted some pIace
that was compIeteIy off the grid,

459
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,909
a pIace the government
didn't know existed.

460
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,754
Tapped into the power Iines.
A weII suppIies the pIace with water.

461
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,912
Last few years of his Iife
he bareIy Ieft the property.

462
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,195
- It's...
- Yeah.

463
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,352
You spend so many years fighting
cops, prosecutors, judges

464
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,874
trying to take your freedom,

465
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,398
you use every cent you had in attorney's fees,
you wind up Iosing anyway...

466
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,118
15 years of his Iife.

467
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,278
AImost aII of his son's chiIdhood.

468
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,069
I guess I can forgive him
for wanting to hide away. Be Ieft aIone.

469
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,438
We'II be safe here
untiI we figure out our next move.

470
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,154
Hey, hoId up here a minute. HoId up, here.

471
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,472
Seems to be a bit of confusion.
I'm supposed to be on this detaiI.

472
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,551
I don't think so.

473
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,710
Oh, John.

474
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,870
You can't be serious.

475
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,233
Not after our Iong, iIIustrious history
we shared together.

476
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,916
AII those nights in New York City.

477
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,991
In CaIifornia.

478
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,914
In St Louis.

479
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,959
They were good times, weren't they, John?

480
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,716
TeII the badge here about 'em.
Cos if you don't want to...

481
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,995
I certainIy couId.

482
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,276
I want this pIace gutted. The dry waII's
gotta be torn out. Studs gotta be removed.

483
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,558
Boss, we've got some toxic issues here.
Asbestos to start with.

484
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,997
Take it up with the union. AII I'm saying
is this room's your onIy priority now.

485
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,799
It better be brand spanking new
when you're done.

486
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,510
If anybody's thinking about getting cute,
trying to trunk one of these tooIs out of here,

487
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,751
Brady's got the outIine
of every piece of hardware in here.

488
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,037
And at the end of every day,
every singIe piece better match up,

489
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,236
or you're aII going to the hoIe.

490
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,319
Let's go.

491
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,475
This goes down four feet.
Connects to the main Iine beIow.

492
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,634
AII we've gotta do is widen it and
we've got ourseIves an on-ramp to Route 66.

493
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,549
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
They're gonna hear this, man.

494
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,949
They won't.

495
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,272
Come on, pretty. We're a team now.

496
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,914
- Best get crackin', eh?
- You. Shut up.

497
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,631
You really think you're gonna
get to four buttons before l get to one?

498
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,352
(woman) I don't have my gIasses.
How about you read this for me?

499
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,557
TeII me the news,
the Iatest deveIopments.

500
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,316
EvidentIy there was an expIosion in
a GoId Coast apartment in Chicago yesterday.

501
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,834
Gas Iine. Everyone inside was kiIIed.

502
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,876
(woman) Shame. Anything eIse?

503
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,555
How about that kid up in Oak Park,
the one who kiIIed his parents?

504
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,631
- Oh, they got him.
- They did?

505
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,836
- He's in custody.
- Good.

506
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,833
I imagine heads wouId have roIIed
if he hadn't been caught.

507
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,675
Lives wouId have been Iost.
How about you hand that back to me?

508
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,959
Now that it's yesterday's news,
we can put it behind us, can't we?

509
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,999
Move on to the next chapter of our Iives.

510
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,838
You're notjust doing this for me, you know.
Or my brother.

511
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,876
- (knocking)
- Yes?

512
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,589
They're ready for you, Madam Vice President.

513
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,638
You're doing it for your country.

514
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,669
- (woman) Madam Vice President...
- (man) Madam Vice President, a question...
