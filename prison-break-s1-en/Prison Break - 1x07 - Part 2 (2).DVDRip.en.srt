1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,831
(man) previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,309
- I didn't kiII that man.
- The evidence says you did.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,311
I was set up.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,792
Put down your weapon.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,519
I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison ceII.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,229
- I'm Iooking for LincoIn Burrows.
- Man kiIIed the vice president's brother.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,754
- Why do you want to see Burrows?
- He's my brother.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,910
- I'm getting you out.
- It's impossibIe.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,276
- Not if you designed the pIace.
- You've seen the bIueprints.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,749
Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,671
I spoke to your mother.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,911
- If you mean that guy at Fox River...
- He refuses to caII him his father.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,036
Take the onIy thing Burrows has Ieft.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,351
The chair isn't the only way
to take a man's life in prison.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,916
(woman) And now scenes
from last week's episode.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,675
ConstantIy coming up here for count won't
Iet me do what I need to do to get through.

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,035
The onIy way to stop count is a Iockdown.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,156
You'd better get the inmates riled up.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,155
AII right! That's it! Lockdown!

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,959
The anonymous caIIer
couIdn't have seen LincoIn.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,032
- How do you know?
- Because the caII came from Washington DC.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,434
This is BeIIick. Our wing has been breached.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,033
Hooke's Law of eIasticity.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,716
If we driII hoIes in strategic Iocations, we
compromise the waII's Ioad-carrying capacity.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,394
- Take the cuffs off.
- A rookie CO.

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,597
- Get out of here, T-Bag.
- I think we can work something out.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,352
No deaI.

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,515
- (governor) Where's my daughter?
- (warden) She's fine.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,910
A guard assures us everything is fine.
We have everything under controI.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,672
You'd better hope you do.

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,918
They're breaking out.

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,831
They're breaking...

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,319
Shh.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,119
- We need a favour.
- Heavy hitters want this done.

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,192
Burrows is as good as dead.
You Iooking for ScofieId?

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,272
- Yeah, Turk.
- Come on.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,238
Hey, yo! Stroke is about to get the doc.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,956
Finish what we started.

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,679
No one touches the CO. No one.

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,348
(inmates shouting and yelling)

41
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,392
(pA) Attention all personnel.
Attention all personnel.

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,436
Secure the perimeter.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,157
Remove private vehicles from all areas.

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,835
Attention. The area is on secure lockdown.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,195
Let's go!

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,195
- Any word from the governor?
- Not yet, boss.

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,676
- BeIIick! Get those guys in Iine.
- Get 'em into formation.

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,432
- Going back in?
- Not yet.

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,638
We cut the water off about an hour ago.
The stink aIone shouId drive 'em out of there.

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,235
- You think that's gonna work?
- No, but it's protocoI.

51
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,390
And we're aII gonna do this by the book.

52
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,109
- It's the best chance we have.
- (inmate) Hey!

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,318
This is the warden.
What's happening in there?

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,356
We got some demands.

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,874
TeII them we need the air back on.

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,916
We need the AC.

57
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,710
We got a hostage - the guard.

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,314
We got a hostage - the new guard.

59
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,311
Find out who's in there.

60
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,956
They got Bob.

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,555
And the girI doctor. TeII him we got her.

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,789
- Why don't you do it?
- I don't wanna get shot.

63
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,756
And we got the girI doctor.

64
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,718
- The doctor?
- There's onIy one.

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,588
How the heII did that happen?
How did they get their hands on her?

66
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,673
- I thought she was safe in Sick Bay.
- We gotta get her out. We gotta go in now.

67
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,797
- We can't do it, sir.
- Why not?

68
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,110
It's not by the book.

69
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,358
Sir, I've got some updates for you.

70
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,435
HeIp!

71
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,631
HeIp!

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,950
ScofieId's in here?

73
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,712
Argh!

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,189
You sure he's in here?

75
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,112
Turk.

76
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,311
Turk.

77
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,390
You ain't gonna use that.

78
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,795
You making up the ruIes now, ese?

79
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,431
- It's my house. You got a probIem?
- Yeah, I got a probIem. We aII do.

80
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,476
No probIem.

81
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,556
I swear to God. I'm not gonna say anything.
I didn't see anything.

82
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,428
That's right, badge. You didn't see nothing.

83
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,554
Wait. Don't Ieave.

84
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,152
Sorry. I'II be back.

85
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,677
Don't worry. I'II cover for you.

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,993
Don't worry, CO. AII right?
I'm not gonna hurt nobody.

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,116
I'm part of the team now.

88
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,555
HeIp a brother out. Drag that over.

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,072
That's the way. Mm-hm-hm-hm.

90
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,071
(banging)

91
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,436
PIease return to your seats
and fasten your seatbeIts.

92
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,911
We are making our finaI approach
into Washington DC.

93
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,549
We need to focus on the reaI question.

94
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,710
Who wanted Terrence Steadman dead?

95
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,394
The caII came from DC.
What does that teII you?

96
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,790
You gotta think past the government.
Anybody couId be here.

97
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,553
A business partner, a rivaI.

98
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,313
Before Steadman was kiIIed,
EcoFieId introduced

99
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,472
a prototype eIectric engine
at the techno conference.

100
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,156
$60 barreIs of oiI wouId be obsoIete
if that thing ever hit the mainstream.

101
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,959
CouId be oiI. OiI companies.

102
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,794
SuppIiers, consumers, everything in between.

103
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,429
Or the government of an oiI-based economy.

104
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,114
Like the United States.

105
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,476
- Can I take your soda?
- Sure. Thank you.

106
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,239
At any rate, we Iand, we meet my guy,

107
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,393
and even if we don't find the person
who tipped off the cops, we find his phone.

108
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,313
The paper traiI begins.

109
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,391
(shouting continues)

110
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,871
OnIy a matter of time, Doc.
It's onIy a matter of time.

111
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,157
HeIp!

112
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,551
(police siren)

113
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,960
That's the governor.

114
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,555
Whatever happens, don't say anything.

115
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,831
Governor. Appreciate you coming.

116
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,755
Since our conversation, the situation has
escaIated. But we're making good progress...

117
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,073
Just cut the crap, Warden,
and teII me where my daughter is.

118
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,150
HeIp!

119
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,597
HeIp!

120
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,236
(T-Bag) We got here TyIer Robert Hudson.

121
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,390
That is fancy, CO!

122
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,677
And Iook at that address - 144 Oak Park...

123
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,199
- What's this?
- Terrace.

124
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,508
Terrace. How'd you swing that, CO?

125
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,071
Sounds Iike you're about something,
Iiving on a terrace.

126
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,549
I can't wait to kick it on a terrace. What?

127
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,792
Oh.

128
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,358
- This here must be your daughter.
- Put it back.

129
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,431
Prom?

130
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,118
You know what they say
about a prom dress, don't you?

131
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,514
She didn't come home that night, did she?

132
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,195
No, she wore that aII night Iong.

133
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,794
Next morning...

134
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,749
she had to throw that dress in the trash can
behind the moteI so her momma didn't see...

135
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,479
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

136
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,509
- What the heII are you doing?
- Kicking with Deputy Dawg. TaIking women.

137
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,712
I'II be very cIear here,
because you and I face an evoIutionary gap.

138
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,232
You ain't gonna hurt this man.
We're Iocked into this thing now.

139
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,912
Understand?

140
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,598
And he's the onIy Ieverage we have.

141
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,748
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome.

142
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,351
Now, do we have an understanding?

143
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,671
I'm on your side now. You understand me?

144
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,115
I'm just going with the fIow.

145
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,478
You Iet me know
when you're done with your ''Ieverage''.

146
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,151
Let me out!

147
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,588
Let's smoke the bitch out!

148
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,031
(banging)

149
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,271
(Sara) HeIp!

150
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,038
What are you thinking now, Doc?
(cackles)

151
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,031
It ain't gonna hurt reaI bad
if you make it easy.

152
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,078
If you make it hard, though...

153
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,591
Open the door! Come here!
Open this door! Open this door!

154
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,194
Come on. Grab my hand.

155
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,240
Come on!

156
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,190
Come here. Open the door. Open this door!

157
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,591
I've got you.

158
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,917
Are you aII right?
It's OK. I'm not gonna hurt you.

159
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,076
See these pipes?
We're gonna stay on them.

160
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,711
They go through the waII and over the
haIIway and they'II get us out of here.

161
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,678
AII you have to do is foIIow me.

162
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,273
- OK?
- Yeah.

163
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,032
OK.

164
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,838
Let's go.

165
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,111
Where did she go?

166
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,071
(chuckling)

167
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,512
- Where are we meeting him?
- Georgetown. In a garage.

168
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,675
He's a private investigator. He used
to be my roommate in freshman year at Duke.

169
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,797
- (reporter) The disturbance has escalated.
- Nick, Iook.

170
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,348
At least two hostages have been confrmed

171
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,468
in what is now being called a full-scale riot
here at the Fox River State penitentiary.

172
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,710
ShouId we go back or keep going?

173
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,791
We shouId keep going.

174
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,069
You wanna go back and stand there with
the rest of the peopIe who aren't heIping?

175
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,832
Come on.

176
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,710
The National Guard responded after Frank
Tancredi declared a state of emergency...

177
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,678
- Come on, honey. It's time to go.
- HoId on. HoId on.

178
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,514
- No word on what caused the disturbance.
- That's not Fox River?

179
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,194
Tensions often run high at this facility.

180
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,636
Fox River is a level-fve institution,
housing dangerous...

181
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,075
- What are you doing?
- We have to go. Come on.

182
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,474
- No. Dad might be in troubIe.
- He's aIready in troubIe. We can do nothing.

183
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,313
Just don't make a scene, OK?

184
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,109
He gets very uncomfortabIe with this thing.
Just... Let's just go.

185
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,510
Oh, God forbid, man!

186
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,879
We're just taIking about my oId man here
and his Iife, if that's aII right with you?

187
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,428
- Leave me out of this.
- I am Ieaving you out of it.

188
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,397
I Ieft you out of it the day I met you.

189
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,392
Nothing in her Iife or mine
has anything to do with you.

190
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,040
- I'II pretend I didn't hear that.
- Yeah? Or what?

191
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,476
- This is the kind of crap I have to deaI with.
- Let me handIe it!

192
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,350
The kind of crap you have to deaI with?!
You got no cIue, do you?

193
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,155
- Honey...
- Leave me aIone! Get off me.

194
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,234
- Don't touch your mother Iike that. Take that.
- Stop it! Stop!

195
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,230
Go upstairs, LJ, now!

196
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,038
Go!

197
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,838
- You Iove that man?
- Just go.

198
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,718
- You Iove that man?
- Do what I say.

199
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,755
(coughing)

200
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,670
Turk, why are you doing this? Who sent you?

201
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,590
Why? Why?

202
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,834
Why did you do this?
What's it aII about? Who sent you?

203
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,994
Aren't you gonna heIp me?
You've gotta heIp me. PIease.

204
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,351
Turk!

205
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,431
(prays in Spanish)

206
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,510
- Who is your friend?
- You scared the heII out of me.

207
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,911
Who are you taIking to?

208
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,755
It's the fish's idea. The deviI marks the waII
so you know where to driII the hoIes.

209
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,756
- You're making hoIes with an egg beater?
- Crazy, huh? It's caIIed the Hooker Law.

210
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,949
He says that if you poke the exact right hoIes
in something big and strong, it gets weak.

211
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,598
That's true.

212
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,275
When the waII is weak, we can take it down.

213
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,835
- At Ieast that's the pIan.
- Yeah. That's aIways the pIan.

214
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,116
You shouId never underestimate a waII.

215
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,919
You see, sometimes,

216
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,039
no matter how hard you try,
itjust won't give in.

217
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,312
- Are you aII right?
- I'm OK. I'm fine.

218
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,071
Don't Iet 'em get away.

219
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,151
(all talk at once)

220
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,479
You know what? I need a minute. I'm sorry.

221
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,552
- It's not much further.
- Just a sec.

222
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,995
We can stop if you want. Catch your breath.

223
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,197
OK. Yeah, I couId use a minute.

224
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,549
- Come here, girI. Come here.
- Things shouId be winding down now.

225
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,758
Pretty soon, the powers that be
wiII break in and it'II aII be over.

226
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,513
It's just a matter of time.

227
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,319
What's happening in A-Wing?

228
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,795
AII heII's breaking Ioose.

229
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,315
But I think if we stay up here,
we shouId be OK.

230
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,555
I can't beIieve this is happening.

231
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,030
Yeah. Come here.
Gonna catch you reaI good, Doc.

232
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,272
I miss you, girI.
I know you want it, girI.

233
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,311
You ever been to Baja?

234
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,151
Mexico?

235
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,710
There's this great pIace down there.
20 bucks a night.

236
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,394
Hammock on the back deck.

237
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,074
Beers are 50 cents.

238
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,151
25 cents at happy hour.

239
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,914
You ever been to ThaiIand? ThaiIand's great.

240
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,278
MichaeI, if you're trying to caIm me down,
you're doing a terribIe job.

241
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,635
But I am trying.

242
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,871
Shh! You hear that?

243
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,872
- Why are you here?
- What do you mean?

244
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,432
CrawIing around in the ceiIing,
risking your Iife.

245
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,559
You needed heIp and... I came to find you.

246
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,153
How did you know where to go?

247
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,317
When everything went off in A-Wing, the COs
Ieft the station and I saw you on the monitor.

248
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,279
One of my first assignments on PI,
we were up here cIeaning out toxic mouId.

249
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,275
Took days, so I'm
kind of famiIiar with the Iayout.

250
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,670
- Hope you wore a mask.
- Excuse me?

251
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,878
To prevent inhaIation.
MouId can be reaIIy dangerous.

252
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,394
Yeah, I wore a mask.

253
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,715
Get up there. Get up there.

254
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,953
The door to the visitation room -
do you ever use it?

255
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,749
Um... Not usuaIIy,
but my access card shouId work.

256
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,479
(Stroker) Get up.

257
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,718
Psst.

258
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,189
Come on.

259
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,430
Let's go.

260
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,673
Come here.

261
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,751
Let's go!

262
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,948
Dammit! Come here!

263
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,077
I understand.
But beIieve me, Sara is our top priority.

264
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,597
The heII she is!
I ordered a state of emergency an hour ago.

265
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,399
- Get me your commanding officer.
- Right away.

266
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,632
- Now what the heII is going on out here?
- Negotiating. They can't hoId out for Iong.

267
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,156
- Negotiating?
- It's 100 degrees. They're aImost out of water.

268
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,834
We are trying to avoid
doing anything extreme.

269
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,152
I don't care if it takes a massacre to get
her out of there. Do you understand me?

270
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,708
- If you're not going to do it, I am.
- Sir.

271
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,588
- Captain, spread the news - you're going in.
- Yes, sir.

272
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,433
It's time to do this my way.

273
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,031
Come here! Come here!

274
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,111
(shouting)

275
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,111
AII right.

276
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,111
I got you.

277
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,357
Hey, fish! You gonna keep that nurse
aII to yourseIf?

278
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,791
(Stroker roars)

279
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,669
Stop!

280
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,111
(screaming)

281
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,911
Agh! My knee!

282
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,431
Come on. This way.

283
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,673
Good caII, Governor, bringing in the big guns.

284
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,117
- Appreciate your support.
- Captain Brad BeIIick.

285
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,309
I sent you a Ietter earIier this year -
my views on penaI reform.

286
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,630
Oh. And what are they?

287
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,752
These inmates don't mess around.
Us COs need to get tough.

288
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,718
Warden Pope's a good guy,
but he doesn't understand

289
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,395
that you gotta grab the situation
by the gonads and take controI.

290
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,155
- And is that what you wouId do?
- Yes, sir. That's exactIy what I'd do.

291
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,673
So...

292
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,789
Give me that. Give me that.

293
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,510
- I don't know if...
- Give me that. DemoIition runs in the famiIy.

294
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,989
The whoIe trick is pressure.

295
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,751
Where shouId I...? Here? Good.

296
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,960
You see, you shouId push hard, but not
too hard. Just Iike when you, you know...

297
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,110
- But you gotta be carefuI.
- Yeah, I know.

298
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,317
I mean it. One sIip and you'II hit the gas pipe.

299
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,913
Gas pipe?

300
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,117
Yeah, you know,
as in pipe that carries the gas.

301
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,639
- We can't go this way.
- We have to. There's no other way.

302
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,836
- This is it.
- No, it's not.

303
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,475
- It's back this way.
- This won't heIp.

304
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,039
- Trust me.
- If you're wrong...

305
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,315
We don't have time.

306
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,396
Not too hard. Not too soft.

307
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,832
When I was her age, I had such bad skin.

308
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,310
Acne, they caIIed it.

309
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,230
She Iooks just Iike aII them girIs
that made fun of me.

310
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,834
After I kiII you,

311
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,310
I'm gonna crawI out that hoIe
and caII me up a Iimousine

312
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,915
and me and your baby's going to the prom.

313
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,397
- What's the news with Sara?
- StiII trying to find her.

314
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,600
- You don't even know where she is?
- We're on it. Once we do, we'II Iet you know.

315
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,116
You shouId Iisten to Captain BeIIick
and gas the whoIe bIock.

316
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,318
- Captain BeIIick?
- He knows what these guys can do.

317
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,994
You'd better pray
that Sara gets out in one piece.

318
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,072
I do, Governor, but this is stiII my prison.

319
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,914
Whatever happens, I take fuII responsibiIity.

320
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,195
Excuse me.

321
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,672
It's this way.

322
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,351
Yeah.

323
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,155
Yes! We're through.

324
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,080
Time to put this theory to the test.

325
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,674
I guess we start chipping away now.

326
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,432
Right on.

327
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,511
She's aII yours, paI.

328
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,271
This is it.

329
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,671
We did it.

330
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,549
That's it.

331
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,390
- Wait. I can't Ieave you here.
- You have no choice. I'm a bad guy.

332
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,715
AII right, go, man. Go, go, go!

333
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,360
Come on, man. Through there. Check this out.

334
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,829
- (man over radio) Can you see the assailant?
- Affirmative. I've got him in sight.

335
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,754
What are you gonna do?

336
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,400
Go back to my ceII. Stay out of the way.

337
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,357
- MichaeI.
- What?

338
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,437
They see us.

339
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,431
- You have to go.
- I can't. They'II kiII you.

340
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,918
You go out the door. I'II drop to the fIoor.

341
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,830
- They're sharpshooters. They won't miss.
- That's why you can't stay.

342
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,150
- What's going on?
- I'm coming, Doc.

343
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,639
Go!

344
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,719
(gunfre)

345
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,191
(loud rock music)

346
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,075
(Veronica) Who's this?

347
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,675
That's my guy.

348
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,756
- Hey.
- Nice ride.

349
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,956
Yeah. You Iike that?

350
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,474
Cop auction. 300 bucks.

351
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,829
You must be Veronica. Whoever tipped off the
cops about Burrows caIIed from this number.

352
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,395
That wasn't an easy trace.
I hope you're not too bummed.

353
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,473
- Why? What's the probIem?
- It's a payphone.

354
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,798
- This is it.
- Anyone couId have made that caII.

355
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,714
Any one of the miIIion peopIe
who pass through here every day.

356
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,268
That's empty.

357
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,552
What about that?

358
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,156
FederaI Energy Commission.
That's interesting.

359
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,679
- Where are you going?
- To see if this guy knows what was in there.

360
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,790
Excuse me.

361
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,156
Do you what was in that space before?

362
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,471
OK, thanks.

363
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,515
Hey. It was the regionaI headquarters
for a company caIIed EcoFieId.

364
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,149
- (Veronica) Terrence Steadman's company.
- (Nick) That's right.

365
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,831
(phone rings)

366
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,958
- HeIIo?
- (man) Veronica.

367
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,349
Who... who is this?

368
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,718
That's the problem, Veronica.
You ask too many questions.

369
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,836
Now l have one for you.

370
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,639
ls Lincoln Burrows really worth it?

371
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,756
Here, give me the phone.
Who is this?

372
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,991
(man) Nick Savrinn.
l just want to let you know,

373
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,674
as of now, both of you are dead.

374
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,031
Come on. Let's go.

375
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,036
(pA) All inmates have one minute
to return to their cells.

376
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,553
MichaeI!

377
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,320
MichaeI!

378
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,516
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

379
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,838
I didn't touch the man.
I didn't touch him. Ask him.

380
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,515
Things have changed since we Iast met.

381
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,236
ReIax, partner. I'm in on it now.

382
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,199
The rabbit pIan.
Know aII about it. So does the CO.

383
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,677
- Why'd you take Abruzzi down?!
- I didn't. He just showed up.

384
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,399
- And the paedophiIe thinks he's in!
- I know.

385
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,914
Shut up! Where's MichaeI?

386
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,991
Where's MichaeI?

387
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,354
MichaeI! MichaeI!

388
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,111
(pA) Final warning.

389
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,757
- Where have you been?
- AII over. Are you aII right?

390
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,434
- Yeah. Are you?
- Yes. Yes.

391
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,031
Move!

392
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,316
- We'II take it from here.
- Are you OK?

393
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,391
I'm OK.

394
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,954
- BeIIick.
- She's waIking. That's a good sign.

395
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,960
Yeah. Astute observation.

396
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,669
Maybe you'd Iike
to share that with the governor.

397
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,639
- I was tense. I was just trying...
- Next time you bad-mouth me to a superior,

398
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,032
there are gonna be serious consequences.
Do I make myseIf cIear, Captain?

399
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,429
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

400
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,196
Sara!

401
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,555
Sara. Sara.

402
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,270
- Dad.
- Sara. Are you aII right? Are you OK?

403
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,989
I toId you when you took this job.
I knew something Iike this wouId happen.

404
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,116
I knew something Iike this wouId happen.

405
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,476
God, Dad, how about,
''I'm happy to see you aIive''?

406
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,870
WeII, I just want you to see
what you're doing to yourseIf.

407
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,635
There is nobody
that is forcing you to be here.

408
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,711
I know. Thanks, Dad.

409
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,433
AII right. Let's cIean this mess up.

410
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,991
(alarm)

411
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,072
- What's going on?
- We did it.

412
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,958
Those IittIe Hooker hoIes were right on.

413
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,349
Get everyone out of here. EspeciaIIy him.

414
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,149
- I'm gonna take care of him myseIf.
- You're not gonna kiII him.

415
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,959
- I'm not coming back.
- It's over! We don't need him.

416
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,476
- You're not gonna kiII him.
- You're gonna Iet him waIk?

417
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,916
- That ain't for you to decide!
- After aII he's seen?!

418
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,514
- After aII he's seen.
- Get out!

419
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,273
Keep your mouth shut and turn Ieft.

420
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,191
Get out!

421
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,872
If we have a probIem,
we know where to find you.

422
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,837
Mau-mau.

423
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,758
Forget about it. Just forget about it, aII right?

424
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,751
No!

425
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,551
One for the team.

426
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,992
OK, so this is a compIete Iist
of the injured and the dead.

427
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,310
- And it's the whoIe Iist?
- Yeah.

428
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,391
Thank you, very much.

429
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,911
Hey, Ron.

430
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,433
Dr Tancredi.
GIad to see you made it out aIive.

431
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,511
Yeah. Me too.

432
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,797
Question.

433
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,795
Why did your department assign inmates
on PI to do a toxic mouId removaI project?

434
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,440
What toxic mouId project?

435
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,951
In the crawI space in A-Wing.

436
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,596
PI didn't go there.
We'd never assign inmates to do that.

437
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,870
- OK, sorry.
- No probIem.

438
