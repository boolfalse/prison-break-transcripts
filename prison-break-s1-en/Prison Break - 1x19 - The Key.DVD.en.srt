This kid in my neighborhood,

his dad had a basebaII card coIIection.

164
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,526
So I figured, you know, I'd swipe it.

Doesn't mean nothing to me, you know.

This card, it was worth $300,000.

00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,524
So they sIapped me with grand Iarceny.

That's why I'm here.

As soon as I heard they granted you
a visit with your son,

178
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,097
I knew they'd make a move on you.

They're after me, not you.

or is that what you were toId?

Why'd you Ieave?

Iike I did,

you had to commit to Ieaving

I took aII that information with me.
That's why they're doing this to you.

I don't know why you're in there,

but if there's one thing those guys
that brought me here taught me,

218
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,900
is that if you fight, if you struggIe,
you onIy make things worse.

00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:48,237
Nika, I wanna do
whatever I can to heIp MichaeI.

311
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,575
To do that, I need you to teII me
what it is you think he's mixed up in.

312
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,072
-I think this is a mistake.
-No, no, it's not at aII.

313
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,912
-If you can just teII me what it is...
-PIease, just keep an eye on him.

314
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,044
God, I'm sorry. Thanks.

315
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,316
Listen, couId I just have a contact number
for you in case I see something wrong.

316
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,619
I don't think that's a good idea.
PIease don't teII him that we met.

317
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:09,716
I... I...

318
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,494
Something I don't get.

319
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,871
How couId kiIIing me stop you?

320
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,806
'Cause I'm the one who Ieaked
the information about EcofieId.

321
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:31,541
They couId've covered up the scandaI
a thousand different ways,

322
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,414
but they chose to fake
Terrence Steadman's death.

323
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,857
And they chose you
'cause they knew it wouId fIush me out.

324
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,251
They knew that any man with a son
on death row who was innocent

325
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,392
wouId have to come forward.

326
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,661
But you didn't.

327
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,659
We had a cause, Linc.

328
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,705
We have a cause.

329
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,135
Their wars can be averted

330
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,613
and miIIions of Iives can be saved.

331
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,478
So you were wiIIing to sacrifice one.

332
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,777
Yeah.

333
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,056
At Ieast I thought.

334
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,660
But I couIdn't watch you die.

335
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,826
You know what you've done?

336
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,036
The mother of my chiId is dead.

337
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,568
-I know.
-Do you?

338
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,233
Then I'm guessing you know
MichaeI's in Fox River

339
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,437
-and LJ's rotting in some jaiI.
-I know aII of it.

340
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,074
-If you think for a second...
-You don't have a choice right now.

341
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,548
This is aII on you. AII of it.

342
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,980
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here.

343
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,761
'Cause there's stiII a chance
we can make it right.

344
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,055
That man in there
is our transportation out of here,

345
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:30,464
which means that, you go after him,

346
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,462
and that messes with my chances
of me seeing my famiIy.

347
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,630
So I ain't gonna Iet that happen.

348
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,942
So why don't you just hand me
that shank you're hoIding, huh?

349
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,175
Good.

350
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,365
-Hey, Sara.
-Hey, Rick.

351
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,033
You aII right?

352
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,804
Yeah. I can't find my keys.
WouId you Iet me in?

353
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:11,967
Oh, sure.

354
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,446
-I'm surprised to see you here.
-That makes both of us.

355
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,380
Look.

356
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,955
You were right and I'm sorry.

357
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,361
I shouId never have gotten you
invoIved in this.

358
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,398
-Oh, it's okay.
-No, it's not.

359
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,767
If anyone knew what I asked...

360
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,308
I'm not even sure why I did it.

361
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,502
Thank you.

362
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,610
Now we're even.

363
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,682
-You didn't owe me anything.
-Yes, I did.

364
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,948
I owed you everything,
but that's over now.

365
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,818
Goodbye.

366
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,866

I think he's got something.

368
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,074
Go, for BeIIick.

369
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:28,016
We just got a caII from Steve
Schimek up at the junkyard.

370
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,020
-Our Mustang is on the premises,
-BELLICK: He seen Burrows?

371
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:34,023
Yep, l got a couple of units
five, 10 minutes away, tops,

372
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,888
Good, I'm right behind you.

PIace is gonna be crawIing with cops.
You know that, right?

375
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,400
There's an unimproved road
down by the river.

376
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:49,268
There's a chance
they haven't bIocked it off yet.

377
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,138
We got troubIe.

378
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,672
Come on. Through here.

379
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,285
Come on.

380
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,450
Hey!

381
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,534
Get out of here.

382
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,229
Go.

383
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,267
Turn around.

386
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,167
-AII right on your knees!
-Right there! Right there!

387
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,799
On your knees! Hands up! Let's see them !

388
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:03,874
Take him down!

389
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,000
Get down! Get down!

390
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,541
You thought you'd go
for a IittIe stroII, did you?

391
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,632
SUCRE: Did you hear about Avocado?

392
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,237
Got his salchicha sIiced.

393
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,439
-How?
-Tweener.

394
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,308
But Avocado's saying
it got caught on the frame

395
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,938
whiIe he was hopping
down off his bunk, yeah.

396
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,478
Why did he Iie?

397
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,543
He doesn't want Tweener to go to
the SHU 'cause he can't get him in there.

398
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:55,057
AII I have to say is, as soon as
Avocado gets out of the infirmary,

399
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,683
Tweener is a dead man.

400
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,553
How's that key coming?

401
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,960
What about your car?
You know, sometimes...

402
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,068
I just checked.

404
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,866
No, 'cause I had them this morning.

405

WeII, then, they gotta be here.

406
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,042
Just retrace your steps.
When did you first notice they were gone?

407
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,048
When I came back from Iunch...

408
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,263
Hey, Kev, I need to take a Iook
at that visitation Iog.

I need to know where he is.

412
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,259
-Who?
-Fibonacci.

413
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:13,201
You see, my conversion requires
that I not onIy seek forgiveness,

414

but provide forgiveness,
even to my greatest transgressors.

I'm not.

(HUMMING)

465
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,816
Boss.

466
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,592
I heard Avocado
cut his hose on your bunk.

467
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,191
Must have been some serious gymnastics
going on.

468
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,031
I got something for you this time, Boss,

469
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,697
but I want guaranteed protection
from Avocado,

470
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,537
-and I want time cut off my bid.
-Anything eIse?

471
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:56,374
CoupIe of big-canned whores
avaiIabIe to you 24/7?

472
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,778
BeIieve me, what I got is worth it.

473
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,977
So, are you gonna step up or what?

474
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,356
This is your Iast chance, Tweener.

475
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,825
You bIow smoke again, they'II be
scraping you off the heeI of my boot.

476
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,896
ScofieId and his whoIe PI crew,

477
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,097
they're escaping.
