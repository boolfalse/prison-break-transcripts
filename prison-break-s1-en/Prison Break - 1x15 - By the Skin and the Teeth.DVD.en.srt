MALE NARRATOR:
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,964
I'm through.

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,371
See you on the other side.

4
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,144
It can't be done.

5
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,009
We're not getting out of here.

6
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,245
There's onIy one person
who can reaIIy stop this execution.

7
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,218
WouId you taIk to your father for me?

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,553
I'm the Iast person in the worId
that my father Iistens to.

9
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,924
The Governor has reviewed your case.

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,826
He's not granting cIemency.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,397
Let's proceed.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,131
I came in here a man.

13
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,669
Give me the strength
to waIk out of here a man.

14
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,236
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

15
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,922
Doctor, you can Ieave now.

16
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,335
It's him.

17
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:24,901
MichaeI.

18
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,579
What's he saying?

19
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,378
MichaeI, turn around.

20
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:32,943
It's him.

21
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,917
What do you think he's saying?

22
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,285
MichaeI, turn around.

23
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,030
(PHONE BEEPING)

24
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,146
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

25
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,054
What's happening?

26
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,852
What the heII's going on in there?

27
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:53,054
I can't teII you how sorry I am
that you've had to go through aII of this.

28
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,565
LincoIn.

29
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,373
What happened in there?

30
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,782
Judge KessIer caIIed.
The execution's been deIayed.

31
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,114
What do you mean deIayed?

32
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,086
ApparentIy, some new evidence
has come to Iight.

33
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,283
-What evidence?
-I don't understand.

34
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,690
How Iong do we have? One day, two days?

35
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,854
That's aII the information
I have at the moment. I'm sorry.

36
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,191
I'II give you a minute.

37
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,997
You okay?

38
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,704
I need to know how much time we have.

39
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,538
I'II go and see the judge and find out.

40
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,744
You're with MichaeI. You'II be okay.

41
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,179
-Did you see him?
-Who?

42
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,847
-The guy in the viewing room.
-No.

43
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,323
It was Dad.

44
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,827
It was Dad.

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,763
It was him. I know it was.

46
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,860
That's not possibIe, Linc.

47
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,961
It is possibIe. I saw him.

48
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,268
I don't know how you couId have.

49
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,570
There were onIy haIf a dozen peopIe
in that room.

50
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,840
Me, Veronica and a bunch of reporters.

51
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,878
-He wasn't there.
-You don't know that.

52
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,951
I do. I wouId have recognized him.

53
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,748
You don't remember what he Iooks Iike.
I do.

54
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,086
This is a man who took off,
what, 30 years ago?

55
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,984
Why wouId he come back now,
at the very Iast minute?

56
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,831
(SIGHING)

57
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,362
I don't know.

58
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,535
REYNOLDS: Why is he stiII aIive?

59
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:15,133
It appears that some information
was anonymousIy sIipped to the judge.

60
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,606
AnonymousIy?

61
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,539
It was your fat IittIe friend, HaIe.

62
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,273
-If you had taken care of him sooner...
-It wasn't HaIe.

63
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,009
How do you know that?

64
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,948
If HaIe had given Veronica Donovan

65
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,917
anything that couId have
gotten a stay of execution,

66
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,387
I think she wouId have brought it up
when she made her argument in court.

67
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,719
It didn't come from him.

68
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,292
WeII, who eIse on your end knows?

69
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,022
Who eIse on your end knows?
Why aII the finger-pointing at us?

70
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,792
Are you sure that the Ieak didn't come
from your end? From the company?

71
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,198
Hey, we are aII
on the same team, remember?

72
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,367
AbsoIuteIy.

73
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,970
Just find the Ieak and pIug it.

74
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,612
Thank you, ma'am.

75
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,942
One more thing.

76
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,089
The next time you're in my office,

77
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,092
I expect you to stand
when you're addressing me.

78
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,956
AbsoIuteIy.

79
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,599
AII I can teII is
I was working Iate in chambers,

80
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,138
I Ieft at 1 1 :00,

81
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,907
and there it was, right under my door.

82
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,245
One is Terrence Steadman's
autopsy report.

83
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:31,077
In it, his appendix is noted
as present and unremarkabIe.

84
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,715
The other paper is an operative report

85
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,152
from when Mr. Steadman
was 12 years oId.

86
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,783
The procedure was an appendectomy.

87
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,619
That's impossibIe. Let me see this.

88
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,092
I want the conviction overturned

89
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,289
and LincoIn Burrows
immediateIy reIeased from custody.

90
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:49,164
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.
These records haven't even been certified.

91
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,530
The hospitaI can teII you.

92
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,128
The hospitaI does not keep records
going back that far. I checked.

93
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,332
So as far as we know,

94
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,842
these documents couId be a hoax
from some anti-death penaIty advocate

95
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,970
or, dare I say it, defense counseI.

96
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,707
Oh, pIease. You're preposterous.

97
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,079
Let's just aII
take a deep breath here, okay?

98
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,708
I don't know what these papers mean

99
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,344
and for that reason,
I'd Iike to err on the side of caution.

100
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,481
I'm going to deIay the execution
for two weeks.

101
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,187
That shouId give us more than enough
time to exhume the body.

102
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,891
Exhume the body.

103
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,956
Your Honor, aII due respect,
that is a drastic measure.

104
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,093
It's aIso the onIy way we're going to know

105
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,933
if that body in the ground
is reaIIy Terrence Steadman.

106
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,144
GUARD: (ON P.A. SYSTEM)
Recreation hour will be over in 10,,,

107
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,509
GUARD: (ON P.A. SYSTEM)
Recreation hour will be over in 10,,,

108
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,877
SCOFIELD: So that's not
Steadman that was buried?

109
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,347
VERONICA: We don"t know,

110
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,583
lf it isn"t, Lincoln"s free,

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,784
lf it is, we"re right back where we started,

112
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,754
Take care of yourself, Michael,

113
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,022
So, that body, what if it's him?

114
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,291
WeII, I'm not going to sit around hoping.

115
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,134
What does that mean?

116
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,103
It means we get back to work.

117
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,435
God, I was hoping you wouId say that.

118
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,167
They're digging up the body, huh?

119
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,472
To be honest, I've never been
in a situation Iike this before.

120
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,114
If nothing eIse, you can be gIad

121
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,984
that you've got peopIe who'II go
to extreme Iengths to get you out of here.

122
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,719
No kidding.

123
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,019
Warden,

124
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:29,033
at the execution,
there was a man in the viewing room.

125
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,335
Just wondering if you or anyone
in the prison had spoken to him.

126
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,365
WeII, according to this,

127
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:42,408
those present were your brother,
his attorney and three reporters,

128
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,440
two women and a man.

129
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,484
The man, who was he?

130
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,184
He was from The Headline Press,

131
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,953
WiIIiam PraII.

132
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,390
You know him?

133
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:56,962
No.

134
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,396
Guard.

135
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,944
HoId it steady, pIease.

136
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,481
What exactIy are you Iooking for
in aII that ink?

137
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,143
A new way out of here.

138
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,649
-You don't know those pIans by now?
-No.

139
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,658
Memorizing it wouId be Iike
memorizing the phone book.

140
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,423
Yeah, but why not just tat up Route 66?

141
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,221
Contingencies.

142
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,124
Contingencies?

143
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,230
-You saying you found another way?
-Maybe.

144
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,103
What do you mean, maybe?

145
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,474
There's aIways been another way,
but it's suicide.

146
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,178
(MEN CHATTERING)

147
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,849
Man, I'm so coId my hands are stinging.

148
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,827
You know what they say
about weather in the Midwest,

149
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,454
if you don't Iike it, wait an hour.

150
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,931
We're stiII going out through the infirmary

151
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,005
and we're stiII going to do it
from the guards' room.

152
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,630
It's just the in-between
that's gonna have to change.

153
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,709
Now wait a minute.
Why are you changing the pIan, man?

154
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,710
We're aIready through that room
beneath the infirmary.

155
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,280
That's aII we gotta do is get through
that pipe and we're home free.

156
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,179
There's a reason they repIaced it
with a 12-inch pipe, Darwin.

157
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,808
PeopIe can't get through it.

00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,649
The onIy way we're getting
into that infirmary is from beneath.

159
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,950
We're going to have to find another way.

160
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,019
The psych ward?

161
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,994
It's the onIy buiIding that shares
a subsurface Iine with the infirmary.

162
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,826
You teIIing me,

163
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:43,299
to get to the infirmary
we gotta go through the whack shack?

164
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,892
UnIess you got a better idea.

165
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,596
And there's a subsurface Iine

166
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,470
that runs from the guards' room
to the psych ward?

167
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,803
Sort of.

168
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,105
Oh, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean ''sort of''?

169
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,237
We can go into that hoIe
in the guards' room.

170
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:59,283
About 40 yards up Route 66, there's
a grate and that'II get us haIfway there.

171
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,949
-And what about the rest of the way?
-We gotta do it above ground.

172
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,250
Oh, so it's just a bunch of cons

173
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,155
taking a stroII in the middIe of the night
for aII the guards to see?

174
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,284
Yep.

175
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,025
You're right. It is suicide.

176
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,672
This grate that you're taIking about,
it's hidden, right, partner?

177
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,143
-The COs can't see it.
-Not exactIy.

Oh, heII no.

180
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,848
When we come up out of
that ground there, that tower there,

181
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,259
that tower there,

182
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,195
that tower behind me is gonna see us.

183

have been through what you just did.

it's possibIe that it was your subconscious
giving you what you wanted,

whoever it was that

you wanted to be there with you

What do you do?

318
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,764
Write them here
and then send them to a paI in Iraq

319
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,527
and have him maiI them your wife's way?

When they buiIt this pIace in 1858,
the pipes were Iead.

351
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,828
A century Iater,
they discovered Iead was a heaIth risk

352
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,922
so they went to copper.
They never removed the Iead pipes.

353
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,864
Cost too much.

354
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,436
There's thousands of yards
of the stuff stiII down there.

355
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,199
And then a few years ago,
they switched to industriaI pIastic.

356
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,333
Again, it was cheaper
just to Iay it over the oId stuff.

00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:24,295
What the heII am I gonna do now?
I'm a dead man.

470
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,632
I'm sorry, cuz. It was an accident.

471
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,497
BuII's gonna see this and fIip his Iid.

472
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,098
Hey, sIim ! You got my uni ready?

473
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,104
There's been a bit of a probIem, boss.

474
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:40,480
-What the heII is this?
-I Ieft the iron on it too Iong.

475
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:44,576
You are as stupid as you are fat,
do you know that, D-cups?

476
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,321
My new shirt's coming out of your kick.

477
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,428
-You're gonna teII me right now.
-TeII you what?

478
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,126
What the heII you got going on
that's got you burning up guard suits?

479
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,703
Trust me, primo,
The Iess you know, the better.

481
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,011
Any news?

482
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:19,251
No. No, not yet.
Testing takes a coupIe of days.

483
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,988
What do you remember of Dad?

484
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,654
Your dad? I didn't know him.

485
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:30,494
Your mom said some pretty horribIe stuff
about him when we were growing up.

486
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,399
I think I saw him when I was in the chair.

487
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:35,866
LincoIn.

488
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:39,003
It was him. I know it was.

489
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:43,436
How wouId you know?
You haven't seen his face in 30 years.

490
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,539
-The name that was used, WiIIie PraII.
-So?

491
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,312
It's the name of this guy
who threw for Chicago back in the day.

492
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,947
Dad and me were reaIIy into him
but I'd forgotten aII about him.

493
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,051
It's reaIIy weird.

494
00:39:56,694 --> 00:40:00,425
Been having these dreams, memories,
things I guess I suppressed when he Ieft.

495
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:01,623
But...

496
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:07,160
This man who came to the execution,
how do you know he used that name?

497
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:08,663
Pope toId me.

498
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,207
Was that before
or after you had the dream?

499
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,269
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

500
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,711
I don't mean to chaIIenge
what you're saying,

501
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,809
but your dad's been MIA
aImost your entire Iife.

502
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,615
I know what I saw, V.

503
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,156
I know what I saw.

(SIGHING)

505
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,426
This is the security camera footage
of the courthouse

506
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,696
from the night that Judge KessIer
got those documents.

507
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,397
Now, check out this guy.

508
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,902
He is very skiIIed.

509
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,041
He moves casuaIIy enough
to avoid suspicion.

510
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:53,105
You see how he shifts his hat
when he turns corners to hide his face?

511
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,085
He knows exactIy
where those cameras are.

512
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,855
Wait. Right there.

513
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,426
See that refIection? Rewind it. Rewind it.

514
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,160
Right. Can you bIow that up?

515
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,301
-Son of a bitch.
-What?

516
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,712
I know that guy.

517
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,185
What is it?

518
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,715
It was fused into MichaeI ScofieId's skin.

519
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,985
I removed it
during the d¨¦bridement procedure.

520
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,492
And what about it?

521
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,956
WeII, this fabric doesn't come
from a standard issue prison uniform.

522
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:45,001
-Where'd it come from then?
-As far as I can teII, a guard's uniform.
