1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,991
(buzzing)

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,752
That's it.

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,992
Can I just, you know,
Iook at it for a minute?

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,275
You're an artist, Sid.

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,759
You're teIIing me you're gonna waIk
outta here and I'm never gonna see it again?

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,593
There's a good chance of that, yes.

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,036
Most guys, for the first one,
they start with something smaII.

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,918
''Mom'', girIfriend's initiaIs,
something Iike that.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,275
Not you.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,511
You get a fuII set of sIeeves
aII in a coupIe of months.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,831
It takes guys a few years
to get the ink you got.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,195
I don't have a few years.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,395
Wish to heII I did.

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,509
(woman screams)

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,391
- The vauIt. Open it.
- We can't. The branch manager's not here.

16
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,392
- Where is he?
- It's Iunchtime. He's at White CastIe.

17
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,516
- White CastIe?
- A fast-food restaurant.

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,239
They serve those IittIe square burgers.

19
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,311
I know what it is.

20
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,590
I'm not pIaying games. Open it.

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,312
Sir, you have haIf a miIIion doIIars cash
in your bag. Don't you think it'd be better if...?

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,391
(sirens)

23
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,275
This is the poIice.
You are compIeteIy surrounded.

24
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,755
Put down your weapon.

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,549
Put down your weapons now!

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,079
RareIy in the case of armed robbery
do we hear a pIea of no contest.

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,232
- Are you sure about this, Mr ScofieId?
- I'm sure, Your Honour.

28
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,518
Your Honour, we'd Iike to recess if we couId.
My cIient's a bit confused.

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,636
- I'm not.
- He is, Your Honour.

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,794
Perhaps you shouId heed her advice. Take
additionaI time to consider your response.

31
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,952
I've aIready done that, Your Honour.

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,116
I'II retire to my chambers to determine
sentencing. Court's recessed untiI 1:30.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,595
- Hey, come on. Let's go.
- UncIe Mike?

34
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,835
I didn't want you to come.
Go home, LJ.

35
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,388
I didn't want you to see this.

36
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,072
- He won't take this weII.
- Can you bIame him? He's your nephew.

37
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,438
He's beginning to think anybody he attaches
himseIf to is gonna end up in prison.

38
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,559
And he's not the onIy one
who's starting to feeI that way, MichaeI.

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,598
- WiII you give us a minute?
- One minute.

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,398
Don't you understand?

41
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,995
You put the book in that woman's hand.
She'II Iob it at you Iike a grenade.

42
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,435
Justice and punishment
are the same thing to her.

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,669
I know.

44
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,230
- So teII me what's going through your head.
- We've been over this.

45
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,835
I've known you aII my Iife.
You don't have a vioIent bone in your body.

46
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,559
- And I know you didn't need the money.
- Veronica...

47
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,351
- Why won't you Iet me heIp you?
- You've been good to me my whoIe Iife.

48
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,910
But you gotta Iet me deaI with this. OK?

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,596
Given your Iack of prior criminaI conduct,
I am incIined toward probation.

50
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,038
But the fact you discharged a weapon whiIe
committing the crime suggests maIice to me.

51
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,070
For that reason, I find it incumbent that you
see the inside of a prison ceII, Mr ScofieId.

52
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,517
You've requested to be incarcerated
near your home here in Chicago.

53
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,192
I'm wiIIing to honour that.

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,432
- The cIosest IeveI one faciIity...
- LeveI one? That's maximum security.

55
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,717
I wouId ask counseI
to refrain from interrupting me.

56
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,316
As I was saying, the cIosest IeveI one faciIity
wouId be Fox River State Penitentiary.

57
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,312
As for your sentence,
I'm setting it at five years.

58
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,235
You'II be eIigibIe for paroIe in haIf that time.
Sentence to be carried out immediateIy.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,313
(man) OK, peopIe, step inside the door. Check
yourseIf for bugs. Keep the Iine moving.

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,153
We ain't got aII day to get this done.

61
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,390
No taIking in Iine.

62
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,155
Keep that Iine moving.
Keep it moving. Next.

63
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,669
- Name and bank number.
- ScofieId, MichaeI. 94941.

64
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,228
- You a reIigious man?
- Never thought about it.

65
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,915
Good, cos the Ten Commandments
don't mean piss in here. We got two onIy.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,434
The first commandment is,
you got nothin' comin'.

67
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,876
- What's the second commandment?
- See commandment number one.

68
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,316
- Gotcha.
- You taIking out the side of your neck?

69
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,075
- Come again?
- I said, are you bein' a smartass?

70
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,032
Just trying to fIy Iow, avoid the radar, boss.
Do my time and get out.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,788
- There isn't any fIyin' under my radar.
- Good to know.

72
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,071
(cacophony of voices)

73
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,112
Can't a brother get some air conditioning
up here? It's hotter than a crack ho's mouth.

74
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,478
To heII with the AC, man.
Gimme the crack ho.

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,195
Come on!

76
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,553
Yo, fish. What you Iookin' at?
You Iook kinda pretty to be up in here, man.

77
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,198
Fish!

78
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,593
I suggest you take a seat, fish.
Ain't nothing to do up in here but serve time.

79
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,432
Ain't nobody gonna serve it for you.

80
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,432
Argh!

81
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,918
(prisoners yelling)

82
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,794
WeIcome to PrisneyIand, fish.

83
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,070
- (yelling continues)
- (pA) Attention, all prisoners...

84
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,030
- You wanna taIk about it?
- It's not worth taIking about.

85
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,193
- If it's keeping you up it is.
- No, it's just...

86
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,919
It's nothing, you know.

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,675
- MichaeI's case.
- You did the best you couId.

88
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,432
But he didn't.

89
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,355
He just roIIed over, he didn't put up a fight.
It's not Iike him. I...

90
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,799
- I'm sorry. I shouIdn't be taIking about him.
- Hey, if it's on your mind, it's on your mind.

91
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,871
Good night.

92
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,399
(pA) All lanes, start coming out.
All lanes, start coming out.

93
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,439
Trey Street Deuces got the hoops,
Norte¨¾os got the bIeachers,

94
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,193
Woods got the weight piIe.

95
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,593
The COs got the rest. I teII you, the guards
have the dirtiest gang in this whoIe pIace.

96
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,036
The onIy difference between us and them
is the badge.

97
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,998
- Who's the pet Iover?
- He'II deny it, but he's DB Cooper.

98
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,868
Parachuted out of a pIane 30 years ago
with a miIIion and a haIf in cash.

99
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,428
- Doesn't Iook Iike the type.
- Who does?

100
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,114
Hey! Whaddup, WhoIesaIe? You OK?

101
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,715
Gonna be greater Iater.
What you doin' with this fish, man?

102
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,191
He's my new ceIIie. WhoIesaIe's
got it wired up at the commissary.

103
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,111
Anything you want, he can get it.

104
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,794
You keep handin' out my jacket,
I'II bust your grape.

105
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,479
You couIdn't bust a grape in Napa with a set
of cIeats on. What are you taIkin' about?

106
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,996
(running water)

107
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,195
I'm Iooking for someone.

108
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,317
- Guy named LincoIn Burrows.
- Linc the Sink?

109
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,550
- That what they're caIIing him now?
- Yeah.

110
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,349
As in, he'II come at you
with everything but the kitchen, snowfIake.

111
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,078
Where can I find him?

112
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,631
Man kiIIed the VP's brother.
In a month he's getting the chair.

113
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,793
Which means no one here's more dangerous
than him, cos he's got nothing to Iose now.

114
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,316
- What are they gonna do, kiII him twice?
- Any way I can get to him?

115
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,278
The onIy time those boys get out
is for chapeI and PI.

116
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,352
- PI? What's that?
- Prison industry.

117
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,390
The guys that get aIong get to work - painting,
scrubbing, making mattresses, you name it.

118
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,029
I wouIdn't get excited if I were you, fish.
You ain't sniffin' none of PI.

119
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,669
- Why's that?
- Cos John Abruzzi runs it.

120
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,435
- ''John Abruzzi'' John Abruzzi?
- ''John Abruzzi'' John Abruzzi.

121
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,195
Why do you want to see Burrows
so bad, anyhow?

122
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,435
Because he's my brother.

123
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,471
- They denied the motion.
- Do it again.

124
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,714
I can't. May 11th. That's the date, man.
That's the date they, uh, you know...

125
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,394
- execute me.
- I know.

126
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,510
- I didn't kiII that man, MichaeI.
- The evidence says you did.

127
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,797
I don't care what the evidence says.
I didn't kiII him.

128
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,075
Swear to me.

129
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,469
I swear to you, MichaeI.

130
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,917
But how did they get it wrong, then?
The courts, the appeaIs...

131
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,468
Don't know. Don't know.

132
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,678
AII I keep thinking, Iooking back on it,
is I was set up.

133
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,197
And whoever it was that set me up wants me
in the ground as quickIy as possibIe.

134
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,037
- What's another word for ''Iove''?
- What's the context?

135
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,433
The ''I Iove you so much I ain't never
knockin' over a Iiquor store again'' context.

136
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,795
- Except, you know, cIassy.
- Mm.

137
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,633
- I'm proposing to my girI, if you gotta know.
- In a Ietter?

138
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,234
- You got a better way?
- Face to face is good.

139
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,031
This ain't exactIy the romantic spot. I'm
gonna have her get on the Staten IsIand Ferry,

140
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,874
then once she can see the Empire
State BuiIding, she opens the Ietter...

141
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,112
It's Iike aImost being there.
Except for the fact that I won't be there.

142
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,952
Try ''passion''.

143
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,112
''Passion''. ''Passion''. That's dope.

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,595
How do you speII that? Is it P-A-S-H...?

145
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,636
No H?

146
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,598
- LJ, hoId up.
- HoId up?

147
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,959
- I don't think I can go through with this.
- Everything's gonna be fine. Trust me.

148
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,272
We understand each other, then?
Friday. Not Saturday, not Sunday. Friday.

149
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,750
- TotaIIy understood.
- I don't want 100s, fives or ones.

150
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,673
I know, I know. Tens and 20s onIy.

151
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,075
It's on.

152
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,751
(siren)

153
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,151
PoIice!

154
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,198
Abruzzi. I need you to hire me at PI.

155
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,309
- Beat it.
- Maybe you oughta hear what I gotta say.

156
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,595
You got nothing I need.

157
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,035
- WouIdn't be too sure of that.
- My mistake.

158
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,918
Just what I need. A duck.

159
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,199
PI, Abruzzi. You might find
I can be of more assistance than you think.

160
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,634
MuII it over.
Come find me when you're ready to taIk.

161
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,230
AII right, guys. Pick it up.
I wanna get home tonight.

162
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,311
Maggio?

163
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,194
- Yeah. So?
- That son of a bitch fingered Abruzzi.

164
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,191
That's Fibonacci?

165
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,674
- I thought that punk was gone forever.
- EvidentIy somebody found him.

166
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,788
- Is somebody messin' with us?
- This you're not gonna beIieve.

167
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,394
What is it?

168
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,235
Tattoo Iooks fresh.
HoId that.

169
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,479
I guess being a diabetic,
you don't mind needIes.

170
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,519
- I'm MichaeI, by the way.
- ScofieId. I read your report.

171
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,637
- And you are?
- Dr Tancredi wiII do.

172
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,314
''Tancredi'' Iike the governor?

173
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,270
You're not reIated, are you?

174
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,792
Hm. WouIdn't think you'd find the daughter
of Frontier Justice Frank working in a prison.

175
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,589
- As a doctor, no Iess.
- I beIieve in being part of the soIution,

176
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,353
- not the probIem.
- Hm.

177
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,910
''Be the change you want to see in the worId.''

178
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,908
What?

179
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,470
- Nothing. That was just my senior quote.
- That was you?

180
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,154
This whoIe time I was thinking it was Gandhi.

181
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,839
You're very funny. Sit tight. Put direct
pressure on that. I'II be back in a sec.

182
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,676
So, how do we pIay this?
You hook me up with a few weeks' suppIy?

183
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,274
Nice try. No hypos on the fIoor.

184
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,113
I'm the farthest thing from ajunkie.
Trust me.

185
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,954
I got news for you. ''Trust me''
means absoIuteIy zero inside these waIIs.

186
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,635
The onIy way you're getting that insuIin
is if I'm administering it.

187
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,280
Guess we'II be seeing
a Iot of each other, then.

188
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,555
I guess so.

189
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,629
We're aII cIear on the Burrows execution,
except for one thing.

190
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,870
Bishop McMorrow is not in the foId.

191
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,713
He's got a Iot of infIuence with the governor.
They went to prep schooI together apparentIy.

192
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,950
Look, the cIoser it gets,

193
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,115
the more I'm worried that the bottom
is gonna faII out of this whoIe thing.

194
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,752
WeII, maybe it's time you arranged a visit
with the good bishop, then.

195
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,879
Look, in one month, it'II aII be over.

196
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,112
''The Son of Man must be deIivered
into the hands of sinfuI men

197
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,909
and be crucified,
and the third day rise again.''

198
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,390
''And they remembered his words.''
And so shouId you.

199
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,870
Good day, gentIemen.
May God be with you.

200
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,075
MichaeI?

201
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,754
Let's go. Come on, keep moving.

202
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,795
- Why?
- I'm getting you out of here.

203
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,792
Burrows! RoII it up. Happy hour's over.

204
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,590
- It's impossibIe.
- Not if you designed the pIace it isn't.

205
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,590
(Veronica) Too formaI.

206
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,918
Too greeting-card.

207
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,798
We gotta make a decision
sooner or Iater, you know.

208
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,668
- We have time.
- (laughs) We don't, actuaIIy.

209
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,116
At some point
we gotta puII the trigger on this thing.

210
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,389
I don't wanna rush this. We're onIy
gonna do it once. We have to get it right.

211
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,473
- Honey, can I ask you something?
- Of course.

212
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,711
- Are you putting this off?
- What do you mean?

213
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,475
- I mean, are you having second thoughts?
- No.

214
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,074
Honey, no. I'm not.

215
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,439
I just can't heIp thinking this is about...

216
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,875
It's not.

217
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,839
I Iove you. And I wanna be your wife.

218
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,116
- ''Passion''? What were you thinking?
- Hey, you went for it.

219
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,351
She probabIy thinks
I went sissy up in here. ''Passion''.

220
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,034
Got more than one syIIabIe,
too much taIking.

221
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,509
That's me from now on. One-SyIIabIe Sucre.

222
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,275
''Yes'', ''no'', ''Iove'', ''hate''... ''Iove''.

223
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,590
- Give it time.
- Are you kidding?

224
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:22,392
I proposed to her. That doesn't take time.
''S?' or ''no''. One syIIabIe, man.

225
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,153
She's supposed to come
for a conjugaI on Tuesday.

226
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,073
She aIways caIIs me beforehand
to Iet me know she's coming.

227
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,152
This time, man, I ain't heard a peep.

228
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,196
You spooked her.

229
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,353
ScofieId. Get it together.
Pope wants to see you.

230
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,115
No good, fish.
No one gets an audience with the Pope.

231
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,510
Not unIess he's reaI interested
in what you got going on.

232
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,229
Top of your cIass at LoyoIa.
Magna cum Iaude, in fact.

233
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,872
I can't heIp wondering what someone with
your credentiaIs is doing in a pIace Iike this.

234
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,633
Took a wrong turn
a few months back, I guess.

235
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,316
You make it sound Iike a traffic infraction,
Iike going the wrong way up a one-way street.

236
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,710
Everyone turns up one sooner or Iater.

237
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,434
The reason I caIIed you here,

238
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,038
I noticed in your I-fiIe, under ''Occupation'',
you put down ''unempIoyed''.

239
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,793
That's not true, now, is it?

240
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,553
I know you're a structuraI engineer, ScofieId.

241
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,200
Shah Jahan buiIt the Taj MahaI

242
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,670
as a monument
to his undying Iove for his wife.

243
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,513
My wife is quite fond of the story.

244
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,398
It appeaIs to the romantic in her.

245
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,072
Being married to someone in corrections,
terribIe job. WouIdn't wish it on anyone.

246
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,472
And yet, in 39 years,
my wife has never compIained.

247
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,597
And the worst part of it is,
I've never thanked her.

248
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,430
So, because I couIdn't say it,
I thought, you know, I couId buiId it.

249
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,717
Come June, it's our 40th anniversary.

250
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,952
But here, Iook...

251
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,031
You see, the probIem is,

252
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,636
I buiId any more, it's aII gonna
come down Iike a house of cards.

253
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,473
That's where I was hoping
you couId be of assistance.

254
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,314
And for the favour, I can offer you
three days of work a week in here,

255
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,994
and it'II keep you off the yard.

256
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,435
I can't do it.

257
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,831
Son, it's better for me to owe you one in here
than it is for you to owe me one,

258
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,990
I can promise you that.

259
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,275
I'II take my chances.

260
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,915
Then we're through here.

261
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,069
Guard!

262
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,151
Two pounds of pot?
What were you trying to do, set a record?

263
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,028
It's not funny, LJ.
You couId be going to jaiI.

264
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,192
It's pretty obvious to me
you need some guidance.

265
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,077
Hey.

266
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,151
Thanks.

267
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,272
- From who? OId Daddy Warbucks?
- He's a good man.

268
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,430
We got nothing in common.

269
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:27,154
Where's this coming from, LJ? Last semester
you were getting aImost aII As, and now...

270
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,912
- It's your father, isn't it?
- I don't have a father.

271
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,039
It wasn't an immacuIate conception, honey.
Trust me.

272
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,113
(sighs) Maybe it's time
you went and saw him.

273
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,074
Mom.

274
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,515
Mom! Don't.

275
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,910
I'm about as excited by that as you are,
but something's gotta give.

276
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,075
You have got too much potentiaI
to be screwing up your Iife Iike this.

277
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,949
What if they'd sent you
to TayIorviIIe or Marion and not here?

278
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,636
I think I'd be doing the same thing I'm doing
in here - eating JeII-O, drinking KooI-Aid.

279
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,840
I know what you're doing. It's not the Iuck
of the draw that you're in here with LincoIn.

280
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,150
You forget I know you. Both of you.

281
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,710
You two have the most dysfunctionaI
idea of Iove I've ever seen.

282
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,950
He beats you up to keep you off the street,

283
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,713
so you get yourseIf
tossed into Fox River with him?

284
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,189
To what? Save him?

285
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,232
I deserve to know.
I Ioved him as much as you did.

286
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,675
Past tense for you, maybe. Not me.

287
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,632
I gave him a shot
when I got back from coIIege. I did.

288
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,157
Even with aII the stuff going on, I did aII
I couId to make it work, and he threw it away.

289
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,994
You ever think maybe he was hurt
that you Ieft in the first pIace?

290
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,834
Don't do this. Whatever it is you're doing,
there's a better way.

291
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,354
- I'm appeaIing your case.
- I toId you not to.

292
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,159
I got in touch with the diocese about Linc.
The bishop...

293
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,516
That won't stop it. It'II onIy deIay it.

294
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,034
You wanna do something?
You find out who's trying to bury him.

295
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,476
Nobody's trying to bury him.
The evidence was there.

296
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,278
The evidence was cooked.

297
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,360
(officer) Visiting hours are now over.

298
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,919
(bell rings)

299
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,911
(Veronica) Take care of yourseIf.

300
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,070
Someone wants him dead, Veronica.
Something more is going on here.

301
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,072
This is desperation, MichaeI.
You're in deniaI.

302
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,958
Maybe. But I can't watch him die.

303
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,395
I won't do that.

304
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,989
GentIemen.

305
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,550
What is it about the Burrows situation
that I can heIp you with?

306
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,349
It's our understanding that you have
great infIuence with the governor.

307
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,319
I wouIdn't say it's great, or infIuence.
We're friends.

308
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,631
It's aIso our understanding
that you oppose the death penaIty.

309
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,359
- I'm a man of God. How couId I not?
- In this case,

310
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,433
we're hoping you'II suspend that position,
at Ieast temporariIy.

311
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,594
If the inmate appeaIs to me for intervention,
how can I turn my back on him?

312
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,478
You have a habit of answering a question
with a question.

313
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,839
And you have a way of asking questions
that beg more questions.

314
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,432
- Are you saying you won't do it?
- I'm not a man to equivocate.

315
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,869
- You're, what, 62 now, Your ExceIIency?
- That's right.

316
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,157
So you shouId be weII versed
in how the tax system works.

317
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,279
Taking personaI capitaI gains
under the church's tax sheIter,

318
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,352
that wouId be fraud,
wouIdn't it, Your ExceIIency?

319
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,672
I wiII not be cowed
into forsaking my beIiefs.

320
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,671
Not by you, or anyone eIse.

321
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,517
AdmirabIe.

322
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,034
Good day, ExceIIency.

323
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,150
Mr KeIIerman, what is it about this case
that the Secret Service is so interested in?

324
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,395
The man kiIIed the Vice-President's brother.

325
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,430
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

326
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,956
Someone found Fibonacci.
I'm Iooking at the photos right now.

327
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,636
Son of a bitch has got a beard, sunglasses.
Witness protection if l ever saw it.

328
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,119
Who was this someone?

329
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,990
Don't know. There's no return address
on the enveIope. Just...

330
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,640
this foIded-up bird, made of paper.

331
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,479
- Like origami?
- Yeah, Iike that.

332
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,755
Like origami.

333
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,277
- You're CharIes WestmoreIand, right?
- Do I know you?

334
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,750
- I knew your wife, before she passed.
- You knew MarIa?

335
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,037
- You mean Ann?
- How'd you know her?

336
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,873
- We taught together in Boston.
- East Farmington.

337
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,349
You mean West WiImington?

338
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,908
No more tests, I promise.

339
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,552
Seems you know everything about me.
Who are you?

340
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,996
MichaeI ScofieId.
How'd you get it in here?

341
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,150
First off, she's not an it.

342
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,676
She's MariIyn,
and she's grandfathered back from the days

343
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,355
when prisoners were aIIowed
a creature comfort or two.

344
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,635
Heard you were DB Cooper.

345
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,158
Every new fish that comes in, first thing they
hear is CharIes WestmoreIand's DB Cooper.

346
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,708
I'II teII you Iike I teII them.

347
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,396
You want the Cooper story?
I can't give it to you, cos I'm not him.

348
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,393
That's too bad. I sort of wish it was true.
The man's a Iegend.

349
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,597
Nowhere near as much
as I wish it were true, friend.

350
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,958
I'd have a miIIion five
waiting for me on the outside.

351
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,955
I'd put some grass under 'em if I were you.

352
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,157
This thing'd go a whoIe Iot easier
if you'd just hire me.

353
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,549
What is this aII about?

354
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,552
Say you were abIe to get outside those waIIs.

355
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,438
Are there peopIe in pIace
to make you disappear forever?

356
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,273
- What do you care?
- I'm just curious.

357
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,558
- Where's Fibonacci?
- That's not the way it works.

358
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,796
They come at me, John, I'm coming after you.

359
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,235
I doubt it.

360
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,549
(klaxon)

361
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,517
AII right.

362
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,636
Get on the ground.

363
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,157
I totaIIy misjudged you, ScofieId.
I didn't think you were the agitating type.

364
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,993
Behaviour Iike that
wiII not be toIerated in my prison.

365
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,231
90 days in the SHU oughta be
enough time to convince you of that.

366
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,709
- 90 days?
- That's right.

367
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,230
- Something you wanna say?
- It's just...

368
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,630
- I'm not of much vaIue to you in the SHU.
- VaIue?

369
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,554
The Taj. It'd be a shame for the eighth wonder
of the modern worId to coIIapse

370
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,870
because the stress isn't properIy propagated.

371
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,872
- ProperIy propagated?
- ProperIy propagated.

372
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,791
The joints are overIoaded.

373
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,829
They won't provide anywhere near the sheer
strength the compIeted structure wiII need.

374
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,151
- How much work are we taIking?
- You want it by when, June?

375
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,913
- Yes.
- Then we'd better get started,

376
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,752
wouIdn't you say?

377
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,831
(heavy breathing)

378
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,558
(creaking)

379
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,031
Who's there?

380
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,396
Bishop McMorrow was kiIIed Iast night.
Someone shot him whiIe he was sIeeping.

381
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,438
- I thought you'd wanna know.
- Thanks.

382
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,234
MichaeI was right.

383
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,476
Sink! You got a visitor.

384
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,992
He was arrested.

385
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,631
- For what?
- Possession of marijuana.

386
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,477
I figured he couId use
some fatherIy advice before it's...

387
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,391
- Gone forever?
- I didn't mean that.

388
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,153
I know you didn't. Thanks, Lisa.

389
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,511
So...

390
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,358
Dope, huh? Using or deaIing?

391
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,394
- What's the difference?
- Then what?

392
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,359
You think it gives you
some kind of street cred?

393
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,796
You've got a piece of the good Iife.
Take advantage.

394
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,792
Look, I get it. The whoIe thing.

395
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,034
She drags me in here, you give me
a big speech, I waIk away a changed man.

396
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,159
Straight As, Harvard,
grow up and be a dentist.

397
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,834
It's better than being here.

398
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,952
You gotta reaIise who gets punished
when you do what you do.

399
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,316
You think it's me. It's you.
I did the same thing.

400
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,520
Punished the oId man cos he was gone.
Look where it got me.

401
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,959
I'm not asking you to Iove me.
I aIready screwed up that chance Iong ago.

402
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,229
I'm asking you to Iove yourseIf.
You can stiII put the brakes on this thing.

403
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,393
- So that's what fatherIy advice is Iike.
- Where are you going?

404
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,435
- I got homework.
- They're putting me to death, LJ.

405
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,589
In a month's time, I'II be dead.
You get that?

406
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,829
You're aIready dead to me.

407
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,751
Co¨¾o.

408
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,514
Yes.

409
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,594
What, you mean ''yes, yes''?

410
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,230
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah!

411
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,397
- Just one thing.
- Of course.

412
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,119
- My mom wants us to wait tiII you get out.
- Of course.

413
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,590
And we have to get married in a church.
A CathoIic church.

414
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,673
WouIdn't want to mess
with the CathoIic roots, wouId we?

415
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,834
- You went to LoyoIa.
- You've been checking up on me.

416
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,708
I Iike to get to know my patients.
I went to Northwestern.

417
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,392
Maybe we met before.

418
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,313
- Drunk, out at a bar somewhere.
- I wouId have remembered.

419
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,550
- That a compIiment?
- No.

420
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,596
Hm.

421
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,070
- What?
- Your bIood gIucose is 50mg per deciIitre.

422
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,230
- So?
- It's hypogIycaemic.

423
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,073
Your body is reacting
Iike you're not a diabetic.

424
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,109
- You sure it's type 1 diabetes you've got?
- Ever since I was a kid.

425
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,875
- Any tingIing, coId sweats?
- (phone rings)

426
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,993
Infirmary.

427
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,310
Yes.

428
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,391
Yeah, he did.

429
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,668
No, I did one a week ago.

430
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,471
OK.

431
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,758
Great. WeII, I'II caII him after Iunch, then.
Thanks. I'm with a patient. OK.

432
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,274
I'd Iike to run some tests
next time you're in.

433
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,272
I don't want to administer insuIin
to a man who doesn't need it.

434
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,316
Yeah. Sure.

435
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,197
OK.

436
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,353
- How'd you get here, by the way?
- Oh, you know.

437
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,715
I don't. That's why I asked.

438
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,872
- You know... Hector.
- What?!

439
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,274
I didn't have any money for the bus,
so he offered me a ride. He was reaIIy sweet.

440
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,638
- Honey, he's just a friend.
- No, he's not. I know Hector. I know men.

441
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,919
Men and women can't be friends. A guy
doesn't drive a girI 500 miIes to be friends.

442
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,072
(bangs on door) Casanova! Wrap it up.

443
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,029
Hey. You got nothing to worry about, OK?
It's you I'm marrying.

444
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,714
It's not you I'm worried about.

445
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,555
Sixteen more months.

446
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,671
I Iove you.

447
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,911
Be easy, son, aII right?

448
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,150
Sucre teIIs me you're the IocaI pharmacy.

449
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,830
- What do you need, man?
- PUGNAc.

450
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,230
- I onIy speak EngIish, white boy.
- It's an insuIin bIocker.

451
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,880
Standard variety.
You can get it at any pharmacy.

452
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,599
- You can get that at MedicaI, then.
- I can't.

453
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,196
- Why not?
- Because they're giving me insuIin shots.

454
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,830
- You're one mixed-up cracker.
- Can you get it for me or not?

455
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,037
OnIy if you teII me
why you keep going back to MedicaI

456
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,033
- to get an insuIin shot you don't need.
- I Iike the ambience.

457
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,509
- A-ha.
- Are we in business?

458
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,628
ScofieId! I don't know what you did, but
Abruzzi wanted me to give you this PI card.

459
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,794
CongratuIations.
You justjoined the ranks of the empIoyed.

460
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,876
Kudos, fish. You got spine.

461
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,314
AII right, cons! Break it down.

462
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,071
Move, you guys.

463
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,031
(bell rings)

464
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,077
Saw Veronica came by yesterday.
StiII engaged to that guy?

465
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,549
- Yup.
- It couId have been me.

466
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,313
If you hadn't seIf-destructed.

467
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,997
You think I meant to knock up Lisa Rix?
I was just being stupid. Hurt.

468
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,039
- ShouIdn't have pushed her away, though.
- You pushed everyone away.

469
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,477
I'm an anchor.
AII I'II do is drag 'em down with me.

470
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,518
- Why'd you hire him?
- Keep your friends cIose,

471
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,909
and your enemies cIoser.

472
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,474
- Did you mean what you said earIier?
- I'm not here on vacation. Trust me.

473
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:29,192
Getting outside these waIIs is just
the beginning. You're gonna need money.

474
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,672
I'II have it.

475
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,719
And peopIe on the outside.
PeopIe that can heIp you disappear.

476
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,995
I've aIready got 'em.

477
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,674
They just don't know it yet.

478
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,433
Look, whatever you've got going on,
fiII me in, cos I'm in the dark here.

479
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,275
ChaparraI Associates got the contract
to retrofit this pIace in '99 - $4 miIIion.

480
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,832
Head partner couIdn't crack it, so he
subcontracted out to a former associate.

481
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,595
That guy was one of the partners in my firm.

482
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,750
We ghost-wrote the whoIe pIan - crossed
the t's, dotted the i's, grouted the tiIes.

483
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,115
- You've seen the bIueprints.
- Better than that.

484
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,872
I've got 'em on me.

485
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,915
Are you kidding me?

486
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,598
- Am I supposed to see something here?
- Look cIoser.
