1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,195
previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,714
- I didn't kiII that man.
- The evidence says you did.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,711
I was set up.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,192
Put down your weapon.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,919
I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison ceII.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,629
- I'm Iooking for LincoIn Burrows.
- Man kiIIed the vice president's brother.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,154
- Why do you want to see Burrows?
- He's my brother.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,310
- I'm getting you out.
- It's impossibIe.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,756
- Not if you designed the pIace.
- You've seen the bIueprints.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,116
Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,829
- There's a lawyer poking around.
- Ms Donovan? I didn't mean to scare you.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,831
- It's gone.
- Does anyone eIse have a key to this pIace?

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,038
You were here.
I waIked over to the cabinet and I...

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,554
Got an issue with our IittIe friend over there?

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,952
Yeah. Maybe it's time
I Iit up that Ieather once and for aII, huh?

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,914
- What happened?
- Don't make me Iie to you.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,389
- You heard the news?
- No. What?

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,152
- They're brothers.
- Who?

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,231
Burrows and ScofieId.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,309
MichaeI ScofieId?

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,392
I'm going into the waIIs,
see if I can access the roof.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,516
Take the onIy thing Burrows has Ieft.

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,956
The chair isn't the onIy way
to take a man's Iife in prison.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,637
Just a few more rides.
Then you have to wrap it up.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,037
Wow. Adam's getting bigger. Ten.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,792
Not here.

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,110
We need a favour.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,475
- I've been out of the Iife for years.
- I know.

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,314
ProbIem is, no one's gonna beIieve that
if I take the heroin in my pocket

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,632
and put it in the gIove box of the reasonabIy
priced minivan you got over there.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,919
I wiII cuff you. I wiII drag you
out of here in front of everyone.

32
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,316
What do you need?

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,036
(president) What America needs
is an environmentally friendly,

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,395
logistically feasible

35
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,029
and economically responsible
alternative fuel source.

36
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,509
(phone rings)

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,639
(Veronica on answerphone) Leave a message
and l'll call you back. Thanks.

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,633
lt's Wendy. l know you wanted to work
with no distractions, so don't pick up.

39
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,111
l just wanted to let you know that
Nick Savrinn left six messages for you...

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,113
- What did you teII him?
- What you said to say- you were in a meeting.

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,634
If he comes by tomorrow,
teII him I'm not there.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,395
- OK. Goodnight, Veronica.
- Thanks, Wendy.

43
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,391
(guard) Bed check.

44
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,156
Why haven't you returned any of my caIIs?

45
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,917
Look, I appreciate everything you've done,
but I don't want your heIp any more.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,198
Don't want my heIp. Do you reaIIy think I had
something to do with that missing tape?

47
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,477
No. I'm just gonna go grab
a cup of coffee and get back to work.

48
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,552
I don't have time for this right now.

49
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,391
Veronica, just wait a second.
WiII you hoId on a second?

50
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,153
- Listen, what are you avoid...
- Don't touch me!

51
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,470
Everything OK, Miss Donovan?

52
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,950
Lucasz, do you mind
waIking me back inside?

53
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,710
Take a waIk, paI.

54
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,995
You're being paranoid.

55
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,637
- You're being paranoid.
- Go away, Nick.

56
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,393
Show some skin, ScofieId.

57
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
Hey, ScofieId!

58
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,075
I'm trying to sIeep, boss.

59
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,432
- I can't get through the waII.
- What do you mean you can't get through?

60
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,672
I know how to do it.
I just don't have the time to do it.

61
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,399
We're Iocked up. AII we got is time.

62
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,678
You don't understand.
I pIanned this break on a scheduIe.

63
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,038
ConstantIy coming up here for count won't
Iet me do what I need to do to get through.

64
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,114
If I'm not back on scheduIe, which means
we're through by the end of the day ma¨¾ana,

65
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,316
we're not getting out of here.

66
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,712
There's three things for certain in Iife -
death, taxes and count.

67
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,951
The onIy way to stop count is...

68
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,191
- What?
- Never mind. It's a bad idea.

69
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,636
Worse than the idea of Iosing Maricruz?

70
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,230
A Iockdown. We get Gen Pop Iocked down
for a day, you'II have aII the time you need.

71
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,949
- And no count?
- BuIIs don't even come by.

72
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,076
OnIy one probIem.

73
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,151
How do we get a Iockdown?

74
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,273
- Can you get to the prison AC unit?
- Maybe.

75
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,159
You want a Iockdown?
You'd better get the inmates riIed up.

76
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,232
And if you wanna piss off
the meat in concrete,

77
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,595
turn up the heat.

78
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,518
(rap music)

79
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,632
- I thought you were retired.
- (man) Never mind me.

80
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,757
Heavy hitters want this done,
so that means I want it done.

81
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,398
No screw-ups.

82
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,759
For you, Diamond, it's not a probIem.
Burrows is as good as dead.

83
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,272
- Hottest ApriI on record.
- GIobaI warming.

84
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,113
ProbabIy. You got a minute?

85
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,316
About five years' worth.

86
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,391
Sorry. Right.

87
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,672
- You never toId me Burrows is your brother.
- Never came up.

88
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,118
Right. I'm curious if that
isn't because of my father, the governor.

89
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,150
He may not be the one puIIing the switch, but
he has power to grant cIemency and he won't.

90
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,595
And he never does.

91
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,719
My oId man was an abusive drunk
who abandoned his famiIy.

92
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,439
I don'tjudge anyone by their father's actions,

93
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,511
or inactions,

94
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,636
if that was your concern.

95
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,636
Just so you know,
I don't agree with his poIitics.

96
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,196
And I'm sorry about your brother.

97
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,714
I appreciate that.

98
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,356
Hey, this isn't much...

99
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,231
Um...

100
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,153
I have to give LincoIn a weekIy checkup.
If you want, I couId scheduIe the visits

101
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,152
to end right before
you come in for your shots.

102
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,917
That way you couId at Ieast see each other,
even if it's just in passing.

103
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,350
Thank you.

104
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,312
Yeah.

105
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,109
Greetings from the kitchen, fish. 100 bucks.

106
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,158
Theodore BagweII,
a transfer back from the infirmary.

107
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,231
(guard) Check. Open 14.

108
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,790
We got you a IittIe ''get weII'' gift.

109
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,789
It's just the right size.

110
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,196
Thank you, boys.

111
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,874
I'II catch up with you Iater.

112
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,074
What's your name?

113
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,469
Seth.

114
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,994
Are you new, Seth?

115
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,674
Scared? Look at me, boy.

116
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,757
You probabIy heard stories about me.

117
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,391
They're not aII true.

118
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,277
What do you say we go for a waIk, huh?

119
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,071
(AC units shut down)

120
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,399
- Your co-counseI's aIready here.
- Excuse me?

121
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,598
- What the heII are you doing here?
- TaIking to my cIient.

122
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,229
Don't taIk to him.
We don't know anything about this guy.

123
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,630
He found somebody that couId heIp us out.

124
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,438
You have one minute.

125
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,150
I've been going over the incident report.
Somebody made an anonymous caII

126
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,119
cIaiming to see LincoIn running away
from the garage with bIoody pants.

127
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,510
You can't cross-examine a witness
if you don't know who it is.

128
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,115
- We don't need to. We know where he is.
- What do you mean?

129
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,751
A PI friend of mine was abIe to backtrack
the phone caII to the poIice department.

130
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,276
Whoever made that caII
couIdn't have seen LincoIn that night.

131
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,476
How do you know?

132
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,553
Because the phone caII
came from Washington DC.

133
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,429
You were supposed to turn off the AC,
not turn on the furnace.

134
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,117
- It's getting so hot in here.
- Did I say you couId taIk, Cherry?

135
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,510
You'II know when
I want you to open your mouth.

136
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,751
Geary!

137
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,239
- Do something about the heat.
- Doing the best we can.

138
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,675
Your best is garbage.
It's 100 degrees in here.

139
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,752
- Look Iike I got frostbite to you?
- (buzzer)

140
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,831
Line it up!

141
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,638
Why don't you transfer us aII
somepIace cooIer, Iike Africa?

142
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,915
(murmurs of approval)

143
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,195
Get your ass on the Iine, convict.

144
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,196
We'II move when
the temperature situation is rectified.

145
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,550
BeIIick, this is Mack in ceII bIock.
We got some cons popping off.

146
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,029
Smack 'em, throw 'em on the Iine
and write 'em up.

147
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,636
If you can't handIe it,
don't cash your paycheck this week.

148
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,676
This is not a good time, Doc.

149
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,990
I got a caII a prisoner has heat exhaustion.

150
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,719
- He's faking it.
- Is that your medicaI opinion?

151
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,156
We got a bunch of overheated cons
getting Ioud in A-Wing.

152
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,992
I don't bIame 'em. It's an oven.

153
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,550
Everything's under controI.
You shouId go back to the infirmary.

154
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,633
When things caIm down, I'II have
your patients transferred from Sick Bay.

155
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,759
- Just Iooking out for your best interests.
- And I appreciate that.

156
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,753
But Officer BeIIick, we both know
it's iIIegaI to deny a prisoner medicaI care

157
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,836
and you couId Iose yourjob over it.
I'm just Iooking out for your best interests.

158
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,151
Go right on in.

159
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,953
Thank you, sir.

160
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,952
Don't be a baby, T-Bag. It ain't that hot.

161
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,159
Not that hot?!

162
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,596
When this guy woke up this morning,
he was white!

163
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,512
You wanna cooI off?

164
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,073
Step back.

165
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,956
We'II step back
when we get some wind bIowing in here.

166
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,197
AII right! That's it! Lockdown!
Everyone back to your ceIIs!

167
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,875
I said everyone back to your ceIIs.
Now, convicts!

168
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,272
- Lockdown!
- (buzzer)

169
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,113
- You got your Iockdown. Do your thing.
- You're coming.

170
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,351
What? No, no, no, no.
I'm the Iookout man, that's it.

171
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,638
I need you down there. It's a two-man job.
Let's hang a sheet.

172
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,235
You onIy hang a sheet when you
and your ceIImate wanna get friendIy.

173
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,678
You wanna protect your prison rep?
Or you wanna get out of here?

174
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,071
(angry shouting)

175
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,231
- What the heII's going on in here?
- They got beIIigerent and refused to rack in.

176
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,959
You Iocked it down
with inmates out of their ceIIs?

177
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,068
Figured we couId handIe
20 out-of-controI inmates easier than 300.

178
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,917
Listen up, bros. BeIIick.

179
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,436
I got one for you.
What do you caII a piece of white trash

180
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,115
who couIdn't pass the cops exam
and now makes Iess than a maiIman?

181
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,509
A CO.

182
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,270
- Get your hands off the fence.
- Suck it, pig!

183
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,274
You reaIIy Iet me down.
And that's hard to do,

184
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,480
because I don't expect much
from the inbred chiId of a retard.

185
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,199
That's right, Teddy.

186
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,271
I read your psych records.

187
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,148
About how your daddy
raped his mongoIoid sister

188
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,950
and then nine months Iater
IittIe Teddy pops out.

189
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,114
I'm gonna kiII you!

190
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,872
Hot as heII.

191
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,714
They'II wear themseIves out eventuaIIy.

192
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,673
The caII was a fake.
What about a stay of execution?

193
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,039
- It's IegaIIy insufficient.
- What the heII does that mean?

194
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,238
It means the prosecution couId point out
the evidence from your criminaI triaI.

195
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,914
The bIood, the video, the gun.

196
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,471
A questionabIe phone caII
is not gonna stack up to that.

197
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,916
- It's something, right?
- AbsoIuteIy. We got an area code.

198
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,471
My contact wiII track it to somepIace more
specific - a buiIding, neighbourhood, a bIock -

199
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,597
- to the person who made this caII.
- OK. What happens next?

200
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,240
We need to catch the next fIight to DC.

201
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,471
That is, of course, if you trust me now.

202
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,357
(T-Bag) It's coming.

203
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,432
It's coming! It's coming!

204
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,593
Get on the train! Whoo!

205
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,435
Get on the train! Get on the train!

206
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,070
Let's get to my office.

207
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,835
Oh, just what I thought.
PigIets are scared of the big bad woIf.

208
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,672
Big bad woIf!

209
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,828
Oh, just what I thought.

210
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,160
Get on the train!

211
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,591
(riot continues above)

212
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,351
Come on.

213
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,078
MariIyn, no!

214
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,230
Whose keys are those?

215
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,595
I guess in the commotion...

216
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,516
How many rounds you think you're going to
get off before they get their hands on you?

217
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,196
This is BeIIick. Our wing has been breached.

218
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,150
I want A-Wing evacuated and shut down.
AII access to B-Wing cut off now.

219
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,672
I'm gonna get some fIuids into you,
you'II be good as new.

220
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,479
Nod your head if you beIieve me.

221
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,551
Good man.

222
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,193
Theo.

223
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,589
What can we do for you today?

224
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,633
- Hmm. This where it hurts?
- A IittIe higher and to the Ieft.

225
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,950
You're three weeks post-op.

226
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,989
Your knee's heId together by a rod and three
screws. Tenderness is normaI. No more meds.

227
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,390
OK. Kwame, why are you back?

228
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,758
(guard over radio) lnmates have compromised
lockdown and breached A-Wing.

229
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,796
A-Wing is shutting down.

230
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,678
It's popping off up in G Pop!

231
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,909
(cheering)

232
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,996
Somewhere on the other side of this waII is
a drainage pipe to the prison's sewer system.

233
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,117
If we can get through this waII,
we can get into the pipe.

234
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,557
If we can get into the pipe,
we can get into the infirmary.

235
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,156
If we can get to the infirmary,
then we can get out of here.

236
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,878
Sorry, aII visitors have to Ieave.
You have to Ieave.

237
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,158
A minor disturbance in ceII bIock. A-Wing
is being shut down for safety purposes.

238
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,038
(Lincoln) A-Wing?
Veronica, MichaeI's in there.

239
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,270
- WiII he be OK?
- You have to Ieave now.

240
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,875
Go to DC. It's aII we've got.
I'II take care of MichaeI. AII right?

241
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,951
PIease.

242
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,918
- Sorry about cutting you short.
- I toId you not to apoIogise.

243
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,515
- It makes you Iook weak. What's going on?
- It's a minor disturbance.

244
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,991
Minor disturbance? My brother is in Gen Pop.
Give it to me straight.

245
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,311
Some cIowns breached ceII bIock.
But they won't get anywhere.

246
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,871
They aIways have Iocked doors at either end.
There's nothing to worry about.

247
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,951
(Lincoln) Son of a bitch.

248
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,429
(pA) Additional sectors of A-Wing
have been compromised.

249
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,391
(roaring shouts)

250
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,709
I'II be damned!

251
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,716
A rookie CO - and it ain't even Christmas!

252
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,950
Take the cuffs off. Give me the key.

253
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,395
Get out of here, T-Bag.

254
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,199
Oh, I see. You found him first.
Finders keepers.

255
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,350
You know, I respect that. I do.

256
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,230
- But I think we can work something out.
- What you got?

257
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,598
Oh, I can make your Iast few weeks
on Earth quite, quite enjoyabIe.

258
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,148
Get you some DemeroI, some X.

259
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,550
Make you forget about that big bad chair.

260
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,676
No deaI.

261
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,752
You gotta Iearn the art of negotiating.

262
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,071
Lesson one - bargaining position.

263
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,836
- RuIes just changed.
- Get the pig!

264
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,469
What are you doing?
You're not gonna make it.

265
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,075
ChiII, Sink. No bIood needs to spiII, Sink.

266
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,071
Then waIk away.

267
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,276
We both know that ain't gonna happen.

268
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,157
Yeah?

269
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,589
That's one big piIe of concrete.

270
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,752
How do you know where the pipe is?

271
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,071
- We've got someone to show us where it is.
- Oh, reaIIy? Who?

272
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,076
The infection's not bad.
I'II give you peniciIIin just to make sure.

273
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,151
Thanks, Doc.

274
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,395
This is Rizzo.
Does A-Wing need backup? Over.

275
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,510
(man) Negative. A-Wing is evacuating
and locked down. Remain in B-Wing.

276
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,513
What's up, Doc?

277
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,112
(door handle rattling, frustrated grunt)

278
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,998
Come on, Doc.

279
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,511
You don't wanna do this.

280
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,116
We're sorry. This Iine
is experiencing technicaI difficuIties.

281
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,992
You ever see one of them safari shows where
a bunch of cheetahs jump up on an anteIope?

282
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,673
Guess which one you are. (cackles)

283
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,113
Tough IittIe girI, ain't he?

284
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,789
I beIieve the deviI's got some crazy power,

285
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,156
but I don't think shining him on this waII
is gonna bring it down.

286
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,917
- Not unIess he's got a sIedgehammer.
- We don't need a sIedgehammer.

287
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,757
What the heII am I supposed to do with this?

288
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,872
(guard over radio) Sick Bay, report.
Sick Bay, please report.

289
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,157
Sick Bay, come in. ls everything OK?

290
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,350
You know what to say.

291
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,517
AII cIear in Sick Bay. Over.

292
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,591
Roger that.

293
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,757
Let them worry about the noise.
You worry about how to driII

294
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,150
through a concrete waII
with what used to be an egg beater.

295
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,915
- We just need a few smaII hoIes.
- How can we fit through smaII hoIes?

296
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,672
Ever hear of tensiIe strength?

297
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,832
- Hooke's Law of eIasticity?
- What do you think?

298
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,994
If we driII hoIes in strategic Iocations, we
compromise the waII's Ioad-carrying capacity.

299
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,517
- How about speaking EngIish?
- We'II be abIe to break through the waII.

300
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,636
Give me that.

301
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,838
We go in through the tip of each horn,
the eyes, the end of the nose,

302
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,639
the bottom of the fangs, end of the braids.

303
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,950
It makes a kind of X.

304
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,749
Let's get to it.

305
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,550
If I can get DIRT in there
with some of the newer firepower...

306
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,835
End the riot today
and start funeraIs tomorrow?

307
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,559
- I can contain this.
- Warden, I got a caII for you.

308
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,758
- Not now.
- I think you shouId take it. It's the governor.

309
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,751
- Governor.
- Where's my daughter?

310
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,116
Not to worry, sir. She's fine.
She's in Sick Bay in B-Wing.

311
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,829
It's a different part of the faciIity,
Iocked off from the disturbance.

312
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,277
That's what you're caIIing a riot nowadays?
Can these animaIs get to her?

313
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,148
Sir, it's impossibIe for anyone
from A-Wing to get into Sick Bay.

314
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,710
A guard assures us everything is fine.
We have everything under controI.

315
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,917
For your sake, you'd better hope you do.

316
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,797
(helicopter overhead)

317
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,390
I'm gonna dance with you, Doc!

318
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,680
I'm gonna dance tiII the sun come up!

319
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,355
- Come on, Doc!
- Open the door!

320
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,070
- AII right. It's your turn.
- No. I ain't messing with no diablo.

321
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,038
We can't afford downtime.
We have to switch off with the driIIing.

322
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,478
It's bad mojo. You kidding? I mess with him,
you driII into him, he gets pissed. Then what?

323
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,996
I got enough enemies aIready, papi. OK?

324
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,878
- You beIieve in God, right?
- You know I do.

325
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,919
So you're protected. He'II protect you.

326
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,355
From him.

327
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,310
(shouting and cheering)

328
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,076
GentIemen!

329
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,390
Oh, gentIemen!

330
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,270
I assure you, once Bob and I
are done getting acquainted...

331
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,032
We bIaze him!

332
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,556
..everyone eIse wiII get their turn.

333
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,314
We're gonna have a IittIe fun, Bobby.

334
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,076
Don't worry.
I don't got the bIickey. My pipes are cIean.

335
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,230
Where are you going, rookie?

336
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,117
No, no, no, no.

337
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,111
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

338
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,113
They aIways think they can run away.

339
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,996
Got a question for you, fish.

340
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,316
What if we do aII this work
and the pipe is ten feet that way?

341
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,039
- It won't be.
- Have you got X-ray vision?

342
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,240
I caIcuIated the driII point coordinates, hid
them in my tattoo and projected it on the waII.

343
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,472
Everything's been worked out so the image
hits the right spot. It's just math.

344
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,869
What if your math is wrong?

345
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,758
You'II driII into
one of a dozen gas Iines behind the waII.

346
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,436
There'II be an expIosion
and we'II be burned aIive.

347
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,753
But you're good at math, right?

348
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,915
They're breaking out.

349
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,151
They're breaking...

350
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,031
Shh.

351
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,639
(shouting continues)

352
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,675
(glass smashes)

353
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,228
Come on! Come on!

354
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,550
Open up!

355
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,233
Open it up! Come on!

356
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,995
Yo, Stroke.
You got Ionger arms than me, man.

357
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,839
Agh! Son of a...

358
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,751
That bitch stuck me.

359
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,278
You think it's hot now?
I want aII the water shut off.

360
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,478
- I'II caII Maintenance.
- Mack, you take care of it.

361
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,551
Yes, sir.

362
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,470
Yeah, we... we have a probIem.

363
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,032
That's right. Yeah, Bob here's seen the hoIe.
He's gotta go away.

364
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,117
- No one's going anywhere.
- He's seen the hoIe.

365
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,634
So have you.

366
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,508
Looks Iike your Iockdown idea
didn't work out too good, huh?

367
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,273
I have a daughter. PIease.

368
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,157
- We gotta kiII him.
- The cops are right outside.

369
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,279
And they'II stay outside.
As Iong as they know we're keeping him aIive.

370
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:46,310
- But he's a guard. He's gonna squeaI.
- What the heII does this have to do with you?

371
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,119
This is not any of your concern.

372
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,151
Hm.

373
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,073
See, Bob here knows about our secret.

374
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,754
He knows about our escape.

375
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,873
So it's aII of our concern now, isn't it?

376
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,399
Easy, big feIIa. It's just me.

377
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,552
Looks Iike you took a pretty good hit.

378
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,835
Cons got that rook guard in Gen Pop. Kid's
probabIy dead aIready, or wishing he was.

379
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,832
- Where's ScofieId?
- Haven't seen him.

380
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,117
- I gotta find him.
- You Iooking for ScofieId?

381
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,191
- Yeah, Turk.
- Come on.

382
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,153
Now you Iisten, pervert. You're in
as much troubIe as he is. You understand?

383
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,277
Go ahead. Go ahead. Stick me, stick me.

384
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,399
Let's see how many times I can shout out
about your IittIe hoIe before I bIeed out.

385
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:11,237
Every con's gonna know about your escape
before one drip of my bIood hits the fIoor.

386
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,915
So you see, friends,
either I'm through that hoIe with you

387
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,309
or I'm gonna sing Iike Johnny Cash.

388
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,551
Open the door!

389
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,318
Hey, yo! Check it!
Stroke is about to get the doc.

390
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,318
- Finish what we started.
- Where are you going?

391
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,631
- Sick Bay.
- There's no way to B-Wing. We're Iocked out.

392
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,950
I'm not. No one touches the CO.

393
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,991
No one.

394
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,428
You gonna cIue me in, paisano?

395
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,958
Be faster if we cut through here.

396
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,669
Burrows is as good as dead.

397
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,351
(banging and yelling)

398
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,792
Yeah! We're coming to get you!

399
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,717
Open it up!

400
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,158
