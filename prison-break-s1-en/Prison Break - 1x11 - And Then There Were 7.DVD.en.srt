1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,036
previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,430
We're through the hard part.
Another 18 inches, we'II hit that pipe.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,669
We'II be there by Friday.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,919
Now, we got a heII of a Iot
to taIk about, don't we?

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,756
- This guy says he's on the job in here.
- Concrete is my speciaIity.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,717
OK, boss. Sign him up.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,635
Whites don't want you, bIacks don't want you.
You're just caught in the middIe, aren't you?

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,438
A reguIar tweener.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,988
- HeIIo?
- It's me. It's time.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,876
Yes.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,598
Why are you so cynicaI?

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,114
I think there's cynicism
and then there's reaIism.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,555
And there's optimism. Hope. Faith.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,870
Thank you for trying to make me smiIe.
Not today.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,591
(Michael) You never know.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,069
You want the Cooper story?
I can't give it to you.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,354
Cos I'm not him.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,000
The Iawyers, they're stiII running around.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,595
Same thing goes for the kid.
You gotta hand the reins over to me. Now.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,113
First of aII...

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,158
You and your partner
are off the job untiI further notice.

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,351
(alarm beeps)

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,431
(turns on tap)

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,433
- (Michael) That one.
- (man) Nice choice.

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,080
PIatinum. Brushed.

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,799
- 6.25?
- 6.25.

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,075
She's a Iucky woman.

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,752
Yes.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,037
She is.

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,712
- You kept it.
- Kept what?

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,396
- The fIower.
- I'm a pack rat. I never throw anything out.

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,836
Yeah. AII this cIutter, it's overwheIming.

33
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,874
- You shouId see my apartment.
- Whoa.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,158
Haven't even had our first date yet,
and you're aIready inviting me in.

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,951
- I thought you were a nice girI.
- MichaeI, we aII know nice girIs finish Iast.

36
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,110
So where do you finish?

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,953
That depends on where I start.
Deep breath.

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,631
ExhaIe.

39
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,871
InhaIe.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,556
Sara, we're backing up out here.

41
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,279
Right. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,675
I'm gonna get your shot.

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,109
This is not what I signed on for.

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,634
What do you want us to do?
Wave the white fIag?

45
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,712
- I just want to get LincoIn off death row.
- LincoIn?

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,430
Vice President ReynoIds funneIIed miIIions
of doIIars into her brother's company.

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,355
That money was fiItered into smaII accounts
that made smaII donations to her campaign,

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,874
setting her up to be
the Ieader of the Free WorId.

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,554
This doesn't end
with us stopping an execution.

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,108
(Veronica) For me it does.

51
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,989
OK. Let's rotate.

52
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,640
Sergeant Sodomy, you're up next.

53
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,039
Yo.

54
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,990
- Come on.
- I don't know about y'aII, but...

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,152
This room is getting
a IittIe too dark for me to dig.

56
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,917
Are you teIIing me that there's a hoIe
in Fox River that you don't want to get into?

57
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,431
Hey. No one gets hurt.

58
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,748
Hey, you know, I got a question.

59
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,832
Now, how come FusiIIi over here
ain't grabbing a shoveI?

60
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,911
I handIe arrangements on the outside.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,389
ReaIIy? What is that?
Transport, paper, what?

62
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,516
ExactIy. Makes me manager.

63
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,469
- And that makes us just Iabour, right?
- Mm-hm. Now you're getting it.

64
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,672
You know, management better keep
a cIose eye on the conditions up in here.

65
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,751
Or the Iabour's IiabIe to go on strike.

66
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,594
- Get back to work.
- Whoa, CO coming.

67
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,950
(Sucre) Hurry, you guys.

68
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,231
Come on, cover it up.

69
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,155
Put that back up there.

70
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,030
ScofieId. Move it.

71
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,270
It's time for your conjugaI.

72
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,195
Your wife is here.

73
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,233
So you're Mrs ScofieId?

74
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,788
Ever done this before?

75
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,030
Had a conjugaI, I mean.

76
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,155
(woman) No.

77
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,518
Don't worry,
I'm just trying to make conversation.

78
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,151
CIear.

79
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,350
She Iook famiIiar to you?

80
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,431
No, Captain.

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,313
I know her from somewhere.

82
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,032
You came.

83
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,190
Of course.

84
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,910
- How've you been?
- Fine. I found ajob.

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,195
Good. I'm gIad.

86
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,559
Is it awfuI, being here?

87
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,475
Remember the first pIace you stayed?
That hoteI, by the airport?

88
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,836
OnIy difference is $69 and the free shampoo.

89
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,831
AIways the brave face.

90
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,590
You're stiII wearing it.

91
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,069
Every day.

92
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,037
I worry about you.

93
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,792
Don't.

94
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,997
Is there anything eIse that I can do?

95
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,038
Just what we agreed on.

96
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,954
I was so nervous when they were checking.

97
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,508
One question.

98
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,910
Why wouId you need a credit card in prison?

99
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,151
The riot didn't change anything.
Have you seen the budget cuts?

100
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,471
- Another 10¡ã/¡£ from heaIthcare.
- And 35 from prevention.

101
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,630
He's the governor, but aIso your father.

102
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,350
Maybe he thinks if he cuts enough,
they can't afford you.

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,438
(Michael) Thank you.

104
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,318
You understand this is standard procedure
foIIowing a conjugaI, right?

105
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,391
Never can be too carefuI.

106
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,675
AII right. Bend over.

107
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,915
You have a good time
in the romper room with that Euro?

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,468
Whatever you say, boss.

109
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,869
- She come around here before?
- First time.

110
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,034
You sure? Cos damn
if I don't recognise her from somewhere.

111
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,318
Maybe she visits some other con.
KiIIing two birds with one bone.

112
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,756
- Catching my drift?
- I wouIdn't know.

113
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,990
AII right. He's cIear, Captain.

114
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,110
Make sure you take a shower, ScofieId. You
never know what some women can give you.

115
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,073
# Swing Iow, sweet chariot

116
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,749
# Coming for to carry me home

117
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,439
# Swing Iow

118
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,511
You know this one, don't you?

119
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,036
# Sweet chariot

120
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,680
# Coming for to carry me home

121
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,833
Come on, gimme something.
I thought you was a musicaI peopIe.

122
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,071
You know, your parents
must be so proud of you, man.

123
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,310
Hitting the traiIer park trifecta.

124
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,632
You're a racist, a paedophiIe, and stupid.

125
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,793
You know, it vexes me that I'm made out
to be the bad guy in the room.

126
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,633
Y'aII ain't here
for steaIing GirI Scout cookies.

127
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,633
None of us murdered
any GirI Scouts in the process.

128
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,836
MichaeI's coming back from the boneyard.

129
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,388
AIone, aIone.

130
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,798
I teII you aII about me,
you don't teII me you're married?

131
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,438
Later.

132
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,436
(C-Note) Rough day, huh, ScofieId?

133
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,910
WhiIe the rest of us
are in here sIinging concrete,

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,516
you got some IittIe girI in
to pIay on your rusty trombone, huh?

135
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,990
Man's got a point.
Itjust doesn't seem equitabIe, Iike.

136
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,359
- Shut up and dig, T-Bag.
- (Abruzzi) What the idiots want to know is,

137
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,750
whiIe we're digging this hoIe,
what are you doing?

138
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,039
I'm going shopping.

139
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,071
(Sucre) We're good.

140
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,151
AII cIear.

141
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,319
Credit card? The buIIs catch you with that,
they'II be so far up your doggy door...

142
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,075
Don't worry.
They won't be catching me with one.

143
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,628
- How you so sure?
- Because...

144
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,472
I don't have a credit card.

145
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,791
(thud)

146
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,279
- Nick?
- (knocking)

147
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,158
(Quinn) HeIp! PIease...

148
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,075
- PIease, I had an accident, my car is totaIIed.
- (knocking)

149
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,038
Is there anybody there?

150
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,918
- We can'tjust ignore him.
- The heII we can't.

151
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,434
(Quinn) HeIp me. PIease!

152
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,954
HeIp me, pIease.

153
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,189
Ow! God!

154
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,268
- (Nick) What happened?
- I must've dozed off.

155
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,510
I've been driving for 12 hours.

156
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,036
- ShouId I get some water from the weII?
- No, the weII's dried up.

157
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,749
I think there's a medicaI kit over here.

158
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,153
No one's going anywhere.

159
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,477
- AII right. Say goodbye to Junior.
- (muffled yell)

160
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,596
(muffled cry)

161
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,270
You know how many pints of bIood
the human body has?

162
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,750
The answer is ten. Ten pints.

163
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,150
How many you think Prince Charming
over there on the fIoor has Ieft?

164
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,549
Eight, going on seven?

165
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,992
I'm gonna take him out to the woodshed,
have a IittIe taIk.

166
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,629
In the meantime,
I want you to chew on this.

167
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,033
You teII me everything about the Burrows
case, and who eIse you've toId about it,

168
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,389
and there's a chance that I might Iet you go
in time to get Mr Savrinn to a doctor.

169
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,318
You decide whose Iife is more vaIuabIe.

170
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,952
The guy waiting to die on death row, or the
guy wishing he'd die out in the woodshed.

171
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,992
One suit, black.

172
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,439
One pair of socks, black.

173
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,397
One pair of shoes. Shoelaces.

174
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,632
One small tape recorder.

175
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,792
One gold watch.

176
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,915
You ever stayed at a fancy hoteI, LJ?

177
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,514
You Ieave your room in the morning,
it's a mess.

178
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,515
Wet dirty toweIs on the bathroom fIoor, Iast
night's room service stinking to high heaven.

179
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,594
Then, you come back at night, it's aII gone.

180
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,069
Fresh toweIs, sheets,
candy on the piIIow.

181
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,152
It's just the best feeIing in the whoIe worId.

182
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,439
Cos someone eIse cIeaned up your mess.
AII you had to do was waIk away.

183
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,353
- Don't you hurt them.
- OK.

184
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,955
But you gotta teII me exactIy what they know
and who eIse they've toId,

185
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,429
and nobody has to die tonight.

186
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,310
You just waIk away.
Let me cIean up your mess.

187
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,552
I don't know what's going on.
I swear to God.

188
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,712
WeII, I wish I couId beIieve that.

189
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,197
- BeIIick assigned me a new ceIImate.
- Who'd you get?

190
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,956
Some new fish.
Ran a bump and swipe on an off-duty cop.

191
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,951
Fast hands, faster mouth.

192
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,918
- Yo, what's cracking, my peopIes?
- Speak of the deviI.

193
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,356
- MichaeI ScofieId, David ApoIskis.
- S'up?

194
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,910
I seen you before, right?
You're part of that PI crew.

195
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,869
Maybe you can hook me up. Brother needs to
make some green, some cashish, you know?

196
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,636
- The pay is 19 cents an hour.
- 19 cents? That's sIavery, yo.

197
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,555
That's prison, yo.
And besides, PI's aII fuII up for now.

198
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,035
AII right. I feeI you.

199
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,157
But keep a brother in mind,
if something opens up, yo.

200
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,109
HeII, I'II pay 19 cents an hour
to get me some more time out of the bIock.

201
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,354
Like having another kid.
AIready raised one. I'm too oId to do it again.

202
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,238
You ever hear of anything
being stoIen from R&D?

203
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,676
Of course.
BuIIs steaI from personaIs aII the time.

204
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,673
ProbIem is, you never know what's gone
untiI you're outside of the waIIs.

205
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,197
- At that point, you can't do anything about it.
- What if you knew now?

206
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,592
Look, I toId you. Leave me out
of whatever it is you've got going.

207
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,070
I just need to know
if you've seen a guard with a goId watch.

208
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,311
There's a Iot of peopIe
can get you a goId watch in here.

209
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,234
- Yeah, but I need this specific goId watch.
- (Lewis) WestmoreIand.

210
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,756
Pope wants to see you. Let's go.

211
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,760
Look, I haven't seen nothing.

212
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,994
But there is this one CO.
Word is he's the worst thief in here.

213
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,794
My wife faxed this over
from County Records.

214
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,714
Copy of ScofieId's marriage Iicence.
She says you owe her, big time.

215
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,110
Looks Iegit. He wasn't trying
to sneak in some whore for a conjugaI.

216
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,636
Says here they got married
the day before ScofieId robbed that bank.

217
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,792
Why the heII wouId he do that?

218
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,719
- Heard from Veronica?
- No.

219
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,631
(Lincoln) Just a note from LJ
saying he was with her, he's safe.

220
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,033
But it's been a whiIe.
Doesn't feeI right. FeeIs wrong.

221
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,395
- I gotta go.
- ReaIIy wrong.

222
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,959
(guard) I'II see you.

223
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,674
(Quinn) I, uh... I've come to a reaIisation.

224
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,797
Either Ms Donovan and that boy
don't Iike you very much,

225
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,635
or they have an unreasonabIe amount of faith
in your cardiovascuIar system.

226
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,870
So teII me, Nick.

227
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,476
This aII you got? This paper traiI
of an indictment that never even happened?

228
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,913
Is this it?

229
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,312
We know you don't have a surveiIIance tape
any more, you have nobody to testify.

230
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,198
So is this reaIIy aII you've got?

231
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,998
Mr Savrinn, that buIIet
went through your teres major,

232
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,870
ripped the IateraI margin of your scapuIa,
Ieaving you no mediaI rotation of your arm.

233
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,032
So if you try to swing
that piece of Iumber at me...

234
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,633
Argh!

235
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,510
It's gonna feeI Iike
your arm is ripping out of its socket.

236
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,711
Come on, Nick. Mr Project Justice.

237
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,553
We both know why
you're reaIIy here, don't we?

238
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,189
And it ain't to save LincoIn Burrows' Iife.

239
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,148
(pA) All prisoners, 15 minutes of walk time.

240
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,438
(raps) # Inside these waIIs,
I creep and I crawI, Iooking for a way out

241
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,750
# But I know there's gonna be no easy route

242
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,150
# This is gonna be a 12-round...
12-round bout

243
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,793
- # BeIIick and T-Bag on my mind
- (Michael clears throat)

244
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,269
# This grind in here...

245
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,240
You stiII interested in getting in on PI?

246
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,959
- Does my momma got big breastices?
- I wouIdn't know.

247
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,112
HeII, yeah, she does. And heII, yeah, I do.

248
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,274
AII right, Iook. I need a favour. Word is
you made your trade as a snatch and grab.

249
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,270
That's right.

250
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,636
I need you to steaI something back
that was stoIen from me.

251
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,029
- What kind of something?
- Just a watch.

252
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,112
Uh-uh. There ain't no such thing
as just a watch.

253
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,795
Every design has a different cIasp,
every cIasp has a different swipe.

254
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,237
It's ItaIian. A Remedi.
GoId band, pearI face, aII-weather.

255
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,038
- What year?
- 2003.

256
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,476
- That's a butterfIy cIasp on that bitch.
- Which means what?

257
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:55,317
Hidden depIoyment. There ain't no way
to snatch it without the mark feeIing it.

258
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,115
Which just means I'm gonna
have to get whimsicaI on this ficky.

259
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,193
I get you this watch,
that means I get in on some PI?

260
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,192
It means I'II think about it. No promises.

261
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,238
Why you need this watch so bad, anyway?

262
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,869
Let's just say it means a Iot
to someone in my famiIy.

263
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,752
Come in, CharIes. Sit down.

264
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,110
What's going on?

265
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,393
I've got some bad news, CharIes.

266
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,233
Your daughter is very sick.

267
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,629
She's got oesophageaI cancer.

268
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,395
Now, she's at Sacred Heart, in IndianapoIis,

269
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,314
and she wants to see you
whiIe there's stiII time.

270
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,118
How much time?

271
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,270
Doctors say a few weeks.

272
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,751
The probIem is, the DOC isn't gonna
Iet you go. They think you're stiII a fIight risk.

273
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,515
- She's my onIy chiId.
- I know that.

274
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,956
BeIieve me, CharIes,
I've Iobbied on your behaIf.

275
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,600
It's state poIicy.

276
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,514
They wiII onIy extend furIoughs
in the case of funeraIs.

277
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:28,798
You're teIIing me I have to wait
untiI she dies before I see her?

278
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,390
Mr ScofieId. Looks Iike
I'II be administering your shot today.

279
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,517
- Where's Dr Tancredi?
- We've got a busy scheduIe today.

280
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,909
- She's with another patient.
- (shouting)

281
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,673
(guard) HoId his Iegs! HoId his Iegs down!

282
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,513
- Hey, we need a doctor here!
- What happened?

283
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,832
The kid was in chow, aII of a sudden
he coIIapsed and started spitting up his food.

284
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,388
Looks Iike some kind of seizure.
Get him up here.

285
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,948
Get him up here,
make sure he doesn't hurt himseIf.

286
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,713
I'II need O2 and cardio from you.

287
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,317
HoId him. HoId him!

288
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,271
(door opens)

289
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,556
So, Ms Donovan.

290
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,758
How is that background in reaI estate Iaw
going for you? Is it a big heIp?

291
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,829
Hm?

292
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,230
WeII, frankIy I think we caught a break.

293
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,629
If LincoIn had naiIed a girI with haIf a brain,

294
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,554
she probabIy wouId have
brought this whoIe thing down aIready.

295
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,440
But you know what the worst part is?

296
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,150
You dragged these peopIe into this knowing
that you had no cIue how to get them out.

297
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,472
I mean, if you had just minded your own
business, peopIe Iike Leticia Barris,

298
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,028
she wouIdn't have
a mouthfuI of maggots now.

299
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,680
Your fianc¨¦ wouId not
be Iying in his apartment

300
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,196
waiting for the smeII of his rotting corpse
to Iet the neighbours know

301
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,635
that something had gone horribIy wrong.

302
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,757
That's right. Their deaths are on your head.

303
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,958
You made this mess. Nobody eIse. You.

304
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,353
But you are aIso the one person
that can end it aII right here.

305
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,796
AII I need to know
is who eIse you've invoIved.

306
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,078
So you just nod,
and I'II know you're ready to taIk.

307
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,839
Whew.

308
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,240
You know, Ms Donovan,
I think that you Iook a IittIe coId.

309
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,398
Maybe you'II find it easier to taIk
after you've warmed up a IittIe...

310
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,073
Where is he? What happened?

311
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,311
We gotta move.
Come on, we don't have time. Come on.

312
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,994
Come on. We're getting out of here.

313
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,753
- Where are the keys?
- Pocket. Left.

314
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,354
- Start the car.
- Is he gonna be aII right?

315
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,910
Go start the car, LJ.
Come on. We're gonna get you to a hospitaI.

316
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,709
Come on!

317
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,513
A gift from my ceIImate.

318
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,194
Thank you. And thank him.

319
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,876
The watch. What's it for, anyway?

320
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,269
Thought you didn't want to know about this.

321
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,318
Things have changed. I want in.

322
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,309
- Why the sudden change of heart?
- I have my reasons.

323
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,077
Don't take this the wrong way, but everyone
who's in is bringing something to the tabIe.

324
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,196
- How about money?
- How much?

325
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,793
I think you know.

326
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,555
I remember severaI conversations
that ended with ''I am not DB Cooper''.

327
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,119
- I Iied.
- You Iied.

328
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,509
We're cons. We tend to do that.

329
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,591
I checked your aIibi.

330
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,958
According to records, you were incarcerated
at the time of the Cooper hijacking.

331
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,875
My father and I share more
than just a weakness for easy money.

332
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,473
We aIso share a name.

333
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,429
CharIes WestmoreIand Senior
was the one Iocked up that day.

334
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,957
- Now, do you want the money or not?
- No offence, but it's a IittIe convenient.

335
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,953
You want in, and suddenIy you're the guy.
How do I know you're not Iying now?

336
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,474
(guard) Hey, OId Man River. Keep it moving.

337
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,231
Hey, Sucre.

338
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,838
I got a question about you
and the rest of the Mexicans.

339
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,515
I don't think I'II be abIe to heIp.
Seeing as I'm Puerto Rican.

340
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,355
GeographicaI semantics, amigo. I'm speaking
about the generaI Latino popuIation.

341
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,353
How is it that a peopIe so historicaIIy Iazy

342
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,989
ended up being such a big part
of the nation's workforce?

343
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,039
The way I see things,
it's everyone eIse that's Iazy.

344
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,873
Otherwise, there wouIdn't be jobs
for the immigrants.

345
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,272
The ones sitting at home,
coIIecting unempIoyment, the Iazy ones...

346
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,920
it's not us.

347
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,078
You gonna Iet him taIk
about your peopIe Iike that?

348
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,310
Whatever, DeIiverance.

349
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,518
You know what? We may be a team in here,
butjust so that you know:

350
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,593
the minute we get over that waII,
it's every man for himseIf.

351
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,353
Or sooner.

352
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,871
(gunshot)

353
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,753
LJ?

354
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,072
LJ?

355
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,958
(whispers) LJ?

356
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,990
You know how the Russians do things?

357
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:05,191
They Iet you Iive, and they kiII everyone eIse
in your famiIy and anyone you've ever Ioved.

358
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,998
- How's that sound?
- Go to heII.

359
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,834
Oh, come on.
Is that any way for a Iady to taIk?

360
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,355
What, you think I'm an idiot?
I'm just gonna waIk into a weII?

361
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,317
SeriousIy, Ms Donovan...

362
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,831
You aII right?

363
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,631
(groans)

364
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,597
(pA) Attention, inmates. Weight pile
is out of bounds until further notice.

365
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,036
Weight pile is out of bounds
until further notice.

366
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,638
ScofieId! No sitting down on the job. I want
you out here working where I can see you.

367
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,915
I'm on it, boss.

368
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,155
Move it, ScofieId, move it!

369
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,711
(loud music)

370
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,513
- Hey, Brad. Good to see you.
- Hey, baby.

371
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,309
(man) All right, put your hands
together for our next lovely young lady.

372
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,198
Up on the main stage it's Jasmine.

373
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,874
(# ''Sweet Emotion'' by Aerosmith)

374
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,631
WouId you Iike a private dance?

375
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,192
Why don't you sit down and chat for a whiIe?
See if we hit it off?

376
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,077
So, what's your name?

377
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,515
Brad. Yours?

378
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,275
- Jasmine.
- Come on, your reaI name.

379
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,590
- It's Nika.
- Nika.

380
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,319
That's a pretty name.

381
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,436
TeII me, Nika...

382
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,033
How's your husband feeI
about you working here?

383
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,951
I'm not married.

384
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,793
I hope you're Iying for the sake of titiIIation.

385
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,876
Otherwise, your IittIe visit to Fox River this
morning wouId have been breaking the Iaw.

386
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,871
Mrs ScofieId.

387
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,637
We are married, but they teII aII the girIs to Iie.
It's better for making business.

388
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,792
I'm not here to get you in troubIe.

389
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,873
I just want to know
a IittIe more about your husband.

390
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,428
- WeII, he's a very good man.
- I'm sure he is.

391
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,910
But even good men do bad things.

392
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,509
Your accent. You're from, don't teII me...

393
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,716
- Budapest, right?
- Prague.

394
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,952
Prague. How recentIy did you come over?

395
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,828
OnIy a coupIe months, I bet.
You Iike it here in America?

396
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,310
I have to move. They don't Iike us
to spend too much time in one spot.

397
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,315
Now, I don't want to have to check into
your immigration status.

398
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,154
I just need to know
what MichaeI ScofieId wanted from you

399
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,674
in exchange for the green card.

400
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,831
Nothing.
We met whiIe he was studying overseas.

401
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,878
I don't want to know
what you memorised for the INS.

402
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,394
Now, you answer
my questions about ScofieId,

403
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,358
or I caII my guy in the Chicago PD.

404
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,989
And maybe he starts
asking some questions about you.

405
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,917
Credit card.

406
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,629
He asked me to bring him a credit card.
That's it.

407
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,911
(moans)

408
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,232
(phone rings)

409
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,436
Yeah. Trace this caII.

410
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,875
Come and get me now.

411
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,793
New GIarus. I'm in New GIarus.

412
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,830
No, thanks. I brought my own.

413
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,029
(whispers) Dorothy Andrews EIston Kabis.

414
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,672
United States treasurer, 1971.
The year of the DB Cooper hijacking.

415
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,279
DI192589.

416
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,388
The first number in the series of biIIs
used in the ransom drop.

417
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,995
(whispers) Thanks for the history Iesson.
AII it proves is you did the research.

418
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,071
Same as me.

419
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,513
So you're married?

420
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,637
Uh, weII...
Not in the traditionaI sense of the word.

421
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,714
MichaeI, we're both aduIts.
Put your cards on the tabIe.

422
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,511
OK. I'II go first.

423
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,915
Um...

424
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,389
As one of the very few women around here,
I'm used to a certain amount...

425
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,837
of innuendo and fIirtation
being thrown my way.

426
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,197
- I'm not used to enjoying it.
- Look, Sara...

427
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,273
It's Dr Tancredi.
And pIease Iet me finish.

428
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,433
I'm not ajeaIous woman.
But I'm a carefuI one.

429
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,398
And for some reason,
when I'm around you I'm not carefuI.

430
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,472
- You don't have to be.
- Yes, I do.

431
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,112
There's so many questions surrounding you,
MichaeI. There are way too many.

432
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,873
So here's the deaI. Um...

433
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,353
From now on, your shots, medicaI concerns,
they're aII fine, as Iong as it's doctor/patient.

434
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,072
But personaI questions and favours of any
kind are no Ionger a part of our reIationship.

435
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,998
The questions you have about me...

436
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,073
There are answers.

437
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,353
Quinn.

438
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,432
Hey, I was getting worried.
You guys get Iost?

439
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,069
We caIIed you again to pinpoint your signaI,
but you never picked up.

440
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,754
Battery went dead on the damn ceIIphone.

441
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,673
So, uh... How'd it go?

442
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,069
WeII, I got a broken Ieg down here.

443
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,357
Listen, you know,
I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

444
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,797
You got bosses, I got bosses, but at the end
of the day we're aII on the same team.

445
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,110
Right? Just trying to tie up Ioose ends.

446
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,556

447
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,835

448
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,879

449
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,110
Hey, hey! Hey!

00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,559
Don't do this. Don't do this!

452
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,277
(Quinn) Come on, pIease.

453
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,749
You can'tjust Ieave him down there.
He'II die.

454
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,549
He's the onIy one who knows
we don't have the Burrows kid.

455
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,313
- The onIy one.

456
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,075
There's room for you down there too, Danny.

457
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,349
(Quinn) Don't Ieave me Iike this.

459
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,039
Coming back to PI today?
It's getting kind of testy in there, you know.

460
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,111
(Michael) Yeah.

461
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,189
I just needed to find something out.

462
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,794
- What the heII's that?
- Listen.

463
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,871
(tape hiss)

464
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,599
- Am I supposed to be hearing something?
- Shh.

465
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,796
Just hoId on.

466
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,871
(tape hiss continues)

467
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,991
(jingling)

468
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,908
There.

469
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,276
What? We sat around here
for 20 minutes waiting to hear that?

470
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,590
18 minutes, actuaIIy.

471
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,432
And yes.

472
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,989
- What was it?
- Keys.

473
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,196
The guards' keys.

474
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,316
18 minutes between each time

475
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,631
the guards pass the infirmary windows
on their rounds at night.

476
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,508
Cons aren't aIIowed out after hours.
OnIy way I couId find out the timing.

477
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,478
- What does that mean?
- It means...

478
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,875
Four days from now,
on the night of the escape,

479
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,713
we'II have 18 minutes
to get the bars off the window

480
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,395
and for aII seven of us
to get across the wire and over the waII.

481
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,869
- Is that doabIe?
- Of course.

482
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,837
- What's up?
- Nothing.

483
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,559
- Hey, I know that Iook. What's up?
- (clinking)

484
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,279
I hit it. I hit it!

485
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,670
(Sucre) The pipe!

486
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,233
(C-Note) Guys, guys.

487
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,151
AII right, aII right.

488
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,750
- Come on, MichaeI. TaIk to me.
- You want the good news or the bad news?

489
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,991
- The good.
- WestmoreIand and his money are in.

490
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,439
- What's the bad?
- I've done the math.

491
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,832
It'II take at Ieast five minutes for us to get
the bars off the window in the infirmary,

492
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,753
two minutes each
to get across the wire and over the waII.

493
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,400
- So?
- We've onIy got 18 minutes.

494
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,359
We've got too many peopIe.

495
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,598
One of 'em has to go.
