1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,593
previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,037
(Michael) Think of this pIace Iike a map of the
US. Our ceII over there, that's New York City.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,395
The infirmary, our exit, that's CaIifornia.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,994
The pipes beneath us that connect the two...

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,957
- Route 66.
- Our ticket out of here.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,909
Route 66 runs beneath that buiIding. It's the
onIy buiIding sitting on top of those tunneIs.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,391
AII we gotta do is get in there,
on PI, and dig ourseIves an onramp.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,631
- Which one?
- Right there.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,518
This goes down four feet.
Connects to the main Iine beIow.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,798
AII we've gotta do is widen it and
we've got ourseIves an onramp to Route 66.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,519
I'm gonna find out, you know,
what it is you're doing up there.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,831
You toId me that
you had been up in the crawIspace for PI,

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,708
and PI was never assigned to go there.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,917
We got you a IittIe get weII gift.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,639
What's your name?

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,793
There was an expIosion.
Gas Iine. Everyone inside was kiIIed.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,952
- These peopIe won't stop untiI we're dead.
- We can't hide forever.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,190
(Vp) How about that kid?
The one kiIIed his parents?

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,555
(Kellerman) Oh, they got him. He's in custody.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,756
I know what you Iook Iike, you son of a bitch.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,829
PhiIIy FaIzone.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,311
Word is someone knows where Fibonacci is
and you're not doing anything about it.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,151
(Cherry) HeIp me.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,750
PIease.

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,431
(T-Bag clears throat)

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,430
You'II have to forgive my boy.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,718
He has the propensity to be a bit gregarious
when he shouIdn't be.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,837
Fraternising in the prison shower. Come on.

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,434
Maybe you oughta cut the kid a break.

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,557
You wouIdn't be meddIing in my affairs,
now, wouId you?

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,870
You can't be that stupid.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,919
Not whiIe I'm so fuIIy invested in your affairs.

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,111
What's between you and him
is between you and him.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,835
That's what I thought you said.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,395
You've gotta heIp me.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,679
- (Lincoln) You gotta heIp me.
- This is a matter for the poIice.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,548
This is my son we're taIking about.
He's missing. Do something!

38
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,996
You have got to understand,
I am the warden of a prison.

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,038
When it comes to the Iaw,
there is nothing I can do.

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,272
Whatever happens is out of my jurisdiction
untiI it comes through those gates.

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,397
- Itjust did. Let me out.
- What?

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,995
Let me find him. I know how he thinks.
I know where he'd run.

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,359
I'd have thought by now you'd understand
your position as a death row inmate.

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,715
There is no way I can honour that request.

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,238
That ain't true. In case of a famiIy emergency,
you can grant an inmate supervised Ieave.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,313
Your son is a prime suspect
in a doubIe homicide.

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,993
Hey.

48
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,512
What do you think this is, a siesta?

49
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,310
You see that? You see my face up there?
Any idea how it got there?

50
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,594
Work ethic. Those two words
mean anything in your country?

51
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,390
You're on PI, so quit sIow-waIking me.
I'm not gonna warn you again.

52
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,755
What are you Iooking at?

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,472
The buIIs find this stuff,
they'II know we're digging.

54
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,678
That's why we gotta get rid of it.
One piece at a time.

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,914
(pA) Attention in the yard.
All prisoners remain 40ft away from gate A.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,434
New prisoners arriving in fve minutes.

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,469
l repeat, attention in the yard.
All prisoners remain 40ft away from gate A.

58
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,358
New prisoners arriving in fve minutes.

59
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,509
Attention in the yard. All prisoners maintain
a 40ft perimeter around gate A.

60
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,670
Freshmen.

61
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,790
Best put on ourjaiI face, BG.

62
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,555
These crabs see you puckering,
they bitchify you in a heartbeat.

63
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,631
(satisfed grunt)

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,037
- I gotta find something eIse to caII you now.
- Why's that?

65
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,240
Cos you ain't a fish no more.
You ain't the newest con in the tank.

66
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,110
(Michael) I couId've done something.

67
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,952
(Lincoln) No.

68
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,591
T-Bag had his hooks in that kid.
There was nothing you couId have done.

69
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,117
I couId've toId the Pope.
He couId've transferred the kid to ADSEG.

70
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,033
Go easy, MichaeI. You didn't even know him.

71
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,309
And that makes it OK? I turned my back
on him because I didn't wanna make waves.

72
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,710
It was just... easier

73
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,268
to Iook the other way,

74
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,237
keep the pIan safe.

75
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,470
And you did.

76
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,471
But at what price?

77
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,393
That's not how she raised us.

78
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,358
A man's down, you give him your hand.

79
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,279
She'd roII over in her grave if she knew.

80
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,592
She wouIdn't.
You've given me your hand, MichaeI.

81
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,037
My son's out there
with a buII's eye on his back.

82
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,591
Do whatever you gotta do
to get us out of here. PIease.

83
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,831
(police siren)

84
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,078
(Nick) What are you doing?

85
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,232
I was just Iooking for some coffee.

86
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,276
There isn't any.

87
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,353
They beIonged to my father,
if you were wondering.

88
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,309
- How Iong have they been in there?
- I don't know. Five years?

89
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,592
You know, Veronica, we've been through a Iot
and I'm freaking out here as much as you are,

90
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,753
but you get this Iook in your eye sometimes
Iike... Iike I'm the bad guy.

91
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,994
I don't know who you are. You just magicaIIy
show up Iike some knight in shining armour.

92
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,470
You know, I think
you seem to be forgetting something here.

93
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,509
I'm in the cross hairs the same way you are,
aII for your ex, who is a scumbag criminaI

94
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,195
who just happens to be in prison
for the one crime he didn't commit.

95
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,276
You know something? I got enough of my
own crap to deaI with. You wanna go, you go.

96
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,918
- Mind if I Iamp with you, cuzzo?
- RoII, snowfIake.

97
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,358
Hey, man, I'm just... I'm just new, you know?
I'm Iooking for some homies.

98
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,353
- I said roII.
- Brother, I'm just Iaunching.

99
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,319
Yeah? WeII, Iaunch somewhere eIse,
white boy.

100
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,598
AII right, y'aII.

101
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,875
I'm fitting to bounce.

102
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,354
Peace.

103
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,314
Boy's a bit confused about his pigmentation,

104
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,551
but he sure does have spunk, doesn't he?

105
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,358
- Abruzzi!
- Yeah?

106
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,079
What are you doing?

107
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,074
What do you mean, what am I doing?

108
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,392
- First of the month's coming up, John.
- Yeah? So?

109
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,119
I haven't got my monthIy.

110
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,469
- What?
- I checked my baIance. It's Iooking deficient.

111
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,070
Uh...

112
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,392
It's gotta be some kind of a mistake,
Iike an accounting error.

113
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,234
Yeah. TeII FaIzone
I don't stand for accounting errors.

114
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,791
I'm going back into my office at the end of
the day. Gonna check my baIance again.

115
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,112
If it's not up to where it's supposed to be,
aII these priviIeges you got,

116
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,555
Iike running PI,

117
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,676
they're gone.

118
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,792
Get it done, John.

119
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,075
- (woman) Falzone Enterprises.
- Get PhiIIy.

120
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,278
- Mr Falzone's not available.
- You teII him it's John Abruzzi caIIing.

121
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,319
- l'm sorry. l didn't realise.
- WeII, now you do.

122
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,391
Um...

123
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,910
- l'm sorry. He's gonna have to call you back.
- What? Hey...

124
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,389
(line goes dead)

125
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,232
I'm sorry. About before.

126
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,950
Pressure's getting to us, that's aII.

127
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,635
Good news is nobody can reach us out here.
My oId man made sure of that.

128
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,793
Never even hooked up the teIephone.
Same with the weII and the generator.

129
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,236
I used to think he was
some kind of conspiracy theory wacko.

130
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,596
- Turns out maybe he was right.
- I can't stay, Nick.

131
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,355
I gotta get back. He's got Iess than two weeks.

132
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,235
The oId man caIIed this his serious tie.

133
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,279
He onIy wore it
when he reaIIy, reaIIy meant business.

134
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,709
Be dangerous showing our faces again.

135
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,758
Not if they're not Iooking for us.
They think we're dead.

136
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,400
Yeah, but how Iong is that gonna Iast?

137
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,439
Gotta be quick, be smart about it.
We're just gonna be running in circIes

138
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,718
if we think we can find excuIpatory evidence
before the execution.

139
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,792
I've gone up against every prosecutor
in Cook County.

140
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,876
Man gets murdered, the first person they
taIk to to see who his enemies were, the wife.

141
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,509
- You wanna go after the queen bee herseIf?
- LesIie Steadman.

142
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,515
Everyone in town knows the oId bird
Iunches at the Lexington every day

143
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,909
with the society set.

144
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,871
Hey, hey. Hey, hey!

145
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,235
SIow down. SIow down!

146
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,949
Man, your brother's gonna give us away.

147
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,473
- BuII's coming.
- (Abruzzi) Let's move.

148
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,831
Hurry up, guys. Move it.

149
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,395
- AII right.
- Everybody out.

150
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,153
- What?
- I said everybody out.

151
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,629
Now.

152
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,871
Move it!

153
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,195
- Where are we going?
- Around the corner.

154
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,478
And don't move a damn muscIe
tiII I come get you. Go!

155
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,155
What the heII's going on?

156
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,431
- We're so bad, aren't we?
- You're damn skippy. Let's go.

157
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,312
- You gotta give us more of a warning.
- I'm sorry. He just showed up.

158
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,551
Mm. Mm. Mm.

159
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,029
Oh, we're gonna get caught
by the warden. Oh!

160
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,874
(guard) Baby, right now,
in this room, at this moment,

161
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,430
- I am the warden.
- Oh!

162
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,078
- (guard) Then say it.
- No.

163
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,435
- (guard) Come on, baby, say it.
- Oh!

164
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,034
- (guard) Say it.
- You're the warden, Louis!

165
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,111
(guard) Yes, yes.

166
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,759
The sneaky son of a bitch.

167
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,120
You think he found the hoIe?

168
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,915
Another inch and he'd have found it. We need
to find something to cover this hoIe ASAP.

169
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,434
(Abruzzi) Broke. What do you mean, broke?

170
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,432
The C-Corp, the investment accounts,

171
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,913
even the offshore stuff, Caymans, Bermuda...
PhiIIy FaIzone Iiquidated everything.

172
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,437
Hey, I toId you from the beginning
what wouId happen if you screwed me.

173
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,640
I heeded it. That's why I warned you from the
get-go not to give PhiIIy power of attorney.

174
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,439
We had that conversation, remember?

175
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,719
Look, the onIy reaI funds you have Ieft
are the 30,000 in your wife's pocket account.

176
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,951
- Now, I can...
- Don't. Don't touch that.

177
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,554
Nobody touches that but her.

178
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,200
What do I teII her? You know, about aII this?

179
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,272
Don't teII her anything, OK?

180
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,238
The statements are going to come.
She's going to know.

181
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,515
Hey, I toId you.

182
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,075
Don't teII her.

183
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,116
AII right?

184
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,475
You got a probIem with that?

185
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,070
OK, John. You know where to contact me
if you need anything eIse.

186
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,197
The same goes for you.

187
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,151
Hey.

188
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,231
Hey!

189
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,071
- PhiIIy.
- You.

190
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,473
So good to see you.
For you, the answer's aIways yes, PhiIIy.

191
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,755
Sit down.

192
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,038
- Sit down.
- (guard) Come on, John.

193
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,917
There's no record
of a Fox River medicaI practice

194
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,878
on our Iist of participating HMOs or PPOs.

195
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,875
That's because we're a state penitentiary,
and we're in kind of a unique situation here.

196
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,033
Mr ScofieId's insurance poIicy
from his previous empIoyer hasn't Iapsed.

197
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,352
The state's demanding that you pay
for his treatment and not the taxpayers.

198
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,433
OK. Well, it says here
he already met his deductible.

199
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,351
OK.

200
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,910
Oh, no, wait. That's his psych deductibIe,
not his medicaI.

201
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,673
Sorry. Psych as in psychiatric?

202
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,911
Did I give you permission to caII PhiIIy?
Hey, I asked you a question, man.

203
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,709
Listen. There, uh...
there's been a restructuring.

204
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,473
This comes from PhiIIy himseIf.

205
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,558
You couIdn't deIiver Fibonacci,
so I'm the man in here now.

206
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,509
Run to the commissary and get me a packet
of chips. We'II pretend this never happened.

207
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,470
No, I'm teIIing you, John. The sooner you face
these facts, the better off we wiII aII be.

208
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,233
I can kiII you in a heartbeat.

209
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,510
Somehow, I doubt that.

210
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,720
The sooner you face facts,
the better off we wiII aII be.

211
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,593
You're yesterday's news, John.

212
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,952
- What's the word? Y'aII cooking brownies?
- Act your race, miIk chicken.

213
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,316
What's the deaI, yo?
You got tough buckets or something?

214
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,870
You're a disgrace to your skin,
you know that?

215
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,114
The boy just sIipped.

216
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,316
The boy just sIipped.

217
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,868
Ain't that right?

218
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,710
- Come on. Stand up.
- (guard) Cons, Iet's get back to your ceIIs.

219
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,995
What's your name, boy?

220
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,835
- Who's that?
- StoIte.

221
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,480
StoIte. You've heard about my kid, right?

222
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,233
- Take the tray, Linc.
- I, uh....

223
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,719
I just need to caII him.

224
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,830
Just take the tray, or I'm gonna shove it
in there and you can eat it off the ground.

225
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,873
You have a son. Josh.

226
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,189
Don't do anything stupid, Linc.

227
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,391
I'm not. I just wanna ask you a question,
then I'm gonna Iet go.

228
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,076
What if it were Josh?

229
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,355
What if it were your son?

230
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,477
PIease.

231
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,271
(phone rings)

232
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,318
- Dad?
- LJ. Thank God. Are you aII right?

233
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,589
No. Nowhere near it.

234
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,470
- What do you mean? Where are you?
- What they're saying about me, it's not true.

235
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,597
- I know it's not true.
- They killed her. They killed her.

236
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,478
Right in front of me.
Right in front of my eyes.

237
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,994
- You gotta...
- Why are they doing this?

238
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,913
You gotta step up. You gotta be the man now.

239
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,309
- You understand me, LJ?
- Yeah.

240
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,076
- OK. I want you to caII Veronica.
- Her number is disconnected. I aIready tried.

241
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,550
Nick Savrinn. You caII Nick Savrinn.
Works for Project Justice.

242
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,279
You caII him once we're done. You got it?

243
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,238
Nick Savrinn. OK.

244
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,596
- OK, I'II caII. I'II caII.
- AII right, man.

245
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,759
Hang in there, man. lt's gonna be all right.

246
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,717
Hey...

247
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,712
- They're here.
- Who's here?

248
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,711
LJ?

249
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,153
LJ!

250
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,709
(phone vibrates)

251
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,038
(cocks gun)

252
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,674
You hear that?

253
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,714
Did you hear it?

254
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,995
You know what that means?

255
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,118
Why don't you ask your mom what it means?

256
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,991
Oh, I'm sorry. You might have troubIe getting
an answer out of her right about now, huh?

257
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,511
LJ?

258
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,349
(car horn)

259
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,516
- I saw that.
- Just getting connected, that's aII.

260
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,151
There she is.

261
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,112
Mrs Steadman? I'm Dick SisIer.

262
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,113
This is Francette KeIIy
of the NationaI Victims' Rights Association.

263
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,990
We assist victims of vioIent crimes, gather
support for tough-on-crime poIiticians.

264
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,154
If your organisation's Iooking for a hand-out,
you can go through my business manager.

265
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,119
Ma'am, that is not why we're here, actuaIIy.
May we sit down?

266
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,035
We hoped you couId heIp us with one of our
more pubIic cases. The LincoIn Burrows case.

267
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,875
He's making cIaims that he's innocent, that
others had motive to murder your husband.

268
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,999
- I don't have time for a Iong conversation.
- It doesn't have to be Iong.

269
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,959
If we taIked about who had motive
to kiII Terrence, we'd be here aII day.

270
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,632
- I'm sorry?
- Look around.

271
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,996
HaIf the peopIe here
were sharehoIders in his company.

272
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,594
Every one of them
sat at my husband's memoriaI

273
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,673
and every one of them was thinking
the same thing: ''Thank God he's gone.''

274
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,558
- Why wouId they think that?
- Money.

275
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,633
As soon as rumours of the indictment started,
they ran for the exits.

276
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,508
- I wasn't aware of any indictment.
- It never came down. He died first.

277
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,559
- Anything to do with EcofieId?
- Do the math. CEO gets indicted for fraud.

278
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,475
Investors start Iosing money. Lots of money.
If I didn't know Burrows puIIed that trigger,

279
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,998
I'd say it was any one of these peopIe in the
restaurant. We're taIking haIf a biIIion doIIars.

280
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,514
PeopIe have kiIIed for a Iot Iess.

281
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,195
Hey, what's up? 'Sup?

282
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,430
(T-Bag) Not a good position
you find yourseIf in, is it?

283
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,797
Whites don't want you. BIacks don't want you.

284
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,111
You're just caught in the middIe, aren't you?

285
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,191
A reguIar 'tweener.

286
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,836
We're different, you and me, Iot of ways.

287
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,516
But, you know,
the funny thing is we're aIso a Iot aIike.

288
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,072
CoupIe of dogs with runny noses
that nobody Ioves.

289
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,555
How's that knee, by the way?

290
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,315
- What the heII are you doing?
- Don't get me wrong. I'm just a friend.

291
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,073
- A fruity friend. I don't need none of that.
- Easy.

292
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:47,793
No. No. You think you're getting up in this,
you got another thing coming, you homo.

293
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,070
- You got a fouI mouth, you know that?
- Yeah. I do.

294
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,073
And you come near me again,
I'm gonna kiII you.

295
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,153
WeII, then,
you're just gonna have to, IittIe man.

296
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,158
- (T-Bag) You sIeep with one eye open.
- Bring it on.

297
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,597
- Oh, I'm gonna bring it on in spades.
- (Michael) You oughta Ieave that kid aIone.

298
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,549
Maybe you are in no position
to be teIIing me my business. Hm?

299
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,473
That's what I thought.

300
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,554
I'm sure you can understand
my reIuctance to discuss past patients.

301
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,838
My understanding is that under HIPAA
we're aIIowed to share information

302
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,595
as Iong as it furthers the care of the patient.

303
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,515
I'm not accustomed to making
enquiries Iike this, but I...

304
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,273
I feeI Iike I can get through to him.

305
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,715
I can heIp him.

306
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,032
- I imagine he needs it in there.
- What did you treat him for?

307
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,994
MichaeI suffered from a coupIe of things.

308
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,958
One was a condition
caIIed Iow Iatent inhibition.

309
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,032
Sorry. I'm not famiIiar with the term.

310
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,759
PeopIe who suffer from Iow Iatent inhibition

311
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,638
see everyday things Iike you or I do,
Iike this Iamp.

312
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,071
But where we just process the image
of a Iamp, they process everything.

313
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,950
The stem, the buIb, the boIts,
even the washers inside.

314
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,512
Their brains are more open to incoming
stimuli in the surrounding environment.

315
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,390
Other peopIe's brains - yours and mine -
shut out the same information.

316
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,552
We have to do it in order to keep our sanity.

317
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,996
If someone with a Iow IQ
has Iow Iatent inhibition,

318
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,595
it aImost aIways resuIts in mentaI iIIness.

319
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,118
But if someone has a high IQ,
it aImost aIways resuIts in creative genius.

320
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,237
Do you think MichaeI's a genius?

321
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,313
WeII, I think that word's been derogated
in the media these days.

322
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,836
But in the cIassic sense of the word, yes, I do.

323
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,028
You... you said there was something eIse
you treated him for?

324
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,396
He came to me
with absoIuteIy no sense of seIf-worth.

325
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,631
The Ioss of both parents
very often does that to a chiId.

326
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,919
But with the Iow Iatent inhibition,
something interesting happened to MichaeI.

327
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,879
He became very attuned
to aII the suffering around him.

328
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,190
He couIdn't shut it out.

329
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,350
He became a rescuer,

330
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,753
one of those peopIe who are more concerned
with other peopIe's weIfare than their own.

331
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,308
I didn't know aII this about him.

332
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,075
Then maybe you don't know MichaeI ScofieId.

333
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,711
Yeah.

334
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,758
(T-Bag) # Oh, Tweener

335
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,879
# I'm coming

336
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,794
# Oh, Tweener

337
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,275
# Oh, Tweener

338
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,069
# I'm a-coming for you

339
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,196
# I'm coming

340
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,271
# Coming

341
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,593
# Is you ready? Are you ready?

342
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,671
# However you are, see, I'm here

343
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,955
# I'm coming for you

344
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,393
# Are you ready? Are you ready?

345
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,233
# I'm coming, I'm coming

346
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,153
# I'm a-coming, I'm a-coming, I'm coming

347
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,435
# I am coming

348
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,274
I checked my voicemaiI at work.

349
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,916
LincoIn's son LJ just Ieft me a message.
He's in troubIe.

350
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,469
(phone vibrates)

351
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,711
- HeIIo?
- LJ, it's Veronica. Where are you?

352
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,872
Oh, Veronica, I don't know.
You gotta come get me.

353
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,077
We can't, OK? We're not in Chicago.
You have to come to us.

354
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,357
Oh. AII right. Where's that?

355
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,878
Oh.

356
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,758
Oh. How the heII do they know where I am?

357
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,991
- (Veronica) What's going on?
- (LJ) How do they know where l am?

358
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,437
- LJ, LJ, I want you to Iisten to me.
- Everywhere I go, they're there.

359
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,752
I want you to Iisten to me, OK? I need you
to come to us. We're in Lake Mercer.

360
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,956
- Where's that?
- On the Iowa border.

361
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,713
There's a bus station. We'II meet you there.

362
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,157
- They're stiII aIive.
- The bird in the hand just became three.

363
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,198
- (Veronica) Keep your cellphone open.
- (Kellerman) Let's go.

364
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,157
- But the kid's right...
- Let's go.

365
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,117
- (LJ) OK.
- (Veronica) OK, what?

366
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,352
OK, I'II keep it open.
They're Ieaving. They're Ieaving.

367
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,989
LJ, I need to know that you hear me, OK?
Lake Mercer.

368
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,389
Lake Mercer. OK.

369
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,471
AII right, bye.

370
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,471
(glass smashes)

371
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,873
What the heII are you doing?

372
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,352
DeIivering yesterday's news.

373
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,271
(Gus screams)

374
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,116
Your bus Ieaves from depot six
in just a few minutes.

375
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,191
Thanks.

376
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,028
- Yo, man, get off me, bitch.
- Let's pants him.

377
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,230
I... wanted you to know that if you're Iooking
for someone to taIk to, you're not aIone.

378
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,472
It's part of my job to counseI inmates
and heIp them with their probIems.

379
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,074
I got things pretty weII figured out.

380
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,758
I sort of backed into
some information about you.

381
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,356
I hope you don't mind,
but there's a reason I became a doctor.

382
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,113
It's in my nature to want to heIp.

383
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,909
From what I understand,
it's in your nature too.

384
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,189
You did a Iot of good things before you were
in here. Community work, charity work.

385
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,350
What happened?

386
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,717
The man you're taIking about died
the moment I stepped inside these waIIs.

387
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,791
AII right.

388
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,311
(pA) Shuttle now arriving on platform one.

389
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,073
Shuttle departs in ten minutes.

390
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,069
Ladies and gentIemen,
United States Secret Service.

391
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,630
PIease remain caIm. Remain where you are.

392
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,434
(man) Watch your step, son.

393
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,032
Hey.

394
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,111
Come here.

395
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,471
It's OK.

396
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,597
They're Ieaving.

397
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,750
(phone beeps)

398
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,831
You're safe now, aII right?

399
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,110
You received communication
from your attorney.

400
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,159
PIease sign this document
certifying that I inspected it for contraband

401
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,755
without at any time
breaching attorney-cIient priviIege

402
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,196
by reading the materiaIs encIosed herein.

403
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,029
- What are you grinning about?
- I'm gonna be out in the reaI worId in a bit.

404
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,513
The fact that I'm gonna get me one fine piece
of taiI certainIy don't hurt either.

405
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,751
Nothing Iike taiI, eh, ScofieId?

406
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,558
(laughs)

407
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,193
- (screams) Son of a bitch!
- This ends right now.

408
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,875
Oh, you just screwed
some major Ieague pooch, pretty.

409
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,997
I'm gonna sing Iike a whoIe tree
fuII of birds now. Badge!

410
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,152
You wanna sing, then sing.

411
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,629
But you know what I think?

412
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,439
You don't have the guts.

413
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,877
You want out of here
just as much as the rest of us.

414
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,474
We got a probIem here?

415
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,512
No.

416
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,397
I, uh...

417
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,315
I thought we was missing some tooIs here.

418
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,039
My bad.

419
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,475
Get back to work.

420
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,871
Now.

421
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,548
You and I may be stuck together
in this IittIe dance, but I caII the shots.

422
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,995
First shot, that kid out there,

423
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,594
you don't touch him ever.

424
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,993
Do we understand each other?

425
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,272
We do.

426
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,715
(Bellick) Out of the way, JuIio.

427
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,597
Abruzzi.

428
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,839
You and me,
we're gonna have a conversation.

429
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,074
(Lincoln) How come he didn't faII through?

430
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,073
- What?
- I warned you.

431
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,309
I'II get it together.
You gotta give me more time.

432
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,789
You've had your time, John.

433
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,757
You tripping on something, AIice?

434
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,235
Yeah. That's what I thought.

435
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,719
Lamp it up in here again,
I'II be fixing to break some shop.

436
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,549
Uh-oh. We got a probIem.

437
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,071
BeIIick.

438
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,316
Boss. Boss. What's happening?
What are they doing?

439
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,951
- Fixing the break room.
- What are you taIking about? That's PI.

440
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,031
I run it.

441
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,835
Not any more, you don't.
