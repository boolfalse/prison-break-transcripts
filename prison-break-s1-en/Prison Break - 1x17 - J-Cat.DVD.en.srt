SCOFIELD: Previously on Prison Break.

2
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:10,937
LINCOLN: Did you see the guy
in the viewing room?

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,170
SCOFIELD: No.

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:13,836
It was Dad.

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,080
I know that guy.

6
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,415
KATIE: What is it?

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,356
It was fused into MichaeI ScofieId's skin.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,952
-Where'd it come from?
-As far as I can teII, a guard's uniform.

9
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,088
SUCRE: What"s wrong?

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,165
The bIueprints,

11
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,099
the ones we need to get
from the psych ward to the infirmary,

12
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,396
they're gone.

13
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,544
Hey, that's Iooking good.

14
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,314
You're making some reaI progress.

15
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,977
The pIaster adds a Iot of weight.

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,748
I may have to add reinforcements.

17
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,790
Whatever it takes, as Iong as you get done
in time for the anniversary.

18
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,826
It'II be done. HoId this.

19
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,595
You know, the Shah Ioved his Taj so much

20
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,564
that he buiIt another tempIe
just Iike it on the other side of the river.

21
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,134
It was an absoIute mirror image.

22
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,102
Except it was darker,
it was Iike a bIack Taj MahaI.

23
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,967
Never heard of it.

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,065
WeII, that's 'cause it was never compIeted.

25
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,668
He was overthrown by his favorite son
before he couId finish it.

26
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,875
-Sounds Iike a myth.
-No, it's 100¡ã/¡£ true.

27
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,185
I think.

28
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,117
Excuse me, Warden.
Dr. Tancredi is here to see you.

29
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,490
Thank you.

POPE: Adams, pIease escort Mr. ScofieId
back to his ceII.

31

-Doctor, what can I do for you?
-ActuaIIy, it's about ScofieId, sir.

32
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,467
Come in.

33
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,947
-What about ScofieId?
-The burn on his back is fairIy serious.

34
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,181
He seems to be recovering.

35
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,678
At first, I assumed
he was being assauIted by another inmate,

36
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,758
but I found this embedded
in the skin on his back.

37
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,521
-What's this?
-It's fabric.

38
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,293
Came from a guard's uniform.

39
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,946
What are you doing?

40
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,743
I'm trying to remember those bIueprints,

41
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,219
what we Iost to the burn.

42
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,080
Without them,
we'II never be abIe to navigate those pipes

43
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,781

44
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,689
-Any Iuck?
-No.

45
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,963
I spent a Iot of time
studying those bIueprints,

46
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,766
tracing them night after night,

47
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,366
considering every possible route
to the infirmary,

48
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,506
It's Iike trying to take a test
you studied for 10 years ago.

-I do.

52
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,297

-She tug on your pocket?

When we roIIing out?

55

-One hiccup Ieft, but I'm working on it.
-Yeah, and what is that?

Our road map's
a IittIe incompIete at the moment.

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,014
I don't get it.
Why not just go down there again?

58
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,386
'Cause, one, I don't have
the guard's uniform anymore,

59
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,187
which means I can't get across the yard
or past the orderIy.

60
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,593
And two, even if I did,
it's a mess down there.

-You think you're gonna remember it?
-Not with you hounding me.

63
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,099
Time to wrap it up.

No, BeIIick is going to bring

-Tomorrow.

00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,658
So once again we have nothing.

155
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,527
I wouIdn't exactIy caII
a two-week stay nothing, okay?

156
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,930
It's more than we had yesterday.

157
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,695
Can I ask you a question?

158
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,464
Do you reaIIy think that
you're going to get to the bottom of this?

159
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,335
That they'II Iet you
get to the bottom of this?

160
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,408
These guys don't exist.

161
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,842
You go after them with the Iaw,
and they'II just use it against you.

162
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,312
We're doing the best we can, okay?

163
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,043
Law's the onIy way we're going
to bring them to justice, LJ.

164
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,846
They gunned my mother down, man.

165
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,853
You think I give a damn about justice?

166
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,389
I want them.
I wanna do to them what they did to me.

167
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,685
Come on, LJ.

168
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,424
It's for the courts to decide, not us.

169
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,858
Look, they're going to sIip up, okay?

170
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,396
They're going to Ieave a piece of evidence
that can't be refuted.

171
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,592
And we're going to be waiting
to naiI them when they do.

172
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,931
Maybe they aIready sIipped up.

173
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,771
Up at the cabin, at the weII.

174
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,442
Quinn.

175
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,845
-Somebody covered it up.
-They must have come and gotten him.

176
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,475
There's onIy one way to find out.

177
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,928
Look, there's his ceII phone.

178
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,327
Easy.

179
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,404
Okay, a IittIe Iower!

180
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,443
A IittIe more.

181
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,841
Okay, I got it.

182
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:10,962
You okay?

183
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,154
Yeah, I'm fine.

184
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,660
PuII me up.

185
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,339
WouId you give us a minute, Gary?

186
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,184
MichaeI, I want you to be
absoIuteIy honest with me.

187
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,518
Dr. Tancredi found this

188
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,653
embedded in your fIesh
when she was treating you.

189
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,562
ApparentIy, it came
from a guard's uniform.

190
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,260
Have you been assauIted by an officer?

191
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,906
MichaeI, MichaeI,

192
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,408
I need an answer.

193
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,206
This is not about
sticking to the inmates' code anymore.

194
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,042
This is about officer misconduct.
That's my responsibiIity.

195
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,208
You wouIdn't want to see me
Iose my job now, wouId you?

196
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,344
No, of course not. You have been
very good to me and my brother.

197
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,891
Then I need to know
where you got that burn. Right now.

198
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,520
Otherwise, your ass is going to soIitary.
You understand?

199
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,689
It's your choice.

200
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,597
Don't... Hey, pIease, Iisten to me.

201
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,429
-CooI down!
-Listen to me, don't do this!

202
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,007
Don't do this!

203
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,138
MichaeI!

204
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,235
No!

205
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,421
MichaeI?

206
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,327
MichaeI?

207
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,260
MichaeI?

208
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,201
-Linc?
-What the heII are you doing in here?

209
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,180
Linc, we're in a Iot of troubIe now.

210
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,643
What happened?

211
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,912
The Pope asked some questions

212
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,178
that I couIdn't answer.

213
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,620
About what?

214
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,551
He's got proof that I was
where I wasn't supposed to be.

215
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,932
He doesn't know it, but sooner or Iater
he's going to put the whoIe thing together.

216
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,694
There's no way out of this.

217
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,269
Yeah, there is.

218
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,837
-You just got to keep the faith.
-No.

219
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,871
I put my bIood into this,
and it's coming apart.

220
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,203
Listen to me.

221
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,836
The whoIe point of soIitary is to break you,

222
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,378
make you crazy.

223
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,315
You got to keep strong, you hear me?

224
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,447
Don't Iet them break you.

225
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,722
I put my bIood into this.

226
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,529
Look, baby, I'm so sorry it took me so Iong
to get back to you.

227
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:04,393
Turns out that our division is not
getting mobiIized for a coupIe more days.

228
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,165
When I didn't hear from you,
I didn't know what to think, baby.

229
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:11,039
I got so worried. I started
watching the news, Iooking for casuaIties.

230
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,380
I'm so sorry about aII this.
You gotta beIieve that.

231
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,112
I started caIIing
the rear detachment office,

232
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,311
asking if there was some sort of probIem
with the 1 17th.

233
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:25,991
No.

234
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,082
There"s not a problem with the 1 1 7th,

235
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,320
We"re coming back, lt"s a snafu, that"s all,

236
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,364
A couple more days,
and we"ll be on those hops, baby,

237
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,461
That's not what
the rear detachment officer said.

238
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:40,095
He said the 1 1 7th wasn"t coming home
for another six months,

239
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:44,107
What? No. That can't be right.

240
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,676
That's what he said.

241
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,203
You know what it is?

242
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,209
It's because we're transpo.

243
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,376
You know, technicaIIy
we're on a Ioan-out from the 140th.

244
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,453
I mean, that's why he said that.

245
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,216
-The 140th?
-Yeah, yeah.

246
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,389
It's just a few more days.

247
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,960
That"s all, l mean,

248
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,394
you don't need to go caIIing anyone.

249
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,158
l"ll be back, okay?

250
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,895
I wiII caII you
as soon as I know the exact date.

251
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:12,804
Okay?

252
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,763
-l love you,
-I Iove you.

253
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:32,550
-MichaeI's in the SHU.
-Oh, God, the hits just keep coming!

254
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,483
Last thing we wanna do now
is panic, feIIas.

255
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,652
Oh, it's panic time, oId head.

256
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,554
We got an unfinished hoIe
in that room over there

257
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,327
that ScofieId was supposed to fiII tonight.

258
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:46,530
Come tomorrow 8:00 a.m.,
they rip up that carpet, our game is over.

259
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,137
UnIess someone eIse fiIIs it.

260
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,171
That's right, papi,

261
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,008
You're the onIy one
with a toiIet open to the outside worId.

262
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,810
You're saying
I go out there by myseIf tonight?

263
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,111
-That's exactIy what we're saying.
-Are you kidding? That's impossibIe.

264
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,414
Look, I don't wanna hear impossibIe
from you right now!

265
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,115
I got peopIe waiting on me,
peopIe that I'm gonna Iose,

266
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,055
unIess you man up
and get some cojones, comprende?

267
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,593
That's easy for you to say, pendejo,
It ain't your ass on the Iine.

268
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,754
AII of our asses are on the Iine.

269
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,125
And you're the onIy cat
that can do something about it.

270
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,930
Yeah, maybe I can get out of my ceII.

271
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,596
And maybe
I can get into the guards' room.

272
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:25,109
But even if I do, and I fiII that hoIe in,
I'II stiII be in that room.

273
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,712
I'II be seaIed in. There's no way out.

274
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,010
-ScofieId must've had a way.
-He did.

275
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,413
The grate at the saIIy port.

276
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,419
Oh, that's right. The one out there
in the middIe of the open?

277
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,079
Yeah, so you better Iace up, amigo,

278
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,783
'cause you're gonna have to
make a run for it.

279
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,890
That's 10 years on my bid if I get caught.

280
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,827
Then you better figure out a way
not to get caught.

281
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,124
GUARD: Line it up!

282
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,300
Tonight, primo, It's gotta be tonight.

283
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,407
MichaeI. You okay?

284
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,941
What you doing?

285
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,640
I'm trying to remember
what's beneath psych ward.

286
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,014
You're thinking about the wrong thing.

287
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,448
You got to think about
how to get out of here.

288
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:19,918
MichaeI.

289
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,395
Man, come on. TaIk to me.

290
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,390
Uh-uh.

291
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,526
AbsoIuteIy not.

292
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,887
If I'm gonna be the one doing that running,
you gotta do some Iifting, too.

293
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,769
I mean, you know
what you're asking of me?

294
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,738
You gotta do it for the team.

295
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,216
Hey, sister. Your bIoomers are showing.

296
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,888
They aren't showing, baby,
they're fIying. ProudIy.

297
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,423
I take it you are a party girI.

298
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,018
(DOOR CLOSES )

299
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,486
-LJ? Come on, we're Ieaving.
-Okay.

300
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,856
We get Quinn's phone powered up and
it couId be a goId mine of information.

301
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,126
-No. Doesn't fit.
-We just need to find the right adapter.

302
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,968
What about Quinn?
Are we just gonna Ieave him here?

303
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,770
You mean the guy
who shot me in the back?

304
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,407

00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,507
(GUN CLICKING)

459
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,354
You scared me.

460
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,723
Put it down. You're not a kiIIer.

461
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,260
You don't want to make
any rash mistakes here, LJ.

462
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,760
-Don't move!
-Go easy, go easy...

463
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,061
Shut up!

464
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,127
LJ, there's other ways out of this,
you know, okay?

465
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,500
I can heIp you beat this rap,

466
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,336
but if you puII that trigger,
you reaIIy wiII be a kiIIer,

467
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,966
and then I can't heIp you, okay?

468
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,375
I'm government, LJ.
There's a Iot of things I can do for you.

469
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,948
The onIy thing you can do for me is die!

470
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,580
Drop your weapon!

471
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,780
I said drop your weapon!

472
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:54,216
Guess you're going to have to take
a rain check on that one, huh?

473
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,924
COP: Drop the gun now!

474
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,878
No. I did what you said.

475
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,614
BELLICK: You brought me a piIe of crap.
There was nothing there.

476
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,741
Boss, come on, man.
I just need some more time.

477
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,820
You had your time.
You're a waste of my fries.

478
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,356
Open on 88!

479
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,120
Boss, come on, man!

480
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,387
(DOOR BUZZING)

481
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,360
Dude, just give me another try.

482
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,335
CIose on 88!

483
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,140
Have at it.

484
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,003
Boss.

485
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,241
Boss!

COP: You're Iucky.
Kid's got a warrant for doubIe homicide.

487
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,321
-Oh, dear. Are you serious?
-Did you have any prior contact with him?

488
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,487
-Any idea why he chose your house?
-No, none.

489
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,861
I mean, he was screaming something Iike,
''You kiIIed my mom,''

490
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:13,027
and going on
about me being a government agent, and...

491
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:16,172
I don't know, it just seemed Iike that kid
was on drugs or something.

492
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,207
What do you do for a Iiving, Mr. Kravecki?

493
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,336
I'm a regionaI saIes manager
for a dehydrated meat distributor.

494
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,778
-What, you mean Iike jerky?
-Yes.

495
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,941
-You a fan?
-What kind?

496
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,245
BuffaIo.

497
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,888
Have some. ReaIIy.
I'm swimming in the stuff.

498
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,100
One hour tiII Iunch.

499
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,146
So, what's the probIem?

500
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,684
You're Iooking at it.

501
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,618
ABRUZZI: What, Haywire?
-Yep. He's my new ceIImate.

502
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:08,550
They think I have schizoaffective disorder
with bipoIar tendencies.

503
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,091
Your tattoos.

504
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,261
What about them?

505
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,100
-What are they of?
-They're just tattoos.

506
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,037
The man's got a maze on his skin.

507
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,130
Why wouId he do that?

508
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,403
Why wouId he put a maze on his skin?

509
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,278
It's a pathway.

510
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,813
Where does it Iead?

511
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,746
HeIIo, roomie.

512
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,751
You were right about my tattoo.

513
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,447
It is a path, just Iike you thought.

514
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:45,860
And I need you to remember
when you saw it, Haywire.

515
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,424
I need you to remember
what it Iooked Iike.

516
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,693
Do you think you can do that for me?

517
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,002
Who are you?
