1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,991
(man) previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,548
It's the onIy buiIding on top of those tunneIs.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,633
AII we gotta do is get in there, on PI,
and dig ourseIves an on-ramp.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,150
I'm gonna find out, you know,
what it is you're doing up there.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,789
If we taIked about who had motive
to kiII Terrence, we'd be here aII day.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,555
- To do with EcoFieId?
- Do the math. CEO gets indicted for fraud.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,154
Investors start Iosing money. Lots of money.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,029
- CaII Nick Savrinn. Works for Project Justice.
- They're here.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,795
(Linc) Who's here? LJ? LJ!

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,150
- You gotta come get me.
- We can't, we're not in Chicago. Come to us.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,913
- First of the month's coming up, John.
- Yeah. So?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,958
I checked my baIance.
It's Iooking deficient.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,679
ApparentIy Fibonacci's
coming up for air again.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,958
If he testifies at that hearing
a Iot of peopIe are going down,

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,393
incIuding me.

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,438
Listen. There, uh...
there's been a restructuring.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,355
This comes from philly himself.
So l'm the man in here now.

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,829
What the heII are you doin'? Aargh!

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,434
(Michael) Uh-oh. We got a problem.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,150
BeIIick? What's going on?

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,152
That's PI. I run it.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,875
Not any more, you don't.

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,836
BeIIick.

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,798
- Hey, boss.
- Check that voIume, inmate.

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,112
We've been doing business too Iong.
We can fix this thing, right?

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,716
Let's get something cIear. You and I haven't
done crap. FaIzone's the one payin' me.

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,554
He's just an enveIope. You've been
doing business with me face to face.

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,916
You think I Iike getting piss thrown at me?
Spit on?

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,632
Other chumps might do it for 40 grand a year
and the IittIe uniform, but I'm not that dumb.

30
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,077
FaIzone's enveIope is the onIy reason
I come through that fence every day.

31
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,948
And it's the onIy reason
I'm gonna keep coming through that fence

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,759
untiI I have enough money
to buy a house on Lake Gray.

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,594
I'm thinking earIy retirement, John.
And you're interfering with that.

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,549
Hey, boss. Just give me some time and I can
match whatever FaIzone's paying you.

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,996
You're out of business. Get used to it.

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,958
Hey, boss. Boss!

37
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,469
They're gonna find it. The Ionger they're
in there, the sooner they're gonna find it.

38
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,869
Then we gotta get back in there.

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,669
- I'm gonna say something crazy to you now.
- Surprise, surprise.

40
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,311
- I don't give a damn about that Fibonacci.
- You're right. That is crazy.

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,075
Because I got bigger things to think about,
Iike survivaI.

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,110
You see, I'm kinda short on friends in here,
in case you haven't noticed.

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,716
I need to get out, right now.
WhiIe I've stiII got my Iife.

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,109
Then why are we taIking about Fibonacci?

45
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,557
The onIy way I can get that room back
is if I can prove to FaIzone I'm stiII worthy,

46
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,870
that I've stiII got what it takes. Yeah?

47
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,875
And the onIy way I can do that
is if I can give him Fibonacci.

48
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,791
Interesting.

49
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,635
You see, this is not
a me-versus-you thing any more. This is us.

50
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,395
An us thing, aII right? It's us for the escape.

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,314
Is it? Or is this about you getting back
in good with the Mob again?

52
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,436
That Iife is over for me, fish.

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,795
I mean, they cIipped my wings.

54
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,873
They want me to rot in here,
so I got no aIIegiance to them any more.

55
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,077
And yet you stiII want to do them a favour.

56
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,754
FaIzone is desperate.

57
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,310
See, if Fibonacci testifies
in front of the Congress next month,

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,994
FaIzone's gonna go down in fIames.

59
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,993
But if we give him Fibonacci,
he wiII give us anything.

60
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,318
Anything. IncIuding that very speciaI room.

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,598
What do you say, fish?

62
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,715
''And the Lord said unto Satan,
'Hast thou considered my servant Job?'''

63
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,157
'''That there is none Iike him in the earth.
A perfect and an upright man.'''

64
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,596
'''One that fears God and shuns eviI.'''

65
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,191
- Give him up.
- They'II kiII him.

66
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,239
- Maybe he deserves it.
- That's just it. He doesn't.

67
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,595
Who is this guy? You toId me he was Mafia.

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,275
He was working for the Mafia.
He just didn't know it.

69
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,592
Otto Fibonacci is... He's just Iike you.

70
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,151
An innocent man,
caught in the wrong pIace at the wrong time.

71
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,870
(man) What are you doing?
You know I didn't steaI from you, John.

72
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,952
(Michael) He was management
at one of Abruzzi's warehouses.

73
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,238
Just a normal guy-
working class, religious.

74
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,835
Hey, Nicky. Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Sh.

75
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,229
What did I teII you about taIking?

76
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,390
(Mickey) John, pIease.

77
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,515
Johnny, pIease! No!

78
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,311
(Michael) Somebody that couldn't
turn his back on murder.

79
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,792
He realised that Abruzzi and Falzone,
the men he worked for, were killers.

80
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,509
He had the key to their dealings
that could put them away for life.

81
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,512
And now he's in witness protection for life.

82
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,070
The judge asked why he was coming forward
with this information.

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,311
He said it was because
he thought it was the right thing to do.

84
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,070
What's the right thing to do now, MichaeI?

85
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,435
I don't know.

86
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,513
But if I don't give him up,
this whoIe thing's over.

87
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,679
What you're teIIing me is if... if I'm to Iive...

88
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,754
A good man has to die.

89
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,312
(phone rings)

90
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,633
- KeIIerman.
- (woman) You're where we discussed?

91
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,998
Yes. I'm stiII not exactIy sure
why we're here, but...

92
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,072
- A friend of mine shouId be aIong shortIy.
- A friend?

93
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,355
Just to see where you are with things.

94
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,716
We're cIear on where we are.
Everything's under controI.

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,872
Nothing wiII affect tomorrow,
if you're worried.

96
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,273
l'm not worried about tomorrow.
My friend is a problem solver, that's all.

97
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,352
He's there at your disposaI if you need him.

98
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,116
Do me a favour,
make him feeI Iike part of the team, hm?

99
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,274
TaIk soon.

100
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,794
- What?
- She's bringing someone in.

101
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,917
- What does that mean?
- Something in her tone changed.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,275
You think she knows about the kid?

103
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,669
We don't know that.

104
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,194
We shouIdn't have toId her we had the kid.

105
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,512
What is it you don't understand? We teII her
that kid got away, we are not here now.

106
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,754
- I swear to God, it gets deeper and deeper.
- What is that supposed to mean?

107
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,673
It means, if I'd have known
how this was gonna turn out,

108
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,752
I'd have got some crap job with the feds.
Pushed penciIs.

109
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,391
Drank coffee aII day Iong behind a desk.
God, that sounds good.

110
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,156
Keep taIking Iike that, I'm gonna be forced
to put a buIIet in your head.

111
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,756
As for her friend, whoever that is,

112
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,516
we find out what he wants,
we pIay nice, we deaI with it accordingIy.

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,116
MichaeI, you better see this.

114
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,630
(whistles) Jersey! Are you putting
that carpet in the guards' room?

115
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,836
Yeah, I think so.

116
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,117
- When?
- We gotta tear up the oId stuff first.

117
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,636
As soon as we're done with that.
Tonight, tomorrow maybe.

118
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,633
They're gonna find it, bro.
They're gonna find the hoIe.

119
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,915
We gotta do something.

120
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,668
Linc. Chow.

121
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,914
- What's this?
- It's for, you know...

122
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,831
your Iast meaI.

123
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,388
Write down what you want.

124
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,478
Linc, you gotta write something down.

125
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,552
I ain't gotta do nothin'.

126
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,510
If you don't fiII it out, aII they're gonna
give you is what's on chow for that day.

127
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,434
- So?
- You don't want that for your Iast meaI, man.

128
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,999
Hm?

129
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,513
In case you think of something.

130
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,191
Hey, Eyetie.

131
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,353
Something you need there, rug head?

132
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,669
Yeah, ajob, man.

133
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,150
Why don't you hit the DQ down the street?
We're not hiring.

134
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,312
I'II put a hundred in your kick every month.

135
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,391
You wanna pay me to work?

136
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,713
I've been in the kitchen for eight months.
I scrub one more tray, I'm gonna go j cat.

137
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,791
Hey! FioreIIo, how about it?

138
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,552
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,917
150.

140
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,949
Sign me up, then, baby.

141
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,915
I was thinking about what you said -

142
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,115
that it's not a me-versus-you thing,

143
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,078
it's an us thing.

144
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,197
- That's right.
- How far are you wiIIing to go with that?

145
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,512
- As far as I have to.
- Then set up a meeting with FaIzone.

146
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,160
I wanna taIk to him directIy.

147
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,192
FaIzone doesn't taIk to guys Iike you directIy.

148
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,670
If he wants Fibonacci, he's gonna have to.

149
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,957
No, no. No, you heard me right.

150
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,952
(Falzone) This kid is gonna give up
Fibonacci? Sure?

151
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,431
I'm definite. OnIy one thing,
he wants to meet with you directIy.

152
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,479
(Falzone) Son of a bitch.
You actually did something right. That's good.

153
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,156
Guess l'll have to call off those guys
l hired to shank you.

154
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,118
- That was a joke, John.
- Funny.

155
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,475
Good. l'll come out there this afternoon.

156
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,838
And, John, if l come all the way out there
and this turns out to be a waste of my time,

157
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,117
l'm gonna castrate you.
l hope you understand that.

158
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,237
- Be well, my friend.
- I Iove you too.

159
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,396
He's coming.

160
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,630
Don't mess this up.

161
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,151
(phone rings)

162
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,633
- HeIIo?
- It's me.

163
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,234
I know. I saw ''Inmate'' on the caIIer ID.

164
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,357
Remember when I said
I might be caIIing you on Fibonacci?

165
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,116
- Yes.
- Well... it's time.

166
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,799
- You seem distracted.
- Got a Iot on my mind, I guess.

167
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,552
Yeah?

168
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,757
Have anything to do with
the peopIe who took these toes?

169
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,274
- Nice fIowers.
- Right.

170
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,077
- Do we have an admirer?
- They're from my father.

171
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,388
Ah.

172
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,199
- What's the occasion?
- It's my birthday.

173
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,078
- Today?
- Mm-hm.

174
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,993
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

175
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,551
OK.

176
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,631
Huh.

177
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,748
Nothing. Birthday's aren't usuaIIy
a sore subject, that's aII.

178
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,718
UnIess the ceIebrant is feeIing her age,

179
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,076
which I don't see how you couId be.

180
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,119
I'm 29 years oId, MichaeI.
I'm not feeIing my age.

181
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,670
It's just, out of those 29 birthdays,
my father has managed to see me

182
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,797
on preciseIy six of them.

183
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,395
So, I get fIowers instead.

184
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,712
FIowers that end up dead
and in the trash a week Iater.

185
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,349
- That sounded bitter, huh?
- Kind of.

186
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,035
It's not a big deaI.
You are aII set. I wiII see you tomorrow.

187
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,270
OK.

188
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,714
I'm sorry you feeI that way.

189
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,670
About the fIowers, I mean.

190
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,154
- Hey, I want these in the other room.
- I got it, boss.

191
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,959
Hey, chiII, IiIy white. I got it.

192
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,553
Come on,
I know you're around here somewhere.

193
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,714
(floor creaks)

194
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,636
- (Nick) He's not doing weII, is he?
- (Veronica) He just Iost his mother.

195
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,871
Ten days from now, he Ioses his father.

196
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,114
(Nick) How are you hoIding up?

197
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,349
You know, I...

198
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,433
I sort of get
what you're going through here, LJ.

199
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,189
No disrespect, but I don't know that you do.

200
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,430
No, with my dad,

201
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,717
I was in the same spot when I was your age.

202
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,715
He was in prison,
and Iike your dad, he was innocent.

203
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,157
What happened?
I mean, you know, at the end.

204
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,312
What I hope happens here -
he got exonerated.

205
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,079
- What did they say he did?
- A Iot of bad things.

206
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,709
They weren't true, and we proved that.

207
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,475
Every day. Every day was a Iost cause,
but we kept fighting.

208
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,509
I mean, what eIse are you gonna do when you
Iove somebody? Let them go out Iike that?

209
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,831
So you fight. You keep fighting.

210
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,480
You never give up.

211
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,790
We're gonna beat this thing.

212
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,313
OK?

213
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,556
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

214
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,518
You were expecting me?
A mutuaI friend arranged it.

215
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,955
- Yes.
- You mind if I...?

216
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,758
PIease.

217
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,512
Hey, how are...

218
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,591
(whistles)

219
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,591
- (Kellerman) I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.
- Quinn.

220
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,797
Mr Quinn,
mind teIIing us what we're doing here?

221
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,668
You can probabIy teII just by Iooking at me,
I'm not a wave-making sort.

222
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,513
Just think of me as a supervisor

223
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,116
who's here to make sure things are under
controI as we approach... the big event.

224
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,873
I wasn't aware that things were out of controI.

225
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,999
WeII, you'd be the one that wouId know,
wouIdn't you?

226
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,350
WeII, the reason I'm here is because
there's a discrepancy between what you know

227
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,795
and what you have said to the vice president.

228
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,634
The Iawyers you tried to bIow up
are stiII heaIthy as thoroughbreds.

229
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,599
You know it, I know it.
Same thing goes with the kid,

230
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,674
who you were siIIy enough to teII the oId Iady
that you were actuaIIy in possession of.

231
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,797
Everything that I'm saying
is boiIing down to this.

232
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,000
You gotta hand the reins over to me now,
so that I can save your ass.

233
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,189
First of aII...

234
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,633
No! No.

235
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,757
See, now you made me make a wave.

236
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,352
You and your partner are off the job
untiI further notice.

237
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,113
It doesn't come from me
or from the White House -

238
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,749
it comes from the company. You understand?

239
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,710
Your proximaI and middIe phaIanx are
broken. Ice it for 45 minutes then spIint it.

240
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,670
That's what a doctor wouId teII you to do,
so you don't need to go see one.

241
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,557
EcoFieId's SEC fiIings.

242
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,952
Steadman was murdered so information
from his indictment wouIdn't be pubIic.

243
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,079
Sure, but we have no way of knowing
what they were trying to cover up.

244
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,039
Steadman's wife said there were
hundreds of miIIions of doIIars at stake.

245
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,795
So I figure we foIIow the money
and see where it takes us.

246
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,440
109 miIIion, 212 miIIion.

247
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,954
Over haIf a biIIion doIIars I've found so far

248
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,510
in federaI grants to EcoFieId
for aIternative fueI research.

249
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,750
- That is a heII of a Iot.
- But for what?

250
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,308
Not onIy did the company
never make a profit,

251
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,073
as far as I can teII, they never made anything.

252
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,993
No fueI saIes, no patents,
no findings, nothing.

253
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,310
So EcoFieId was a sham. It was a cover.

254
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,073
The question is, for what?

255
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,111
(buzzer)

256
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,191
PhiIIy.

257
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,915
Sit down, kid.

258
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,837
So...

259
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,753
Fibonacci - how'd you find him?

260
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,479
I did my homework.

261
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,911
You get eIIipticaI with me
for one more second and I wiII canceI you.

262
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,549
- You understand me?
- Give it up, fish.

263
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,273
Before someone's transferred to the marshaIs
and pIaced in protection,

264
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,832
they're guarded by a IocaI sheriff
from the county where the triaI wiII take pIace.

265
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,559
(phone rings)

266
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,110
- Sheriff SoIomon, pIease.
- (woman) please hold.

267
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,873
Andrew Solomon here.

268
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,718
(Michael) lf the sheriff was available,
he wasn't the one guarding Fibonacci.

269
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,759
- (woman) putnam County Sheriff's Office.
- Yeah, is Sheriff Pronzo there?

270
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,673
l'm sorry. Sheriff pronzo's on vacation.

271
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,671
- ReaIIy?
- Yes, sir.

272
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,228
There are onIy four sheriffs in the county.

273
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,950
Since Pronzo was the onIy one not in his
office, and his wife and kids were at home,

274
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,157
I knew the onIy vacation
he was taking was with Fibonacci.

275
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,550
Watching him
tiII they couId put him in protection.

276
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,713
Thing is, sometimes it takes weeks
for the marshaIs to set up a new identity,

277
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,032
so some IocaI sheriff is stuck
in the middIe of nowhere with Fibonacci.

278
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,113
He gets IoneIy and caIIs home - a Iot.

279
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,150
l called the phone company,
said l was pronzo and l'd lost my bill.

280
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,310
l asked for another copy.

281
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,077
Mrs pronzo was receiving dozens of calls
from an area code a long way from Chicago.

282
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,433
I went onIine,
reverse-traced the number, and voiI¨¤:

283
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,512
there was Fibonacci's exact Iocation.

284
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,354
- How do you know he's stiII there?
- I have someone Iooking after him.

285
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,069
- Watching from afar, in case he moves.
- Mm-hm.

286
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,390
- This is about money, isn't it?
- You're an astute man.

287
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,439
- What?
- Your friend here is trying to extort me.

288
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,832
Not extortion, insurance.
I pIan on being out of here one day.

289
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,515
I don't think my new r¨¦sum¨¦
is gonna cut it in most pIaces.

290
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,716
- How much?
- 200,000.

291
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,277
- I'm gonna kiII you.
- Quid pro quo.

292
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,794
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

293
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,111
WeII, I'II give you some quid pro quo.

294
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,878
(Michael) Where did you get this?

295
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,349
Who took this?

296
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,718
Since you took it upon yourseIf to have
peopIe watch our interests on the outside,

297
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,429
we took it upon ourseIves
to have some peopIe watching yours.

298
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,913
So who's it gonna be?
Fibonacci or your pretty IittIe girIfriend there?

299
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:42,798
Yeah, you shouId be carefuI with who
visits you in here, fish. These waIIs have eyes.

300
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,629
If you touch her,

301
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,439
I'II kiII you myseIf.

302
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,718
One, that is an empty threat.
You are Iess than a gnat to me.

303
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,031
And two,
aII you gotta do is give me the address

304
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,759
and we avoid aII this meIodrama aItogether.

305
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,597
The address, you gnat.

306
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,830
Now.

307
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,471
Promise me...

308
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,394
promise me it'II be quick and painIess.

309
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,190
- Do you beIieve this guy?
- Promise me.

310
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:25,479
If the next thing that comes out
of your mouth is not that address,

311
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,916
there's gonna be a Iot of pain...
in a Iot of pIaces.

312
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,069
Canada.

313
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,072
345 HamiIton Avenue,

314
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,991
Thunder Bay, Ontario.

315
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,150
Get outta here.

316
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,351
Nice work, John.

317
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,879
I guess the demise of John Abruzzi
was greatIy exaggerated.

318
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,428
Thank you. I appreciate it.

319
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,990
CouId you do me a favour
and fix this BeIIick thing for me?

320
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,193
Yeah, consider it done.

321
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,749
Thank you. And PhiIIy.

322
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,229
Before you puII the trigger,

323
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:37,190
Iook that son of a bitch in his eyes
and teII him John Abruzzi said goodbye.

324
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,190
OK.

325
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,677
''In the race toward worIdwide peace
and prosperity, America wiII set the pace.''

326
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,752
''Race''? Rat race, arms race...

327
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,638
Can you think of a word
with a worse connotation?

328
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,154
Fix it.

329
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,629
(Kellerman) Did you send me a baby-sitter?

330
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,395
- This is not the time or the pIace.
- This is the time and the pIace.

331
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,472
Don't take that tone.
Remember who you are taIking to.

332
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,596
I am vice president of this country.

333
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,276
No, actuaIIy you're CaroIine ReynoIds
from Montgomery, IIIinois.

334
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,590
I know exactIy who you are.

335
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,194
Come with me.

336
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,271
Just...

337
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,028
There is something you need to understand.

338
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,795
If you had done yourjob,
I never wouId've had to ask for Quinn.

339
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,872
And there's something
you need to understand.

340
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,396
You woke a sIeeping beast
when you caIIed these guys in.

341
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,758
They have a bigger agenda than us and get
nasty quick if things don't go their way.

342
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,070
So now no one is safe -

343
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,720
not you, not me.

344
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:18,870
Let's not overreact. I mean, I know everyone
is nervous about tomorrow. I understand that.

345
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,512
But the one thing both of us have to
remember is that we are in this together, OK?

346
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,196
AII I'm saying is these guys are into this thing
now, and there's no going back.

347
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,795
That's bad news for everyone.

348
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,476
Sebastian BaIfour?

349
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,956
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm Nestor PoIIack.

350
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,349
Midwestern Life and CasuaIty.

351
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,874
I'm aIready covered. Thanks.

352
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,555
- No, I'm here to discuss Veronica Donovan.
- What about her?

353
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,998
We've been trying to track her down with
respect to the damage from the expIosion.

354
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,232
- ExpIosion?
- You didn't know. Oh, I'm sorry.

355
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,552
It's just that her records,
they Iist you as her fianc¨¦, so I assumed...

356
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,599
- HoId on. Is Veronica OK?
- WeII, there has been a fataIity.

357
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,277
But the medicaI examiners haven't been abIe
to identify the remains with any certainty,

358
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:29,309
so Veronica couId be OK, we just can't
find her. We were hoping you couId heIp.

359
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,031
Rozz.

360
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,830
Reese.

361
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,114
Burrows.

362
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,631
BIueberry pancakes, huh?

363
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,711
AII right, man. You got it.

364
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,756
BIueberry pancakes.

365
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,549
(beeping)

366
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,229
(Falzone) 341...

367
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,711
345.

368
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,918
This is it.

369
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,596
AII right, that's it, kids.
Time for bed. Give me a kiss.

370
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,435
Are you OK down there?

371
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,909
Night-night.

372
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,958
AII right, sweetheart. Give me a kiss.

373
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,672
- The kids are down.
- Thanks.

374
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,275
Tonight we send a message, gentIemen.

375
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,751
We are gonna hurt him and his famiIy
the way he hurt ours.

376
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,916
- Oh, honey.
- Yeah?

377
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,549
- Can you change the timer on the sprinkIer?
- OK.

378
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,232
- Love you.
- Love you too.

379
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,589
(siren)

380
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,989
(man) Freeze!

381
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,000
PoIice! Drop your weapons!

382
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,512
Drop it!

383
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,231
Down!

384
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,239
Hi, it's John. You wanted to taIk to me?

385
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,436
(Maggio) Yeah. You hear the news?

386
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,478
Falzone got popped last night, up in Canada.

387
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,678
lnternational gun charges, parole violation...

388
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,320
He's in deep.

389
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,798
- You threw away your fIowers.
- Like I said, they don't Iast.

390
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,238
I don't think they're dead yet.

391
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,512
I don't Iike getting attached to things
if I know they won't Iast.

392
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,479
- There you go.
- Why are you so cynicaI?

393
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,879
- I think there's cynicism and there's reaIism.
- And there's optimism. Hope, faith.

394
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,111
Coming from an eight-toed guy
Iocked in a penitentiary?

395
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,760
Toes are overrated.

396
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,832
Thank you for trying to make me smiIe.
Not today.

397
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,957
- You never know.
- We're aII set.

398
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,678
You and I have a Iot to taIk about,
don't we, fish?

399
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,833
Seems PhiIIy FaIzone
ran into some probIem up in Canada

400
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,753
just because of the information you gave him.

401
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,550
- What kind of troubIe?
- InternationaI gun charges, paroIe vioIation.

402
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,995
He's gonna go away for a Iong time.

403
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,753
How do you feeI about that?

404
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,479
Pretty darn good.

405
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,476
- And what about PI?
- We got that back too.

406
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,711
FaIzone paid BeIIick yesterday,
so we're good. For now.

407
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,950
- It aII worked out.
- Sure did.

408
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,873
NiceIy done. You're a heII of an actor.

409
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,632
Thank you.

410
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,870
This heIped. It's nice.

411
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,712
Nice shot.

412
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,030
Where did you take it?

413
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,669
It's LincoIn's from back in the day.
A camping trip or something.

414
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,832
- So when do we get back in that room?
- Right away.

415
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,753
- WeII, Iet's get to it.
- Yeah.

416
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,638
Oh, there's one more thing.

417
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,798
You are gonna give me Fibonacci
once we're outside these waIIs, right?

418
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,598
Of course.

419
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,715
Thank you.

420
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,473
And I think I'II keep this,

421
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,279
as insurance.

422
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,598
- (Linc) Juice?
- Why can't we have breakfast every day?

423
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,275
You shouId have breakfast every day, LJ.
It's an important meaI.

424
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,999
No, why can't I have breakfast with
you every day?

425
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,310
Nothing wouId make me happier.

426
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,439
But your mommy and me,
we don't Iive together any more.

427
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,114
Why?

428
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,872
WeII, uh...

429
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,033
sometimes that happens
with mommies and daddies.

430
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,192
But you know what?
You're the Iuckiest boy in the worId,

431
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,874
because your mommy Ioves you very much

432
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,030
and I Iove you very much.

433
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,272
I teII you what, how about every Sunday
we have our own speciaI breakfast?

434
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,397
- Just you and me. Yeah?
- Yeah.

435
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,471
- LittIe bit or a handfuI?
- HandfuI.

436
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,357
HandfuI.

437
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,391
Here we go.

438
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,479
Take a waIk.

439
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,197
Anyone eIse want to waIk with him?

440
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,396
Yeah.

441
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,753
- This is my game.
- Looks Iike our friend got his throne back.

442
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,149
Looks Iike it.

443
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,599
Something teIIs me
we may have you to thank for that.

444
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,671
- You don't want to know.
- Right.

445
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,196
Stretch your Iegs, oId head.

446
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,673
Now, we got a heII of a Iot
to taIk about, don't we?

447
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,510
I got nothing to say.

448
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,034
You think you can pIay me, snowfIake?

449
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,350
Cos you got coIIege?

450
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,635
Big-schooI Iearning, huh?

451
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,508
WeII, Iet me schooI you.
Darwin wins inside these waIIs.

452
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,878
Not Einstein, Darwin.

453
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,030
(guard) Yard time's over, Iadies.

454
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,554
Let's Iine it up.

455
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,029
I'm not done with you, fish.

456
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,111
You never even got started.

457
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,191
AII right.

458
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,590
We're through the hard part.
Another 18 inches, we'II hit that pipe.

459
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,069
- We'II be there by Friday.
- Friday?

460
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,755
- Better start making traveI arrangements.
- Maricruz, here I come.

461
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,638
- (Abruzzi) Sardinia.
- Where are we going?

462
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,472
- Panama.
- Panama.

463
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,996
Panama. Darien Gap, south of the canaI.

464
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,117
No roads, no eIectricity, no cops.

465
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,515
Nothing but white sand beaches
and ice-coId beer.

466
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,310
- WeII, that's nice, but what about our Iives?
- WeII, we'II open a scuba shop.

467
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,709
- Hey, I don't dive.
- Neither do I.

468
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,155
We'II have pIenty of time to Iearn.

469
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,520
BuIIs.

470
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,596
This con says he's on ajob in here.

471
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,797
- I don't think so.
- You heard the paisano. Move your ass.

472
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,440
CO, hoId on one second.

473
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,797
Now, are you sure about that?
Are you sure you can't use an extra hand?

474
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,553
You know anything about construction?

475
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,030
Concrete is my speciaIty. Can you dig it?

476
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,556
OK, boss. Sign him up.

477
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,108
You got it.

478
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,713
Now it Iooks Iike Darwin wins after aII,
eh, fish?

479
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,510
I have a Iot of dots,
but no way to connect them.

480
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,398
- Nobody's getting rich.
- What about sharehoIders?

481
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,994
Profits were aII converted back to shares.

482
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,753
Looks Iike they subcontracted out
some research -

483
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,355
it's pennies in the scheme of things.
Nobody got earIy retirement.

484
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,876
But you can't hide $500 miIIion
by moving a few decimaI points.

485
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,273
ln a move anticipated by many, Reynolds
announced she is running for the presidency.

486
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,636
She made the announcement
from her hometown of Montgomery.

487
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,317
The move toward worldwide peace
and prosperity is a marathon, not a sprint,

488
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,871
but l assure you,
America will be setting the pace.

489
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,748
$0.5 biIIion doesn't disappear.
You couId run a smaII country with that.

490
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,072
The vice president is reported to have
the largest campaign war chest in history.

491
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,596
lt is so large, in fact,
prognosticators are already casting her

492
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,274
as the favourite in the presidential race.

493
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,158
Maybe not a smaII country.

494
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,708
Maybe this one.

495
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,513
