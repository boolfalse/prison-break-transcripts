00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,572
I wouId pick up the phone right now
if I thought there was any chance

157
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,943
that I couId make a difference,
but you have to understand,

158
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,751
I'm the Iast person in the worId
that my father Iistens to.

159
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,514
He hates what I do,
he hates what I beIieve in.

160
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:54,059
And if I'm the one asking for cIemency
for your brother, your brother won't get it.

161
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,406
I'm sorry.

162
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,816
Look, if Terrence Steadman
is stiII aIive, LyIe,

163
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,787
then it can't be Terrence Steadman
buried in the ground.

164
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,291
Yeah, but a secret informant
cIaims that Steadman is stiII aIive?

I don't know, Nick.
It aII sounds pretty far-fetched.

You're his cIerk, just get us on the docket.

167
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,198
Nick, you're asking him
to commit poIiticaI suicide

168
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,896
by granting a stay of execution to
IIIinois' most notorious death row inmate.

OfficiaIIy, aII we're asking
is for an exhumation order.

170
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,142
If he grants it, he can order a stay
untiI the tests come in.

171
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,767

aII you can reaIIy do is pray it goes quick.

209
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:49,860
Once, about 10 years ago,
there was a man caught a few sparks,

210
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,697
not enough to do the job.

211
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,401

whiIe they reset the whoIe process.

212
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,845
And it may sound crazy, but he said
it was the worst three weeks of his Iife,

213
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,575
because it's not the Iightning

Mr. Burrows' case has been tainted

305
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,317
by conspiracy characterized
by destruction of evidence,

306
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,484
distortion of the truth
and witness intimidation.

307
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,459
Again, Judge, I have to object.

308
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,760
These are some serious accusations
with absoIuteIy no proof.

309
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,391
No proof? What have I been arguing
for the past 20 minutes?

310
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:38,560
You got me.

311
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,467
Judge KessIer, Mr. Tucci
might not appreciate the weight

312
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,803
of what we've just presented,
but sureIy you must.

313
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,174
As Miss Donovan stated,
a top video forensic anaIyst

314
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,712
has disputed the authenticity
of a surveiIIance tape

315
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,146
that was the key piece of evidence
in convicting LincoIn Burrows.

316
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,241
That's the tape
that no Ionger exists, right?

317
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,183
Because your cIient had it destroyed.

318
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,849
UnIess my cIient is a rusted water pipe
in the County Records Office,

319
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,050
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

320
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,821
Judge, Miss Donovan's apartment
was bIown up in an attempt

321
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,396
to siIence both her and me.

322
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,830
That was independentIy corroborated
as a gas Ieak, Your Honor.

323
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,128
Judge, a month ago,
a Secret Service agent

324
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,431
named PauI KeIIerman visited my office.

325
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:17,497
I saw KeIIerman Iast night, when he shot
and kiIIed another agent, DanieI HaIe,

326
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:21,045
right after HaIe toId me that
Terrence Steadman was aIive and weII.

327
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,809
Your Honor, I'm presenting to the cIerk
an affidavit from the director

328
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,816
of the Secret Service Agency.

329
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,785
It states that at no time
has there ever been

330
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:34,151
an agent of that organization by the name
of PauI KeIIerman, or DanieI HaIe.

331
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,228
In addition, there were no other witnesses
to this shooting.

332
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,958
No buIIets were found, no bIood,
no sheII casings.

333
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:44,900
The onIy witness to this aIIeged murder
is Veronica Donovan,

334
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,834
LincoIn Burrows' ex-girIfriend.

335
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,100
Now, Your Honor, I feeI for Miss Donovan.

336
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,675
-Save it.
-I do.

337
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,106
But desperation causes desperate acts.

338
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,681
And that's what we're seeing here today,
Your Honor.

339
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,945
My cIient,
the Vice-President of the United States...

340
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,485
Judge KessIer.

341
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,224
Do either of you have any evidence
that is admissibIe?

342
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,225
Even just tangibIe?

343
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,817
Your cIaims, if true, are terrifying.

344
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,796
But anything or anyone
that couId verify your story

345
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,389
is either gone, missing or dead.

346
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:25,172
I know time is of the essence.
I'II reserve judgment for now.

347
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,968
I'II take your arguments
into consideration,

348
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,604
and I'II have a decision within a few hours.

349
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:40,684
These IittIe bastards are the bane
of my existence, I swear to God.

350
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:41,983
You get this a Iot?

351
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,993
Yeah, they're attracted to the heat
when they're coId,

352
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,858
pIus, they got coIIapsibIe vertebrae
or some deaI,

353
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,558
so they can squeeze through a crack
yea big, if they're determined.

354
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,794
And he shorted out the wire
just by biting on it?

355
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:54,531
Not by chewing on the wire aIone,
but if the taiI touches metaI,

356
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,904
it acts as a ground, and boom, fuse pops.

357
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,740
-AIong with the rat.
-I'II be damned.

358
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,574
So, can you change the fuse?

359
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,478
Yeah, there's another one right here
in the box.

360
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:05,776
Can you do it now?

361
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,682
Right after I notify the state
and fiII out the paperwork.

00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,190
it feIt Iike we were oIder.

458
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:38,092
lt was so clear, The whole dream,

459
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,462
And when l woke,

460
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,374
l knew that today
wasn"t going to be the end,

461
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,669
That...

462
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,113
That we'II see each other again, Dad.

463
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,213
l know it,

464
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,619
I Iove you, Dad.

465
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,130
Those numbers support Burrows' cIaim

466
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,462
about Terrence Steadman's
pending indictment.

467
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:14,026
Now, with the reIated murders,
and then the confidentiaI informant,

468
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,164
I just wanted to make sure that
you were fuIIy aware of the circumstances.

469
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,072
I'm fuIIy acquainted
with the Burrows case, Sara,

470
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,667
but I never heard about any of this.

471
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,838
WeII, I hadn't either, untiI I spoke
with Burrows' attorneys this afternoon.

472
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,540
And I understand
that most of this evidence

473
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,245
is technicaIIy considered circumstantiaI,
but I think you'II agree it's hard to ignore.

474
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,877
And how did you get invoIved
with aII this?

475
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,456
These men are my patients.
It's my job to advocate for them.

476
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,083
Come on, Sara. How many of these guys
say that they are innocent?

477
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,559
Eighty, ninety percent?

478
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,256
It's not Iike you're asking me
for a new bike here, kid.

479
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,297
Being tough on crime,
capitaI punishment,

480
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,962
it's aII part of a phiIosophy
that I beIieve in.

481
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:50,370
Part of a phiIosophy that I campaigned on,
was eIected for.

482
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,575
I have to go back to Fox River.

483
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,407
I have to be there when they kiII this man.

484
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,245
The Ieast you couId do is review his case.

485
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,481
And, Dad, if it heIps,
pretend it didn't come from me.

486
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:15,263
I've never given a damn
about what peopIe thought of me.

487
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,766
Never. The Iast coupIe of days...

488
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,227
I gotta admit, you know...

489

(LINCOLN SIGHING)

490
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,707
Lee Harvey OswaId, John WiIkes Booth,

491
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,170
LincoIn Burrows.

492
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,606
I'm gonna go down in history
with these freaks.

493
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,220
Bitch of it aII is I didn't do it.

494
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,689
I didn't do it!

495
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,064
(DOOR OPENING)

496
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,666
I didn't do it.

497
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,991
It's time.

498
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,930
Warden!

499
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,068
-What is it?
-It's the Governor.

500
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,447
Yes, Governor.

501
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,032
Okay. I understand.

502
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,702
The Governor has
reviewed your case fuIIy.

503
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,466
He's not granting cIemency.

504
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:44,780
Let's proceed.

505
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:02,322
You did your country and your party
a great service.

506
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,297
It won't go unnoticed.

507
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,839
-Thank you, Madam Vice President.
-Thank you, Governor.

508
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,852
Can't go past here.

509
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:33,426
Once he's in the death chamber,
you'II be escorted to the viewing room.

510
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,028
Can I...

511
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,360
Yeah.

512
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,516
I've Ioved you
since the first time I saw you.

513
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,390
Uncuff him.

514
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,315
Let's go, son.

515
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,493
LINCOLN: l didn"t kill that man, Michael,
SCOFIELD: Swear to me,

516
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:47,662
LINCOLN: l swear to you, Michael,

517
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,439
Preparation can only take you so far,

518
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:55,043
After that,
you gotta take a few leaps of faith,

519
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,817
VERONICA: Don"t give up on me,

520
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,620
-What if something happens to you?
-You just have a little faith,

521
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,789
Just have a little faith,

522
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,054
How about every Sunday,
we have our own special breakfast?

523
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,218
-Just you and me,
-Yeah,

524

LINCOLN: Give me your hand,
You gotta have faith, LJ,

LJ: l love you, Dad,

526

I came in here a man.

Give me the strength
to waIk out of here a man.
