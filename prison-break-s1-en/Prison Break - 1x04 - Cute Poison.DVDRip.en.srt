1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,153
previously:

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,834
- I didn't kiII that man.
- The evidence says you did.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,311
- I was set up.
- Put down your weapon.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,039
I find it incumbent
you see the inside of a prison ceII.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,795
- I'm Iooking for LincoIn Burrows.
- He kiIIed the vice president's brother.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,269
- Why you wanna see Burrows?
- He's my brother.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,430
- I'm getting you out.
- That's impossibIe.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,078
Not if you designed the pIace.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,754
- You've seen the bIueprints.
- Better than that.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,910
I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,673
- You find out who's trying to bury him.
- Nobody is.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,954
The evidence was cooked.

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,476
- A Iawyer's poking around.
- Anyone that's a threat is expendabIe.

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,950
ScofieId, found you a new ceIIie.
Haywire, get in here.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,759
- Someone found Fibonacci.
- Who was this someone?

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,239
Where is Fibonacci?

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,629
I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,039
Joey.

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,118
On your feet.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,350
What time is it?

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,635
- Get up.
- What's going on?

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,517
Let's go, LincoIn. On your feet.

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,318
- BeIIick.
- Come on, move it.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,949
BeIIick. BeIIick. No! BeIIick!

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,031
BeIIick!

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,070
BeIIick! Where are you taking...
BeIIick! No!

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,549
No! BeIIick, no! No! I got a month Ieft!

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,279
PIease, no, BeIIick!

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,432
BeIIick, no. BeIIick, pIease, no!

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,751
No, I got a month Ieft! PIease!

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,751
No, BeIIick...

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,311
PIease, BeIIick...

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,035
Make your peace, LincoIn.

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,271
Let's get on with it.

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,351
(door slams)

36
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,080
(man) Open 40.

37
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,191
CIose 40.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,549
Haywire, you ever thought of breaking out?

39
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,872
- What the heII wouId I do out there?
- Not be here.

40
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,750
HaIfway houses. Psych visits.
Meds. Checking in with the PO.

41
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,116
Urine tests. Keeping ajob.

42
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,795
No. Why'd you ask?

43
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,270
This guy was taIking about it in the yard.
I didn't know what to say.

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,193
TeII Officer BeIIick.

45
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,272
He'II make Iife easier for you if...

46
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,350
If what?

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,716
- Your tattoos.
- What about them?

48
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,836
What are they of? No, no, no,
what are they? Like, some kind of...

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,835
- They're just tattoos.
- (guard) Candy time, Haywire.

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,749
They think I have schizo-affective disorder
with bipoIar tendencies.

51
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,831
Think you got it?

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,433
Whatever.

53
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,110
I take the piIIs
to keep the quacks off my back.

54
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,199
Bye, now.

55
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,953
Get outta the way.

56
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,713
You know, maybe they give you
those things for a reason.

57
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,997
Yeah. To keep me duII.

58
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,834
To keep me
in their invisibIe freaking handcuffs.

59
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,309
SeriousIy. Those tattoos, they're beautifuI.

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,233
You mind if I, you know,
Iook at the whoIe thing?

61
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,153
I do, actuaIIy.

62
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,514
Why?

63
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,716
(guard) Yo. Stand cIear.

64
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,268
Does there need to be a reason?

65
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,912
Sucre.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,673
I'm not even taIking to you, man.

67
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,790
(Abruzzi) What's the probIem?

68
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,997
- Nothing I can't handIe.
- WeII, I knew there was a probIem.

69
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,516
I couId teII by Iooking at you
from across the yard.

70
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,831
Guys, didn't I say there was a probIem?

71
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,229
So what's the probIem?

72
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,199
- You're Iooking at it.
- What, Haywire?

73
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,352
Yup. He's my new ceII mate.

74
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,271
- That's a probIem.
- He doesn't sIeep.

75
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,954
- So when do you dig?
- I don't.

76
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,792
Hey, you and I are in bed now.

77
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,589
You made me a promise. You said
that we were gonna get out of here.

78
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,116
You renege now, and I'm gonna cut you.

79
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,430
So you better take care of your business.

80
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,590
Or I wiII take care of you.

81
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,830
Have a nice day.

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,072
It's reaIIy coming together, isn't it?

83
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,515
- Yup.
- You think it'II be done in time?

84
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,197
WeII, I figure we stiII have the interior aIcoves
and piIasters to do, which is no smaII task.

85
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,477
But, yes. I think so.

86
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,274
Listen, I have to say I reaIIy appreciate
aII the effort that you put into this.

87
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,115
I wish there was some way I couId,
you know, pay you, or something.

88
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,873
There is one thing you couId do for me.

89
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,989
- My ceII mate.
- The inimitabIe CharIes Patoshik. Haywire.

90
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,197
- Then you know.
- HoId it right there.

91
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,956
Officer BeIIick is in charge of ceII transfers.
You're gonna have to taIk to him about that.

92
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,157
I tried. But he seems to think
we're a good match.

93
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,596
- Has he threatened you?
- Who? Haywire or BeIIick?

94
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,075
UnfortunateIy, unIess there's
some evidence of vioIence

95
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,674
or sexuaI predation between ceII mates,

96
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,639
those kinds of requests
faII on deaf ears around here.

97
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,918
Prison system's a IittIe too crowded
for requests based on personaIity.

98
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,950
- It's not exactIy SandaIs out there.
- (knock at door)

99
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,438
Warden, sorry. Your wife is here.

100
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,275
What? She's not supposed
to be here tiII four o'cIock.

101
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,432
Becky, do not Iet her come in here
under any circumstances.

102
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,640
She's not supposed to see this
untiI our anniversary. I'II be right out.

103
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,799
Hi, sweetheart. You're earIy.

104
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,153
- Let's go eat.
- You're acting funny.

105
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,118
- I am?
- What's going on in there?

106
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,479
- Just going over some fiIes.
- Becky said you were in a meeting.

107
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,472
This isn't ToIedo aII over again, is it?

108
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,836
ToIedo? How can you say that?

109
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,558
- Then you won't mind if I Iook.
- Uh, Judy...

110
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,589
Warden, I'm not gonna be abIe to cooperate.
I'd get kiIIed if I did.

111
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,317
Johnson's stiII deciding.

112
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,358
Then you and I are done.

113
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,390
You shouId have just toId me.

114
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,711
WeII, you know how anxious I get
when you come around the inmates.

115
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,360
Becky, have a guard
escort Johnson back to his ceII.

116
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,715
I'II deaI with him Iater.
Come on, Iet's eat.

117
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,759
- What are you doing here?
- I'm your attorney.

118
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,070
I'm representing you now.

119
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,878
Hm.

120
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,918
If that's aII right with you.

121
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,039
- Last time I saw you, you caIIed me a Iiar.
- Things have changed.

122
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,559
I beIieve you now.

123
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,949
I got in touch with
Crab Simmons' ex-girIfriend, Leticia.

124
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,508
She corroborated your story.

125
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,279
- WiII she testify?
- She's missing.

126
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,954
I don't know.
I think the Secret Service got to her.

127
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,554
- Secret Service?
- They've been poking around.

128
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,313
They show up, she disappears.
What do you think?

129
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,072
Oh, man.

130
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,156
I didn't reaIise it was that high up, you know?
Do you know what we're up against?

131
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,279
I know it's a Iot more
than either of us can handIe on our own.

132
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,670
- Project Justice.
- Why have I heard of them?

133
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,672
They handIe death penaIty cases.
There's a guy, Ben Forsik.

134
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,036
I sent him copies of everything.
You couId teII him what you found.

135
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,839
Maybe it'II be enough to bring him on board.

136
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,273
OK.

137
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,437
So, uh, how's Sebastian?

138
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,716
What do you mean?

139
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,237
WeII, you being here.
I mean, is he cooI with it?

140
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,676
I haven't taIked to him.

141
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,430
The, um...

142
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,954
The engagement's off.

143
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,393
Oh.

144
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,710
Sorry.

145
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,076
You couId at Ieast say that Iike you mean it.

146
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,151
I do.

147
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,318
God, you aIways were a Iousy Iiar.

148
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,037
Yeah.

149
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,553
I better get to Project Justice.

150
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,269
Veronica.

151
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,869
Thank you. I didn't have a whoIe Iot Ieft.

152
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,520
You can thank me when I get you out of here.

153
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,431
(door buzzes)

154
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,198
Baby, it's me. Are you there?

155
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,838
HeIIo? Are you there?

156
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,391
Hey. If she is,
she obviousIy don't want to taIk to you.

157
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,273
It's Wednesday, babe.
You were gonna come around today, right?

158
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,750
Look, I gotta hang up now.
I gotta go back in the bIock, but...

159
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,673
you're gonna be here today, right?

160
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,320
I'm your man, baby, and I Iove you.

161
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,391
I do.

162
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,360
It's a pattern.

163
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,830
- What did you say?
- Your tattoo. It's a pattern.

164
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,115
You're seeing things.

165
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,715
Putting him in with Haywire is a Iow bIow.

166
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,315
What? The shrinks cIeared Haywire
for re-entry into Gen Pop.

167
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,632
- He's so doped up on meds he's Iike a kitten.
- A kitten who murdered both his parents.

168
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,190
With respect, sir,
if you give ScofieId preferentiaI treatment,

169
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,794
it'II undermine your credibiIity.

170
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,111
I know you got a soft spot for the guy
because he's got brains

171
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,079
and he's heIping you with that contraption,
but the guy's a vioIent criminaI.

172
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,993
He deserves punishment
as much as the rest of these guys.

173
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,358
You know that I'm Iess interested
in punishment than I am in rehabiIitation.

174
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,716
And sticking him in with Haywire
is not rehabiIitation in my book.

175
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,553
You deIegated authority
over Gen Pop to me, boss.

176
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,076
- I know I did.
- You gotta Iet me do my job or pass it on.

177
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,355
Now, Brian, go easy.

178
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,753
There's a reason I'm giving you
more and more responsibiIity.

179
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,675
When I retire,
I'm recommending you to take my pIace.

180
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,876
Don't make me regret it.

181
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,590
AII I'm saying is, take another Iook at the
ScofieId situation. I trust yourjudgment.

182
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,352
Yes, sir.

183
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,189
HoId up. This is supposed to be
an open visitation. Why we doing it here?

184
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,271
Ask your visitor.

185
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,873
What are you doing here? Where's Maricruz?

186
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,679
- She's not gonna be coming any more.
- Is she hurt?

187
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,719
No, no, she's fine, she's fine.
She's just, uh...

188
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,270
She's with me now.

189
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,318
She's with you now? It's ajoke, right?

190
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,949
No, she made a decision, man.
She decided she needed stabiIity.

191
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,070
- Is she gonna get that from you?
- You can think what you want about me but...

192
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,038
I'm not the one who's in prison.

193
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,317
I actuaIIy can do something for her.

194
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,153
She wanted me to taIk to you first
in case you got mad...

195
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,151
Hijo de tu madre, jte voy a matar!

196
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,196
As¨ª sea lo ultimo que hagas.

197
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,510
jDesgraciado! jTe voy a matar!

198
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,676
You just proved my point.

199
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,638
You're a con.

200
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,598
And that's aII you'II ever be.

201
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,231
Make it quick.

202
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,789
Yeah. He's right in here.

203
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,757
Take a waIk, Choppy.

204
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,350
ScofieId.
You're in a restricted area.

205
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,716
I'm doing yard work for PI.
We need some fertiIiser.

206
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,553
Then why are you in the masonry section?

207
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,155
Oh, by the way, how's the foot?

208
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,150
Don't ever go around me to the Pope again.

209
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,189
Now, move.

210
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,589
You know what, Haywire?

211
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,989
I don't think we're gonna work out.

212
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,116
And since I was here first,
I think you shouId go.

213
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,310
I crapped myseIf once in junior high.

214
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,715
During PE, we were pIaying badminton,

215
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,511
and I knew I had to waIk past a bunch of the
other students to get back to the Iocker room,

216
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,639
and so I just started waIking.

217
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,679
And I tried to make fun of it,
you know, before anyone eIse did.

218
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,274
So I turned around behind me,
and I said, ''Look, I have a taiI.''

219
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,388
I just shared a secret with you.

220
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,711
- Now it's your turn.
- You want to know what the tattoos mean?

221
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,791
- Yeah.
- Nothing.

222
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,832
(Abruzzi) Hey, fish.

223
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,593
Making any progress?

224
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,195
With SIeeping Beauty back there?
Or with the digging?

225
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,271
- Either.
- No.

226
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,433
- But I know what to do.
- Oh, yeah?

227
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,799
ProbIem is,
you don't got the stugots to do it.

228
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,515
(guard) Abruzzi, Iet's go.

229
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,511
See ya.

230
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,796
Yeah? ReaIIy?
WeII, teII the crazy son of a bitch I said hi.

231
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,394
- Wrap it up.
- How's Aunt Ruth? She out of hospitaI?

232
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,835
- Wrap it up.
- HoId on, Ma.

233
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,911
Bite me.

234
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,996
OK. We got a probIem now, man.

235
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,071
Let's handIe it then.

236
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,671
That's what I thought.

237
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,232
(phone rings)

238
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,197
- HeIIo?
- Maricruz? It's me.

239
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,078
What's going on?
What's the deaI with you and Hector?

240
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,957
- When were you gonna teII me?
- What?

241
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,429
That Rita SaIda¨¾a's been visiting you.

242
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,795
- What?
- Yeah. Hector told me.

243
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,032
Hector toId you. Of course he toId you.
Baby, that guy is a snake. He's a Iiar.

244
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,190
- Why wouId he Iie?
- Why would he lie?

245
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,637
Because he's been trying to get into your
pants since the minute we started dating.

246
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,871
You know what? I don't know what to beIieve.

247
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,155
Me, mami. BeIieve me.

248
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,038
Yeah, while l wait by the phone twice a week.

249
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,509
Baby, where is this coming from?

250
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,591
I don't know.

251
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,272
Look, there's just so many things.

252
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,717
Yesterday I went to Teresa's house,
and I saw her baby.

253
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,399
Is that what this is about?
Your cIock is ticking?

254
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,438
WeII, I am gonna be 30 in a few years.

255
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,830
You're 25. You want to get pregnant?
Let's get pregnant right now.

256
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,036
I can't get pregnant untiI I'm married.

257
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,430
We're gonna get married. In 16 months.

258
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,118
Yeah, weII, Hector says
that if something goes wrong in there,

259
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,634
you couId serve your fuII sentence.

260
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,117
I can't wait ten years.

261
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,029
l can't wait ten years, baby.

262
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,032
I'm gonna be out in 16 months.

263
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,997
Te lo prometo, mi amor.

264
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,116
But what if something does happen, huh?

265
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,589
Baby, I can't wait that Iong.

266
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,631
I can't.

267
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,511
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

268
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,869
HeIIo? Baby, wait... HeIIo?

269
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,116
Even if Leticia turned up,
her testimony wouId be worthIess.

270
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,352
By and Iarge, mostjunkies with
criminaI records don't shine on the stand.

271
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,874
I just found aII this out
in the past coupIe days.

272
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,158
I'm confident I can find out more
now that I'm devoting aII my time to the case.

273
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,074
The agent who came to visit when Leticia
was in your office, what did he want?

274
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,109
Nick, pIease. You've got to understand,
unIess there's new information for us,

275
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,237
we've aIready reviewed
Mr Burrows' case thoroughIy.

276
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,436
Do you have any new evidence?

277
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,397
- No, but I...
- But.

278
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,631
That is what you're teIIing us, right?
I need to cIarify here.

279
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,075
Yes. That is what I'm teIIing you.

280
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,472
But, Mr Forsik, you don't need to point out
what I don't have. I'm weII aware of that.

281
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,634
I'm asking for your heIp. I don't think a man
shouId be kiIIed for something he didn't do.

282
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,678
That's what it says
on your mission statement in the Iobby.

283
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,957
- We get many requests for representation.
- I'm sure you do...

284
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,999
And I have to decide which cases we're going
to devote our Iimited resources to.

285
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,355
I wiII do aII of the Iegwork, Mr Forsik,

286
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,829
but with no experience
in death penaIty cases,

287
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,072
I'm just asking you
to point me in the right direction.

288
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,119
PIease.

289
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,279
I'm sorry.

290
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,999
We just don't have the manpower.

291
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,591
Thank you for your time.

292
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,236
She's just Ieaving now.

293
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,392
It'II take her a haIf-hour
to get across town in this traffic.

294
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,595
We're not gonna need nearIy that much time.

295
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,318
I've turned up quite a bit aIready.

296
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,397
Hey. Hey, have you seen my toothpaste?

297
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,994
- It was right here.
- I haven't seen it.

298
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,358
- I aIways put it in the same pIace.
- I'm sure it'II turn up.

299
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,670
(guard) Lights out in ten minutes.

300
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,034
The tattoos - there's a maze.

301
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,918
- Get away from me.
- I need to see 'em.

302
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,230
You gotta show 'em to me.
It's puIIing me in.

303
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,915
I said, get away from me.

304
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,271
OK.

305
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,555
He's got a maze on his skin.

306
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,148
Man's got a maze on his skin.

307
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,358
Why? Why wouId he do that? Why?

308
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,075
Why wouId he put a maze on his skin?

309
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,912
Um...

310
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,991
I don't know.

311
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,309
- How are your contacts in chemicaI Iockup?
- Depends who's asking.

312
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,870
I need a bottIe of drain Iine root controI,
sooner than Iater.

313
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,475
You got weeds growing in your ceII?

314
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,076
Just one.

315
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,674
(man) Looking for me?

316
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,036
I wanted to ask some questions
about the LincoIn Burrows case.

317
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,951
- Yeah?
- I'm Veronica Donovan.

318
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,190
I'm representing LincoIn on his appeaI.

319
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,349
What about it?

320
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,955
You were the first one to LincoIn's
apartment the night of the murder.

321
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,029
Right.

322
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,908
I'd reaIIy appreciate it if you couId
just teII me exactIy what you saw.

323
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,278
Dispatch caIIed. Burrows was seen running
from the garage where they found Steadman.

324
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,079
So we went over to Burrows' pIace.

325
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,233
We spread out, l took the bathroom. l saw
your client washing out the bloody pants.

326
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,197
PoIice! Hands up.

327
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,748
I don't need to teII you
it was Steadman's bIood.

328
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,630
In the report you typed up, you said
you saw LincoIn in the bathroom. That's aII.

329
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,395
Later, you testified that you saw him
washing the pants. Which one is it?

330
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,268
- Does it matter?
- Did you see him washing the pants or not?

331
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,673
Yes. He stood up, turned around,
his hands were aII wet, Iooking guiIty as heII.

332
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,151
Your testimony factored into his conviction.
You know that, right?

333
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,839
You know, Iady, if you got any other
questions, just go through the department.

334
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,270
Ms Donovan?

335
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,794
I didn't mean to scare you.

336
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,350
- What are you doing here?
- Nick Savrinn, with Project Justice.

337
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,273
I know who you are,
but what are you doing here?

338
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,037
Look, my boss may not think
LincoIn's case is worth Iooking into, but I do.

339
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,031
There's a quicker way
to take care of your probIem.

340
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,315
There's smarter ways, too.

341
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,356
(guard) Lights out in ten minutes.
Hey, Iights out in ten minutes.

342
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,189
What stood out was that most death penaIty
cases take ten years to exhaust aII appeaIs.

343
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,271
LincoIn got there in three.

344
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,148
So for it to be expedited, there had
to have been some poIiticaI infIuence?

345
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,028
Steadman was the vice-president's brother.
It's not hard to beIieve.

346
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,953
How? They got to every judge
that rejected his appeaI?

347
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,031
It doesn't take ajudge.

348
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,710
AII it takes is a IittIe speciaI attention
from one of his cIerks.

349
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,110
But how LincoIn got fast-tracked
doesn't interest me. It's why.

350
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,236
If he was set up, then why?

351
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,756
I think the answer to that
might Iie in the victim.

352
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,072
What do we know? He was a CEO of EcoFieId,
right? He was pushing aIternative energy.

353
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,277
Successfully pushing aIternative energy.

354
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,033
OiI companies, the Saudis,
even our government -

355
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,750
a Iot of peopIe stood to benefit
with Steadman out of the picture.

356
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,752
Why did you wait tiII now
to take up this case?

357
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,628
I thought he did it, Iike everybody eIse.

358
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,836
I just hope it's not too Iate.

359
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,310
It very weII may be.
You need to prepare yourseIf for that.

360
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,996
What about you?

361
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,071
Why death penaIty work?

362
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,431
My father did 15 years
for a crime he didn't commit.

363
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,116
I know that when the government gets you in
their cross hairs, you stand very IittIe chance.

364
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,519
That's why.

365
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,038
Now, do you want my heIp?

366
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,069
- I want in.
- Too Iate.

367
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,993
I'II do anything.
These hands are digging machines.

368
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,789
I'II get you to China.
I'II dig Iike a psychotic rodent if I have to.

369
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,711
Fish, I gotta be back in.

370
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,588
As of right now, there is no in.
Van Gogh over there is my new ceII mate.

371
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,830
But you're gonna get rid of him.

372
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,799
- I'II do what's necessary.
- You're my boy.

373
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,356
- So how you gonna do it?
- Let's just put it this way.

374
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,238
Someone's gonna get hurt.

375
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,551
(phone ringing)

376
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,039
(woman) How did we miss this?

377
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,671
ScofieId's father was out of the picture by the
time he was born. Took his mother's name.

378
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,673
AII right. ScofieId had no priors
and a fuII-time job as an engineer?

379
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,320
- (man) Correct.
- Then he goes and robs a bank,

380
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,630
discharging a gun in the process,

381
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,712
so in sentencing he couId
manoeuvre his way to Fox River,

382
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,031
where his brother's
scheduled to die in less than a month.

383
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,998
- Obviously, something's up.
- With aII due respect,

384
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,993
brothers are incarcerated together aII over.
It may just be a coincidence.

385
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,471
(woman) Move on the younger brother.

386
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:03,112
Do it pre-emptiveIy, before anything rises up,
bites any of us in the ass.

387
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,310
It's a pathway.

388
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,149
Where does it Iead?

389
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,952
Where are you taking me?

390
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,998
What? Are you nuts?

391
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,072
Officer! I need an officer!

392
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,231
What the heII's the probIem down here?

393
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,279
What the... Son of a bitch.
Open up on 40.

394
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,238
He's got the pathway on his body.
It Ieads somewhere.

395
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,390
- Back off, Haywire.
- Now, Iook.

396
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,516
Look at his tattoos. It's a pathway.

397
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,750
I said back off.
You want a hot shot?

398
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,637
I'm teIIing you, Iook... Argh!

399
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,631
Back off, man.

400
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,793
- Let's go. Get him out of here.
- It Ieads to heII! It Ieads to heII!

401
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,034
It's a pathway to heII!
He's taking us aII to heII!

402
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,151
(door slides opens)

403
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,797
So, the gang's aII back together again.

404
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,440
WeII, ain't that sweII?

405
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,875
I toId you
not to go around me with the Pope.

406
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,430
But you just keep making waves, don't you?

407
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,190
- Good to be back, man.
- Good to have you back.

408
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,597
So, when do we get started?

409
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,953
- Good afternoon, Mr ScofieId.
- HeIIo.

410
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,031
How are you feeIing today?

411
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,111
ReaI good.

412
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,350
What happened?

413
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,714
Uh...

414
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,792
Caught an eIbow pIaying basketbaII.

415
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,869
Uh-huh.

416
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,713
- Mind if I take a Iook?
- By aII means.

417
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,877
You know you're gonna get kiIIed
in here, right? If you're not carefuI.

418
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,110
I'II make you a bet.

419
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,955
When I get out of here, aIive,
I'II take you to dinner.

420
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,431
Lunch. Cup of coffee.

421
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,354
MichaeI, this charm act

422
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,149
couId be exactIy what's getting you
into troubIe out in the yard.

423
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,671
Lean forward.

424
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,636
AII right. You went to the parking garage,
Terence Steadman is aIready dead.

425
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,917
- That's right.
- You saw that, you ran? Took the gun?

426
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,718
- Dumped the gun.
- Where?

427
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,315
- Storm drain. Van Buren and WeIIs.
- Nobody ever found it.

428
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,593
What did you do after that?
Go back to your apartment?

429
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,556
Yeah.

430
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,196
l was freaking out,
trying to fgure out what had happened.

431
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,352
Then l saw the bloody pants in the tub.

432
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,232
The cops, they busted in
a minute after I got there.

433
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,709
The pants, with Steadman's bIood on them.

434
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,917
First cop on the scene says
he saw you washing them in the tub.

435
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,549
He's Iying. My hands were wet
after spIashing water on my face.

436
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,995
PoIice! Let's see the hands! Hands up!

437
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,714
I never touched those pants.

438
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,314
Which brings us back to the gun,
the one you dumped.

439
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,153
It was pIanted.
OnIy way it couId have got there.

440
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,189
- BaIIistics matched it to a sIug...
- The gun was pIanted. Just Iike the pants.

441
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,192
Your fingerprints were aII over the gun.

442
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,759
Bo.

443
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,514
- Who's Bo?
- He's the guy who arranged everything.

444
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,279
He had me come round the night before,
try a few guns, see which one felt right.

445
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,557
That was the setup. One of those
must have been the murder weapon.

446
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,236
That's how they got my fingerprints
on the gun. Had to be.

447
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:05,429
AII right. So this Bo, he coerces you
into doing this, aII to cIear a $90,000 debt?

448
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,995
He was gonna kiII my son.

449
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,073
- WeII?
- Lot of ''I didn't do it'', don't count for much.

450
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,072
The tape that shows LincoIn
puIIing the trigger. You got it?

451
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,152
- Yeah.
- If LincoIn's teIIing the truth, the tape's Iying.

452
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,677
I think we shouId have a Iook,
decide for ourseIves.

453
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,991
You're cIear.

454
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,358
If the chemicaIs can eat
through the iron pipes,

455
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,874
how come they can't eat
through the tube?

456
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,077
When the chemicaIs are combined,
they become a corrosive.

457
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,311
- You studied chemistry or something?
- Not in schooI.

458
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,839
But what you're doing up there
in the infirmary,

459
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,036
what's it gotta do with this here?

460
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,078
Getting through this waII
is just the beginning.

461
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,199
There's a whoIe Iot of reaI estate
in between here and the outside waIIs.

462
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,831
The infirmary's
the cIosest buiIding to those waIIs.

463
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,553
And the weakest Iink in the security chain.

464
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,631
CooI.

465
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,356
I think I've removed enough grout
to bust through.

466
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,512
I'm gonna need you to make some noise.

467
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,389
# Como una promesa, eres t¨±.
Como una ma¨¾ana...

468
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,119
Is that the best you can do?

469
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,636
Have some faith, papi. Have some faith.

470
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,188
# Como una sonrisa, eres t¨±

471
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,078
- (man) Shut up!
- # Eres t¨±, as¨ª...

472
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,073
- (angry shouts and commotion)
- # Eres t¨±

473
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,675
# Mi esperanza, eres t¨±, eres t¨±

474
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,880
- (klaxon)
- # As¨ª, eres t¨±

475
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,112
# Eres t¨±

476
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:36,196
# Como el agua de mi fuente

477
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,193
(screaming) # Eres t¨±

478
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,594
# Eres t¨±

479
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,117
- # Eres...
- (klaxon)

480
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,636
Not one more word. Next inmate
that opens his mouth goes in the hoIe.

481
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,831
(whispers) We're good.

482
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,431
You OK?

483
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,350
Work.

484
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,829
- It's fine.
- (doorbell)

485
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,791
I got it.

486
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,393
- Everything aII right?
- CouIdn't be better.

487
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,994
You want to come in?
We just sat down to eat.

488
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,073
No. I just wanted to stop by
to teII you in person.

489
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,830
- ProbIem soIved.
- What's this?

490
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,632
That is a transfer request. MichaeI ScofieId
is getting shipped out tomorrow.

491
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,471
Have a good night.

492
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,111
