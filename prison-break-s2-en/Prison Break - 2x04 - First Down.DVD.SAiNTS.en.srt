1
00:00:01,407 --> 00:00:03,238
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,327 --> 00:00:06,160
Those ass-hats are worth more dead
than you and I are alive.

3
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,232
Somebody's gonna get that money.
Might be me.

4
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:12,085
A job like that might go a little smoother
with an extra pair of hands.

5
00:00:13,503 --> 00:00:15,562
I want divers down in the river.

6
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,105
-Are you Scott Kolbrenner?
- You must be Debra Jean.

7
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:19,836
-It's nice to meet you.
-Same here.

8
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:22,426
Apparently, Fibonacci's
coming up for air again.

9
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:26,124
And if he testifies at that hearing,
a lot of people are going down.

10
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:29,339
Caroline, they're taking her in.
Of course. I'll keep an eye on her.

11
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:31,069
Hi, my name is Sara and I'm an addict.

12
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:34,898
-Hi, my name is Lance and I'm an addict.
-Hi, Lance.

13
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:39,123
-You did one hell of a job, doc.
-It's okay for you to leave now.

14
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:41,032
Oh, I'm leaving, you're not.

15
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:45,684
-Where to, sir?
-Utah.

16
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:47,058
-Ready?
-Yeah.

17
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:55,515
-So which one of them was it?
-Might be Scofield.

18
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,676
Probably gonna find
his brother in there too.

19
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,590
Are you meeting up with her?

20
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,613
-Your doctor?
-I don't know.

21
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,817
I knew the little whore
would take us right to them.

22
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:12,135
What happens when you get to Mexico?
Where will you go?

23
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,993
It's best if you don't know.
It's best for everyone.

24
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:21,959
We'll drop you off in the next town,
and I'll wire you that 1 0,000, like I said.

25
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:24,638
Shouldn't take more than a week or two.

26
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,892
Michael, we got company.

27
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:37,199
What the hell's he doing?

28
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,399
-Hold on! Hold on!
-Hold on!

29
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,062
Who is it?

30
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:49,113
Who is it?

31
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:53,734
It's Bellick.

32
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,332
Hold on!

33
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,092
Hold on, hold on.

34
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,085
-Duck! Down!
-Hold on, hold on.

35
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,891
Hold on.

36
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:14,874
Can this thing go any faster?

37
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:18,317
What do you think?

38
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,979
Look out!

39
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,842
Hold on!

40
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:57,219
-Look out! Look out!
-Hold on!

41
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,876
Nobody move!

42
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,859
Nobody move!

43
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,600
Oh, good to see you again, boy.

44
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,278
No need for anyone to get hurt, boss.

45
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:26,133
Boss? Oh, there's no need
for formalities anymore there, Sink.

46
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:29,188
I'm no longer an employee of the state,
thanks to you.

47
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:31,180
I think somebody wants that reward.

48
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,925
Oh, it's not about reward money, friend.

49
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:37,202
Your pal Manche
told me all about your little treasure hunt...

50
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:39,374
...for Westmoreland's stash.

51
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,960
Get in the car.

52
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:43,948
We're going to Utah.

53
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:50,009
Season 2
Episode 4
First Down

54
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,231
Cops following you all over the country...

55
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,753
...when all they had to do
was tail the tail, you know.

56
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:24,338
Move that moneymaker, sweetheart.

57
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,074
Let's move it, convict.

58
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:29,144
If you know about the money in Utah,
why do you need us?

59
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,270
In the excitement of the escape, Manche
didn't hear everything Westmoreland said...

60
00:04:33,278 --> 00:04:35,576
...before he kicked the bucket,
but he heard enough.

61
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:38,979
Utah and five million.
You'll fill in the blanks.

62
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:42,497
-Hey!
-Don't even think about getting cute.

63
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:45,391
You and your brother are gonna take me
to where that money is...

64
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:47,599
...or the whore gets dead real fast.

65
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:49,669
Ask me if I'm bluffing.

66
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:05,087
The dredging of the river beneath
Scofield's apartment bore some fruit.

67
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:07,555
Found a hard drive under the riverbed.

68
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:10,445
Serial numbers match an order
that Scofield put in with Dell...

69
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:12,486
...a few months
before he was incarcerated.

70
00:05:12,574 --> 00:05:15,941
They've recovered about 1 2 percent
of the data so far.

71
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,240
And this is helping us how?

72
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:38,557
Blood tests came back.
B negative all over that crash site.

73
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,616
-Scofield and Burrows are--
-B negative, I know.

74
00:05:41,663 --> 00:05:43,824
-I'll reach out to the media.
-How about don't?

75
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:46,915
If it gets out that the guy...

76
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:50,876
...who masterminded this whole thing
is possibly dead...

77
00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:53,436
...the other six cons are gonna get
their guards up more.

78
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:54,799
It is our policy-- Excuse me.

79
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,938
It is our policy not to announce deaths
until they're confirmed.

80
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,069
We found an exploding car
and a blood match.

81
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,365
-Well, then do more tests.
-On what?

82
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:07,838
On the bumper. I don't know,
I don't care. Just delay.

83
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:11,770
I want those guys out there getting
more complacent, not more careful.

84
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:16,890
But the Iranian government promises
to forge ahead with its nuclear program.

85
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,505
In national news,
the eight escaped convicts...

86
00:06:19,582 --> 00:06:23,575
...from Fox River Penitentiary
in Illinois are still at la--

87
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:24,913
I was listening to that.

88
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,472
-Yeah, I wanna hear this.
-Really? You like John Denver?

89
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,692
Yeah.

90
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:05,531
-Don't quit your day job.
-What?

91
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,706
No, I just need a little tequila
to get my karaoke on.

92
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,170
Yeah.

93
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,403
Hey, yo, slow down.

94
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:21,128
-We're doing, like, 65 in a 60--
-Yo, slow down.

95
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:22,444
All right, Dad.

96
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,638
You know, we can't be having that, man.
Tickets are, like, 200 bones.

97
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:34,333
Yeah.

98
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,981
I never thought I'd say this, Scofield...

99
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,528
...but I thank God
for the day you walked into Fox River.

100
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:44,185
And out of it.

101
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,824
It's gonna be okay.

102
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:51,592
I don't wanna hear from you right now.
You told me nothing would happen.

103
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,374
You promised me.

104
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,590
Oh, that's one pissed off commie
you got on your hands there, Scofield.

105
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:04,424
Didn't your mama tell you how to treat
a lady, or was she a whore like this one?

106
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:06,915
-Linc.
-Got a problem there, Burrows?

107
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:10,035
We only need one of you
to take us to the money.

108
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:11,306
Remember that.

109
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:14,349
Let's go, buddy.

110
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,758
Let's go.

111
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:19,524
I'd been really drunk
at the wedding speech...

112
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,983
...and this was the first time
that we'd spoken since then.

113
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,466
And it was cleansing.
It was really cleansing.

114
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,045
Thank you.

115
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:34,050
Good share, Ralph.

116
00:08:34,142 --> 00:08:37,270
Well, we're out of time,
unless there are any burning desires....

117
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,369
Actually, I'd like to...

118
00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:42,890
-...you know, if there's time.
-Of course.

119
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:46,150
I'm Lance, and I'm an addict.

120
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,707
-Hi, Lance.
-Hi, Lance.

121
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:54,499
My mother died of MS last week.

122
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,102
She just gave out.

123
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:01,798
Just like my grandfather did,
just like my sister did...

124
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:04,146
...just like l....

125
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:07,397
If I may?

126
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:13,421
-MS isn't usually considered genetic.
-Really? What are you, a doctor?

127
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:18,128
I am, actually.

128
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,588
Sorry.

129
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:24,852
Thank you.

130
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,628
All right, everybody, face the wall
and look straight ahead.

131
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:45,387
Eyes front.

132
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,803
-How was your flight?
-Bumpy. Everything's ready?

133
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,197
We got a container ship down
at the navy yard. Captain's one of ours.

134
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,885
He's got a stateroom listed
as a cargo hold on the manifest.

135
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:57,740
You and your family will be on it
when it sets sail tomorrow.

136
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,624
Six days from now, John,
you'll be in Sardinia.

137
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,120
Good work.

138
00:10:09,214 --> 00:10:10,511
Sylvia.

139
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:13,639
Dad.

140
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,578
Yeah.

141
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:18,431
We missed you.

142
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:20,426
Yes.

143
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,824
I missed you too.

144
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:34,639
It's over, it's over.

145
00:11:13,727 --> 00:11:14,819
Come on.

146
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:27,020
Come on, come on.

147
00:11:28,574 --> 00:11:30,769
What the hell are you doing?

148
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:36,532
Mind your own business.

149
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:52,117
What kind of son of a bitch
doesn't have a spare tire in his car?

150
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,716
The kind that already used it.

151
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:57,781
Well, then you're just the sad sack that has
to go back into town and get a new one.

152
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,018
That's like three miles.

153
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:00,533
That's right.

154
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,324
All right, everybody out.

155
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,430
That way. Go on.

156
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,354
-Careful.
-Don't touch me.

157
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:23,677
Just relax.

158
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:27,710
You know, I believed everything
you told me, and I did everything you asked.

159
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,075
I risked my life for you.

160
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,810
For what?
For $10,000 I risked my life?

161
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,569
And this entire time
you've had $5 million just waiting there.

162
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,426
You're a bastard, Michael.

163
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:44,516
For all that aggravation, I hope you get
to hit that a few times, Scofield.

164
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:50,489
We're gonna wait it out in that shack.

165
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:54,582
Just keep moving. Come on.

166
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:57,578
Come on, come on.

167
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,671
Fantasia, get going.

168
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:05,295
I need to talk to you alone.

169
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:09,826
-What do you want?
-To ruin his life like he's ruined mine.

170
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,446
-And what did you see, sir?
-I was overheating, so I pulled in.

171
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:21,777
This car was already here.

172
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,990
-What about you?
-Oh, I was reading. I didn't see nothing.

173
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,851
Hey, buddy!

174
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:28,842
Where you coming from?

175
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:32,623
Me? I was just hitting the head, boss.

176
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:34,128
What's your name?

177
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,009
Clyde.

178
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:41,523
-Clyde May.
-You got any lD, Mr. May?

179
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:46,663
I don't drive anymore,
so I don't really have any lD per se.

180
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:52,606
Camel jockey left a big box of boom-boom
under my jeep back in Kandahar.

181
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:55,541
-You military?
-Was.

182
00:13:55,582 --> 00:13:59,018
-Which one's your vehicle?
-These two sleds right here.

183
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,329
That is, the in-between rides, anyhow.

184
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:05,162
Ain't much of a bag
to be hitchhiking with.

185
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:06,863
I travel light.

186
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:10,000
You're just hoofing it out here,
middle of nowhere?

187
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:13,914
I do have the right to see a little bit
of the country I lost my hand for, don't l?

188
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:15,818
Why don't you tell me
what this is about?

189
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:18,097
We got a vehicle here without a driver.

190
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:21,905
And at present, you're the only driver
without a vehicle.

191
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:26,252
Hell, is that what this is all about?
Why didn't you say so?

192
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:29,337
Dirty hippie kid
dropping a deuce in the facilities.

193
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:32,807
He came in with that car
not two minutes ago.

194
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,388
Check it out.

195
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,598
What were you, Army?

196
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:47,068
Hell, no. Corps.

197
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:51,662
Well, then, semper fi, brother.
What outfit were you?

198
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:54,693
Hundred and ninety-sixth.

199
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:58,591
Hundred and ninety-sixth?

200
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:02,574
Never heard of it. Where they out of?

201
00:15:02,974 --> 00:15:03,963
Hey, sarge.

202
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,549
Hell, man, I didn't do nothing.

203
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:11,893
Found these in his knapsack
after he said he had no car.

204
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:13,460
What?

205
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:19,893
Semper fi, brother.

206
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,284
Semper fi.

207
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:30,836
Stop stressing. It doesn't do any good.

208
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:35,196
Maybe you ought to start stressing
if they're gonna put a bullet in our heads.

209
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,565
They need us.
They need us to get that money.

210
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,183
I admire your optimism.

211
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:44,841
She's rolling, man. I can feel it.

212
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:48,821
So you wanna ruin Scofield's life?
Well, get in line.

213
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,404
What are you really looking for?

214
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:55,946
-Same as you. Money.
-Money? You want money?

215
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,661
Ten grand. How's that sound?

216
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,877
We do it right now,
right there on those floorboards.

217
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:03,886
Not in a thousand years.

218
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:06,946
Beat it, then.
You got nothing else I need.

219
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:10,203
Typical man.
I'm talking about millions of dollars...

220
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:12,866
-...and you'd piss it away for sex.
-That's right.

221
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:16,362
And I was hoping you wouldn't
let Michael outsmart you too.

222
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:18,976
Scofield ain't outsmarting no one.

223
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:21,768
You think that tire went flat by accident?

224
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:26,769
-What are you offering?
-I can find out where the money is.

225
00:16:26,814 --> 00:16:29,009
-He trusts me.
-What do you want?

226
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:30,519
My fair share.

227
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:34,846
You find out where that money is,
your fair share is $200,000.

228
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:38,043
-Out of five million? That's not very--
-I got the gun, girl.

229
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:40,137
You're lucky you're a partner at all.

230
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:45,477
I'll be right back.

231
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,257
Fibonacci's in DC.

232
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:53,826
Yeah, and he's in Denver,
Atlanta, Miami.

233
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:56,480
-I know.
-No, no, no. This time it's for real.

234
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:57,907
He's testifying again.

235
00:16:58,014 --> 00:16:59,641
He's in Washington right now.

236
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:01,936
The Globe Hotel, room 1 1 6.

237
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:05,642
-ls this information any good?
-It's from New Jersey.

238
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:08,413
Fishhead Tommy wants to pay tribute.

239
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:12,607
Get the car.

240
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:21,188
Look at this room, John.

241
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:23,453
Look.

242
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:27,173
We can be a family again.

243
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:31,998
But you wanna risk it all, disrespect us.
And for what, for vengeance?

244
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:34,592
-He betrayed me--
-I don't care.

245
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,677
He betrayed us.

246
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:43,864
I'm sorry, you will never
understand what happens...

247
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,685
...when you're in prison.

248
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:49,807
But you could go back to prison.

249
00:17:49,854 --> 00:17:51,845
I swear to God...

250
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:59,857
...I'd rather die than go back.
There's no going back. Never, ever again.

251
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:04,458
Christ saved you, John.
Don't turn your back on him.

252
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:07,260
Don't turn your back on us.

253
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:17,855
I....

254
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:31,705
I don't know,
about 20 miles from Gunnison.

255
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:33,835
He's coming. I have to go.

256
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:38,730
Who was that?

257
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:40,626
Nobody. It's just my father.

258
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,031
-All right.
-Hey, listen.

259
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:44,838
Do you mind if we stop
at the next motel?

260
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,172
-It's only, like, 4:00.
-Yeah, but we've been driving forever.

261
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:53,054
-That's cool, I'll drive.
-I really just wanna stop.

262
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:54,851
-But if we get on the road now--
-Scott.

263
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:58,672
It's my car,
and I'm tired of being in it, okay?

264
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:01,272
All right.

265
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:06,803
Heard about the call coming in.

266
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:11,107
Can you believe it? Of all the players, it's
the rat that could give us our first collar.

267
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:15,249
If you guys need to use the can, hold it.

268
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:21,238
You need to tinkle, sweet pea,
I'll watch you anytime. Sit down.

269
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:25,305
Hands behind your back.

270
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:39,675
Took your time.

271
00:19:41,694 --> 00:19:43,821
It takes time to gain a man's confidence.

272
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:47,874
You're right, he'll bite on anything I say.

273
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:52,933
You just tell me where we trap him,
and I'll tell him that's where the money is.

274
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:14,129
Hey. You're the guy
from the gas station, right?

275
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:17,277
I'm the guy
who was having car trouble.

276
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:24,480
-Seems to be purring along now, huh?
-Yeah. Water pump.

277
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:27,968
Two hundred bucks for this heap.

278
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,069
They'll get you.

279
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:32,005
Look, I hope I'm not out of line...

280
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:35,222
...but I heard you telling the cop
back there about your hand.

281
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:38,113
My old man was killed in Nam
when I was a kid...

282
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:40,437
...so I have the utmost respect
for our servicemen.

283
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,102
Just serving my country.

284
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:46,232
A lot of us are grateful for it.
Listen, if you need a ride or something....

285
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:52,958
Well, to be honest with you,
my dogs are kind of barking.

286
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,721
Well, all right.

287
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:56,645
Jerry Curtin.

288
00:20:57,054 --> 00:21:01,115
Clyde. Clyde May.

289
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:05,076
My kid Danny is riding shotgun.
I hope you don't mind sitting in the back.

290
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:08,075
Hi. I'm Danielle.

291
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,649
Hi, yourself.

292
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:24,576
-Hey.
-What do you want?

293
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:27,855
-I need to use the bathroom.
-Again?

294
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:29,458
I have a small bladder.

295
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:31,055
That ain't all you got.

296
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:39,026
Get up.

297
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:48,655
Well?

298
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:52,667
They plan to trap you.
The big one, he's got friends in Utah.

299
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,764
Criminals. A town called Panguitch.

300
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:57,535
They grow drugs on a farm there.

301
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,599
They'll tell you that's where the money is,
but no money.

302
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:04,073
Just old friends with guns,
waiting for you.

303
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:09,088
Easy enough.
We take a pass on Panguitch.

304
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:16,158
-Where's the money really?
-I'll find out soon enough.

305
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:19,150
But 200,000 was old price
for this information.

306
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:24,477
-I want a new price.
-She's trying to renegotiate.

307
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:28,607
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be face-down in a marijuana farm.

308
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:31,019
One third.

309
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:36,496
It's gonna take a lot more than information
if you want a million-six, sweet pea.

310
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:39,864
-Such as?
-You know.

311
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:44,270
-Piece of that can, anytime I want it.
-ls that it?

312
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,059
Aren't you gonna slap me?

313
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:48,870
I've slept with men
for a lot less, trust me.

314
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:51,341
What happened
to " Never in a thousand years"?

315
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:54,083
That was negotiating.

316
00:22:58,397 --> 00:22:59,796
So...

317
00:23:01,342 --> 00:23:02,900
...deal?

318
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:06,508
Deal.

319
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:16,149
We got 150,000 here, John.

320
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:20,317
With Vittorio's place in Solanos,
we'll be able to live off the interest.

321
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:22,909
Where's your father?

322
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:32,561
Everything all right, boss?

323
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,606
Yeah. Let's get this over with...

324
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:40,689
...so I can get back to my family.

325
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:42,909
She'll get it done.

326
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,836
Nika and I have come too far together.

327
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,758
-When money's on the line, trust no one.
-Sometimes you have to.

328
00:23:47,805 --> 00:23:50,000
Not if you wanna survive, you don't.

329
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:53,289
You really don't trust anyone, do you?

330
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:56,361
Can you blame me
after all that's happened?

331
00:23:57,085 --> 00:24:00,452
No, I mean before that. Before prison.

332
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:02,342
Every time I trusted someone
I got burned.

333
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,627
Every time I got close to someone,
I got screwed.

334
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:10,843
I know better and so should you.

335
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,468
That's right, the Lotus Motel.

336
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:17,250
I don't know the number.
I can't talk anymore, I have to go.

337
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:31,293
Well, check it, I know this might
be a little forward and all, but....

338
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:33,386
Let me ask you something.

339
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,202
You got a man?

340
00:24:36,093 --> 00:24:37,651
I mean, a boyfriend?

341
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:41,318
-No, what am I thinking? You're Mormon--
-I'm not Mormon.

342
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,861
You think all girls from Utah
are Mormons?

343
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:48,905
They are, aren't they?

344
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:55,039
Well, yo.
Hey, then you can party, right? Hey.

345
00:24:55,838 --> 00:24:58,739
When I land, I want 12 armed agents
waiting for me on the ground.

346
00:24:58,781 --> 00:25:01,079
Tell them I wanna go
to the motel from the airstrip.

347
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:02,377
You got it.

348
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,853
I was an ass before. I apologize.

349
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:10,901
A little bit.

350
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,491
Sorry. Here you go.

351
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:16,399
I was a huge ass. I apologize.

352
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:18,812
I'm not gonna argue with you.

353
00:25:18,878 --> 00:25:23,144
Well, what are the odds
that you're actually a doctor?

354
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:27,408
Fair enough.
They're probably not good, but....

355
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,341
And I should not have interrupted you,
and I'm sorry.

356
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:36,435
-I'm sorry too.
-Well, then, apologies accepted.

357
00:25:36,477 --> 00:25:40,038
I recommend the blueberry pie.

358
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:42,097
Blueberry pie it is.

359
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,526
-Hey there, Danny.
-Hey.

360
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:06,515
Sure was nice of your daddy
to buy me a room for the night.

361
00:26:06,526 --> 00:26:08,721
Yeah, he's always helping out
with vets and stuff.

362
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:09,992
Yeah.

363
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:12,512
Good man.

364
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:17,155
But I was wishing we could've
kept going on toward Utah.

365
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,817
Lots of light left in the day,
lots of road to go.

366
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,345
When Dad's back acts up we stop.

367
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:28,022
"Young Miss "?

368
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,685
That's kind of insulting, isn't it?

369
00:26:31,261 --> 00:26:32,785
I mean, you're a grown woman.

370
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:40,029
But adults are always trying
to infantilize girls your age.

371
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:41,929
Treat you like children.

372
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:45,533
No duh. My dad
won't let me get earrings, and I'm 1 4.

373
00:26:45,565 --> 00:26:47,260
You see, that's what I'm saying.

374
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:51,453
You are more than perfectly capable
of making your own decisions.

375
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:54,820
-Tell my dad that.
-Yeah, but he don't wanna hear it, right?

376
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:59,612
Because he wants to keep you as a baby.

377
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:07,677
Right? Even though you're more
than old enough to choose...

378
00:27:07,677 --> 00:27:09,975
...how you wanna dress...

379
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,037
...or accessorize.

380
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,335
-What are you doing?
-ln need of a friend--

381
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:18,754
-No, no. I'm telling my dad.
-You know, I'm not good at kid--

382
00:27:18,782 --> 00:27:20,306
Wait!

383
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:28,522
She's got it all wrong.

384
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:31,330
Wait outside.

385
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,726
You and I are gonna work this out.

386
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:48,210
Jerry, you really don't want to do this.

387
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:55,549
The thing I like about you
is your determination.

388
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,347
I have a family in Kladno
that have been waiting for me...

389
00:27:58,397 --> 00:28:00,365
...to send for them.

390
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,879
They know what kind of work you're in?

391
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:07,352
They think I work at Starbucks.

392
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,029
How stupid do you think I am?

393
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:27,903
My daddy always said,
"Fool me once, shame on you...

394
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:31,298
...fool me twice,
and I put you in the ground."

395
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:34,607
Any more games
and I stop the whore's air, understand?

396
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,718
Thanks for the dance, sweet pea.

397
00:28:48,733 --> 00:28:49,961
You bitch.

398
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:52,504
Fooled you.

399
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:03,172
I carried it. The cons can change it.

400
00:29:03,613 --> 00:29:06,582
Oh, you really suck, Bellick,
you know that?

401
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,851
Roll him. Let's go.

402
00:29:12,893 --> 00:29:14,861
Hands behind your back.

403
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:20,457
Thank you.

404
00:29:20,573 --> 00:29:23,235
You're as stupid as the prison doc,
you know that?

405
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:24,726
-lgnore him.
-He conned her too.

406
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,888
Made her think he loved her.
Look what she got.

407
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,965
An overdose
and a shot at 30 years inside.

408
00:29:32,797 --> 00:29:34,492
What are you talking about?

409
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:37,285
You haven't been reading
the papers, have you, college boy?

410
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:42,335
Cops found your girlfriend fish-belly white,
gargling her own puke.

411
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:45,083
-Shut up.
-What do you care?

412
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:47,617
-As long as she left the door open for you.
-Shut up!

413
00:29:48,093 --> 00:29:49,560
Hit a sore spot, didn't l?

414
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:04,757
Dad?

415
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:20,287
It really is, like, the best pie I ever had.

416
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:22,878
Do you know what it needs, though?

417
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:24,497
Some crack.

418
00:30:25,597 --> 00:30:28,122
No, I mean, you know, not a lot.
A pinch.

419
00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:29,781
-A pinch of crack?
-A pinch of crack.

420
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:32,365
A pinch of crack, a dollop of smack.

421
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:36,231
-That's good pie.
-That's so wrong.

422
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:37,806
No?

423
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:41,301
Okay.

424
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:49,080
-Hello?
-Sara. It's me.

425
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:51,465
What do you want?

426
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:53,611
I don't have time to talk.

427
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:57,321
There's every chance
they're listening to this call right now.

428
00:30:57,373 --> 00:30:59,898
But there's a lot I want to say.

429
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:01,557
Please don't hang up on me.

430
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:05,324
-I don't wanna talk to you.
-I heard about--

431
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:08,952
I heard about what happened.

432
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:14,295
I want you to know--

433
00:31:14,365 --> 00:31:19,133
I want you to know how sorry I am.
For everything.

434
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:22,660
Sorry's not gonna do me a whole lot
of good with what I'm up against right now.

435
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:24,050
Listen.

436
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:29,917
Anyone with any ties
to me and my brother is in danger now.

437
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:32,977
I have no ties to you
and your brother anymore.

438
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:35,909
There is a way I can protect you.

439
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:39,084
It's already in your possession.

440
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:45,297
-What are you talking about?
-lt was real, Sara, you and me.

441
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:47,150
It's real.

442
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,377
Michael?

443
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:56,979
Michael?

444
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:07,394
-How long to the motel?
-Approximately 1 0 minutes, sir.

445
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:09,286
Let's make it five.

446
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:19,399
Yo, I haven't taken a shower
like that in forever.

447
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:22,104
Where are you going?

448
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:24,833
-I was gonna surprise you.
-Surprise me how?

449
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:27,046
I was gonna get some tequila and limes.

450
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:31,229
-All right, well, hold up. I'll--
-No, no, no. It'll only take a minute.

451
00:32:31,229 --> 00:32:33,288
Stay here and relax.

452
00:32:33,373 --> 00:32:35,034
You seem kind of nervous.

453
00:32:35,132 --> 00:32:38,363
-I do?
-Yeah, you're sweating.

454
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:40,550
Well, maybe I am nervous.

455
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:43,571
Trust me, girl, you got nothing
to worry about, all right?

456
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:47,982
-I'm one of the good guys.
-You seem like it.

457
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:25,097
Hang on tight.

458
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:28,080
-I had the manager unlock the door.
-Got it.

459
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:08,979
If you're looking for the rat, John...

460
00:34:09,853 --> 00:34:12,583
...Fibonacci's 2000 miles from here.

461
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:17,496
Who are you?

462
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:20,654
Local cops or feds?

463
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:24,031
Feds, John. Only roll out the best
for a man of your stature.

464
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:30,544
I deserve to know who turned on me.

465
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:35,608
-Tommy?
-The man was facing a RlCO rap.

466
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:38,219
He did not want to go to prison.

467
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,051
I'm sure you can appreciate that...

468
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:42,625
...knowing what you know
about the place now.

469
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:48,122
Whatever you're thinking
about doing, John, don't.

470
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:55,506
You are going back to Fox River today,
or the morgue.

471
00:34:55,548 --> 00:34:56,981
That's your call.

472
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:04,794
I'm coming out.

473
00:35:04,892 --> 00:35:07,190
Weapons come out first, John.

474
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:09,810
Forgive me.

475
00:35:13,692 --> 00:35:17,184
Yeah, I'm coming out.

476
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:23,478
Easy, John. Easy.

477
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:27,407
-He's got a weapon. Right hand.
-These are serious men here.

478
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:30,733
They have instructions to shoot
at the first sign of aggression.

479
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:33,375
Please, I'm asking you respectfully.

480
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:38,414
Drop the weapon, kneel,
and put your hands on your head.

481
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:43,032
I kneel only to God.

482
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:46,606
I don't see him here.

483
00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:54,436
No!

484
00:36:20,476 --> 00:36:22,137
I think I screwed up.

485
00:36:22,237 --> 00:36:25,934
My dad's an Air Force colonel. Total Nazi.

486
00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:29,179
One of those nightmare,
overprotective dads.

487
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:32,232
-Yeah?
-Well, I called him.

488
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:36,680
Told him I was traveling with you.

489
00:36:36,765 --> 00:36:40,360
Told him that we were staying
in the same hotel room.

490
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:44,705
-Girl.
-What?

491
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:47,199
You gotta learn how to lie.
What were you thinking?

492
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,923
I don't know-- Yeah, for some reason
I don't know how.

493
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:55,044
He was mad enough when I told him
I was staying in a hotel room with a guy.

494
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:56,627
-That was one thing.
-Yeah, yeah.

495
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:58,724
When I told him I was staying
in a hotel...

496
00:36:58,813 --> 00:37:05,275
...with a guy that I maybe
sort of liked, he lost it.

497
00:37:08,157 --> 00:37:11,149
Wait. Wait, what?

498
00:37:11,197 --> 00:37:13,131
Is that okay?

499
00:37:26,716 --> 00:37:29,241
At least let us take you into town.

500
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:34,652
No. If I'm seen with you
it's a lot of trouble for me.

501
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,517
I can walk. It's only a mile.

502
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:39,039
We never would've made it
this far without you.

503
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:43,252
But now you're crossing the border
without me.

504
00:37:43,548 --> 00:37:45,311
You can't go where we're going.

505
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,406
It's not a life for you.

506
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:53,224
Then that's it, then.

507
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,451
It's over for good.

508
00:37:57,117 --> 00:37:58,106
Thank you.

509
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,106
Be safe.

510
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:09,775
Good luck.

511
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:18,977
I loved you, Michael.

512
00:38:19,357 --> 00:38:22,417
And I thought I was gonna get that back,
but you just used me.

513
00:38:22,748 --> 00:38:25,512
-That's not true.
-I deserve more than this.

514
00:38:25,884 --> 00:38:29,342
I deserve more than just being the girl
that you call when you need something.

515
00:38:29,628 --> 00:38:31,755
You think you're gonna
find the money in Utah?

516
00:38:31,837 --> 00:38:34,328
I don't care about the money in Utah.

517
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:37,698
I don't want any more crime.

518
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:42,659
I turn you in, I get $200,000.
Legal money.

519
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:49,790
You're the policeman's problem now.

520
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:53,217
-Nika.
-Don't come any closer or I'll shoot you.

521
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:55,231
No, you won't.

522
00:39:23,773 --> 00:39:25,502
Good luck to you.

523
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:51,866
-Hey.
-Hey.

524
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:55,770
HQ called. They're asking
why you didn't intercept Abruzzi...

525
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,602
...when he was walking
towards the motel.

526
00:39:58,268 --> 00:40:01,601
The man was a mob boss.
The right move was to get him trapped.

527
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:04,927
They're saying the way you played it,
there was only one possible outcome.

528
00:40:04,957 --> 00:40:09,587
HQ has a problem with the way I do it, they
can pick a gun and follow me next time.

529
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:19,363
Scofield always knew
the rat was the key to Abruzzi.

530
00:40:19,388 --> 00:40:22,585
We just put it out on the wire
and Abruzzi bit.

531
00:40:31,036 --> 00:40:32,435
Speaking of Scofield...

532
00:40:33,149 --> 00:40:35,310
...the crash was staged.

533
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:43,417
Pig blood.

534
00:40:45,148 --> 00:40:46,979
Smart kid.

535
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:56,316
The problem with being that clever,
is that sooner or later...

536
00:40:56,316 --> 00:40:58,580
...you end up getting too clever
for your own good.

537
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,195
Good night.

538
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,469
You have no idea what you're in for.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
