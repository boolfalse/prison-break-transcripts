1
00:00:01,215 --> 00:00:02,876
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:05,466
-I got nothing against you, kid.
-What are you doing?

3
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:06,763
But they do.

4
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:12,949
Your pal Manche told me
all about your Iittle treasure hunt...

5
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,653
...for Westmoreland's stash.
We're going to Utah.

6
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:20,784
-Fooled you.
-Put your hands behind your back.

7
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,495
-Make yourself at home.
-Sure.

8
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:30,726
Your father got a call from the White House.
They withdrew his nomination.

9
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:32,612
According to them,
his confirmation was a problem.

10
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,360
My father's not a suicidal man.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,559
Governor Tancredi, not part of our plan.

12
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,897
Anyone who knows anything
has to be dealt with.

13
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:43,108
If someone is a liability, they go.
Tancredi was a liability.

14
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:45,662
-So is his daughter.
-Wait, what?

15
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,702
Burrows is scheduled to be released...

16
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:53,329
...from the Clifton detention center
in Kingman, Arizona tomorrow morning.

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,897
L.J. ' s out there. I ' m gonna get him.

18
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,389
Take care.

19
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:05,947
Charles Westmoreland, God bless you
and your wrinkled old sack.

20
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:08,846
-It's all here.
-Where's Sucre?

21
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:11,695
Drop the pack. No one's going anywhere.

22
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,431
What the hell are you doing, man?

23
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:28,272
-Sucre, whatever it is you want--
-I want the money.

24
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:31,735
-AII of it.
-What? Are you robbing us?

25
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:35,153
The money was never yours to begin with.
This is about business.

26
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,268
Five million dollars worth of business.

27
00:01:37,737 --> 00:01:39,466
So this is how it's gonna go down, huh?

28
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:42,007
After everything?

29
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:46,042
Once a thief, always a thief.

30
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:47,661
You just figuring that out?

31
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:50,503
The backpack.

32
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,915
Now!

33
00:01:56,964 --> 00:01:58,431
Don't do this, buddy.

34
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,086
Yo, take a Iook around you, papi.

35
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:04,096
There's three of us. There's one of you.

36
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:06,686
You are outnumbered, man,
and we will come after you.

37
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:10,263
-It'II be the Iast thing you do.
-What, are you gonna shoot all of us?

38
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,571
Probably not.

39
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,611
But I will get two.

40
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:20,513
Now, which two is it gonna be?

41
00:02:23,494 --> 00:02:26,930
That's what I thought. Adios, amigos.

42
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:35,975
I don't believe this.

43
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,713
We have come all this way
and done all of this work, man.

44
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:43,390
Thought you was compadres, Tattoo?

45
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,789
So Iook,
what are we gonna do now, man?

46
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,685
Police are gonna be here any second.

47
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,736
Ain't no way I'm Ietting
that dunderpate ride off with 5--!

48
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:56,026
It's your choice.

49
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,766
It's all right.

50
00:03:10,753 --> 00:03:13,017
AII right, I'm gonna give you this...

51
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,373
...and you should be able
to cut yourself free in about an hour.

52
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:22,930
-Yo, so, what's the plan?
-Well, you can do what you want.

53
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,567
I Iet that psychopath T-Bag Ioose once.

54
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:27,359
I'm not gonna do it again.

55
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,807
Make a nice Iittle present for the police
when they get here.

56
00:03:36,413 --> 00:03:37,710
Where is he?

57
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:47,767
I don't know, man. Look, I gotta--
I gotta go, all right?

58
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,592
Good Iuck.

59
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:02,914
They're gonna get you.

60
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:22,450
Ms. Tancredi.
Oh, I didn't mean to startle you.

61
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:25,277
-What are you doing in my house?
-No need to be frightened.

62
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:27,817
I used to work with your father.

63
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:31,028
I'm so sorry for your Ioss.

64
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:41,838
My father didn't commit suicide.

65
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,001
-What are you doing?
-Making sure it doesn't Iook Iike I did.

66
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:52,061
People ask questions
if the day the governor kills himself...

67
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:54,781
...his daughter is found dead
in what Iooks Iike a struggle.

68
00:04:57,274 --> 00:04:58,741
Well, then...

69
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:02,064
...what if they don't find her?

70
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,156
In an apparent attempt
to avoid jail time...

71
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:09,250
...the governor's daughter skips bail
and disappears.

72
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:11,783
We're talking about your Iast minutes,
Ms. Tancredi.

73
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:15,157
-PIease don't do this.
-That stuff on the table is premium.

74
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:16,442
Grade A.

75
00:05:16,803 --> 00:05:18,828
Do yourself a favor: go out on a high.

76
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:20,508
Look, Iook, I'm begging you here.

77
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,302
One Iast ride.

78
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:25,366
God!

79
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,826
"Adios, amigos," huh?

80
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:33,177
What? Too much?

81
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:35,310
You were great.

82
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:43,871
-This thing is freaking heavy, dude.
-It won't be after we split it up.

83
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:46,354
Three ways: me, you and Linc.

84
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:49,791
Four.
We gotta send a share to Charles' daughter.

85
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,879
With her father's Iove,
just Iike I promised.

86
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:54,031
What about C-Note?

87
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:57,593
-Feel bad about the whole thing.
-No way to know if we could trust him.

88
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:58,705
Once we get to Panama,
we'II send something to his family.

89
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,133
Make sure he's taken care of.

90
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:04,737
Five million dollars.

91
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:07,803
I can't believe I'm gonna--

92
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:12,176
Where the hell's the money?

93
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,261
Where the hell is the money?

94
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,062
The backpack.

95
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:47,250
Now!

96
00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:16,082
Season 2
Episode 8
Dead Fall

97
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,361
Here you go. Watch your head.

98
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:59,417
Mr. Burrows,
merry Christmas from the state.

99
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:04,381
Here's a Iist of options available to you.
PIaces to stay...

100
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,020
...businesses that are more open to hiring
men out of the correctional system.

101
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:23,898
Any questions you might have
about your immediate future?

102
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,315
No.

103
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,165
Well, the number on there is toll-free.

104
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:35,244
If you encounter any problems,
you can call that 24/7.

105
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:38,275
-Thanks.
-Wait a second, Iisten. You know what?

106
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,201
Why don't you tell me
where you need to go...

107
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,667
...and I'II make sure you get there.

108
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:48,869
-You know what? I think I'II be all right.
-You sure?

109
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,497
Yeah, thank you.

110
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:02,694
Kid didn't bite.

111
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,622
-He's on foot.
-All right.

112
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,791
Have your men follow him.
Remember, it's the father we want.

113
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,388
We can't go back.

114
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:14,644
You said it:
without the money, we're screwed.

115
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:16,477
-We can't--
-Just Iet me think.

116
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,683
-Maybe there's--
-Just Iet me think.

117
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,684
Maybe it's still back at the house.

118
00:10:20,444 --> 00:10:23,709
The money's not back at the house
unless T-Bag is.

119
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:27,187
He must've switched the packs.

120
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:31,407
What--? What do we do--?
What do we do now?

121
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,088
We still got the 5 grand we took
when we pocketed the money.

122
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:36,814
It's not gonna be 5 million...

123
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,566
...but it might be enough to get us
where we're going.

124
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:44,055
All units be advised,
escaped convicts from Fox River...

125
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,575
...have been positively ID'd
at 1 1 3 1 Monterey Lane.

126
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:49,816
We have dogs being dispatched
to the location.

127
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:52,093
I want every road in or out
of town blocked off.

128
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:56,084
I don't care if it's on wheels, rails
or hooves. I want it stopped and searched.

129
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,293
You said we would have a head start.

130
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:03,283
It was the gunshot, buddy.
One of the neighbors must've heard.

131
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,790
-How fast can that thing go?
-I don't know.

132
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:08,327
Both of us, it could probably,
I don't know--

133
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:14,260
We're never gonna get out of here
on the roads.

134
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:16,969
We need to find another way.

135
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,899
He's in your office.

136
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:28,758
Can't believe they're calling me back.
My escapees are out there.

137
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:32,091
-I wanna know who this guy is.
-Said his name was Sullins.

138
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:34,945
Son of a bitch.

139
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,832
Let me know
if anything breaks on the convicts.

140
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:45,811
-AIex, thanks for coming in.
-Wanna tell me why Internal Affairs...

141
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:48,456
...is pulling me out
in the middle of a manhunt?

142
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:50,811
It's been a while
since we've had a sit-down, hasn't it?

143
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,342
-Not since Shales escape, right?
-Yeah. What's going on, Richard?

144
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:58,141
Well, that's precisely what I'm here
to find out.

145
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:03,101
You're not getting out of here until I do.

146
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:14,068
Oh, my God, civilization.

147
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:24,887
Jenny, how about another round
over here?

148
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,275
What can I get for you, boys?

149
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:32,169
You tell me.

150
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,627
Two waters, then.

151
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,828
And the use of your phone,
if you'd be so kind.

152
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:39,290
Don't worry, it's a Iocal call.

153
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,406
First thing I do we get home?

154
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,081
-CIean underwear.
-Then what?

155
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:50,715
Guess I'II go back to that Iiquor store
and beg for my job back.

156
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:57,979
We had it. We were so close.

157
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,169
I can still taste that money
right there in the back of my throat.

158
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:05,936
Well, nothing that a couple of Keystones,
a Hungry-Man Salisbury steak dinner...

159
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:09,151
...and a night in front of the TV
won't take care of.

160
00:13:11,363 --> 00:13:14,628
Hey, Ma. It's Brad.

161
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,507
Hey, Iisten, me and Roy,
we ran into some car trouble...

162
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:21,055
...and we're wondering
if you can pick us up.

163
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,293
Well, I don't know.

164
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:24,976
What the hell town is this?

165
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:28,906
-Thought you said this was a Iocal call.
-Hey, Bradley, check this out.

166
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:30,392
Just a minute, Ma.

167
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:34,306
These individuals were reportedly
the prisoners who escaped...

168
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,503
...from the Fox River Penitentiary in Illinois
just a couple of days ago.

169
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:40,853
What were they doing all the way out here
in Tooele, Utah?

170
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:45,365
Well, Jeanette Owens, whose garage
they dug up, has her own theory.

171
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:48,992
They pretended that they were
some kind of workers...

172
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:53,215
...from the power company
and that they had made a mistake...

173
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,407
... that they would
have to do some digging.

174
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:57,733
Investigators just....

175
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:01,508
Hey, Ma, on second thought,
can you wire us some extra scratch?

176
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:02,995
Turns out we're not done yet.

177
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,394
Hello.

178
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,417
-Bruce, I need your help.
-Sara?

179
00:14:22,637 --> 00:14:24,696
Bruce, my father didn't commit suicide,
okay?

180
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:29,033
-Okay, just calm down. Where are you?
-He was looking into the Burrows case.

181
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,254
He found something
that they didn't want him to know.

182
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:33,702
Now I think that they think
that I know it too.

183
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:36,902
I want you to Iisten to me.
I'm gonna send someone to pick you up.

184
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,767
I'II bring you back here,
we'II sort all of this out, I promise.

185
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:42,245
Just tell me where you are.

186
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:43,517
I don't know. I'm at a payphone.

187
00:14:45,598 --> 00:14:48,499
-Third and Harper.
-You have your cell if I need to reach you?

188
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,935
I do, but I thought it would be tapped.

189
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:53,159
-I don't know.
-Someone's on their way.

190
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:54,908
Just stay right where you are.

191
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,419
Thank you.

192
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:11,886
-I'II give you 80 bucks for them.
-Come on, man, they're worth--

193
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,261
Worth a Iot more to the person
they actually belong to.

194
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:15,720
These are Iadies clubs, doctor.

195
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:19,522
I'm guessing they're hotter
than a monkey's jockstrap.

196
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:21,002
Eighty bucks.

197
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,595
Throw in the cooler and you got a deal.

198
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:35,469
-We gotta Iose the bike.
-No way.

199
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:37,879
Roads are sealed.
It's the only way we'II make it out.

200
00:15:37,863 --> 00:15:39,125
I can't. I promised Petey--

201
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:41,996
We're not getting that thing
across the river...

202
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,978
...and every minute we spend trying
is a minute we don't have, okay?

203
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:48,541
I'm sorry, but we gotta move.

204
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:02,554
I heard about these kind of places.
They got Ieeches, you know?

205
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:06,477
I'II take the Ieeches in here
over the handcuffs back there.

206
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:07,982
I don't know, papi.

207
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:10,215
It depends where the Ieech Ieeches,
you know--?

208
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:11,140
Stop kidding around.

209
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,773
-You all right, buddy?
-I can't-- I can't move.

210
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:31,648
You feel Iike you broke anything?

211
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:33,060
No, I don't think so.

212
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:35,061
Can you get it--?
Can you get it off of me?

213
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:36,505
I'II try.

214
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:45,107
This thing's not going anywhere.

215
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:47,307
I'm gonna check your foot.

216
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:06,609
I'm sorry, buddy. It's stuck.

217
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,345
-I need you to call 91 1.
-Okay.

218
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:50,400
Take a deep breath for me.

219
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:56,136
Okay, Kelli, my name is Sara.
I'm a doctor. You're gonna be okay.

220
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:58,357
Can you hear me?
You're gonna be all right.

221
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:02,267
I just need you to take some deep breaths
and I need you to hang in there for me.

222
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:04,945
Okay-- Kelli?

223
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:06,460
Kelli?

224
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,518
It's gonna be okay, right?

225
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:21,363
I mean, if you can get eight people
out of prison...

226
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:24,290
...you can get my Puerto Rican ass
out of this, right?

227
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:27,241
Can't you?

228
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:41,640
Damn it!

229
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,946
Did you hear that?

230
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:58,243
I know that sound.

231
00:18:58,406 --> 00:19:00,738
There's a dam upriver.

232
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:04,035
It's a signal.

233
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:07,035
It means they're opening the Iocks.

234
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:09,128
That means the water Ievel's gonna rise.

235
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,500
When it does,
the Iog will just float right off.

236
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:13,121
Yeah?

237
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:16,550
K-23, canine units
at the scene have multiple scents...

238
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:18,644
...and are spreading out into the field.

239
00:19:18,377 --> 00:19:20,470
These guys can't have gotten far.

240
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,525
There were six cons back at that house.

241
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,613
They'II be tracking us in every direction.

242
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:31,198
It'II take them hours to make it over this far
and by that time, the water Ievel will rise.

243
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:33,346
-And we'II be Iong gone.
-Are you sure?

244
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:37,498
Yeah, I'm sure.

245
00:19:39,297 --> 00:19:41,026
I'm sure.

246
00:19:42,092 --> 00:19:43,559
Ask any of the 20 cops there.

247
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:46,337
John Abruzzi was armed.
John Abruzzi drew his weapon.

248
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:48,740
He never should have been allowed
to get that far.

249
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,267
Let's be clear. If you knew how things
needed to be handled on a manhunt...

250
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:56,069
...you'd be out there running one
instead of hamstringing the men that are.

251
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:59,088
The FBI's primary objective
in investigating fugitive matters...

252
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:03,449
...is to effect the swift Iocation
and capture of the fugitives.

253
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:05,902
You have two dead bodies, AIex.

254
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:07,761
I've got two dead felons, Richard.

255
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:11,032
Maybe that doesn't play well
from a public-relations standpoint...

256
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:14,748
...but from a public-safety standpoint,
Abruzzi and Apolskis were by the book.

257
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,239
The shooting of an unarmed kid
at point-blank range is by the book?

258
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:21,054
Come on.

259
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:24,800
Incident report,
David "Tweener" Apolskis.

260
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:27,009
You know, I'm curious.

261
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:29,248
-Was he cuffed during transport?
-Yeah.

262
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,621
It says in here he somehow managed
to grab your primary weapon.

263
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:35,106
-You carry that in a shoulder holster?
-Hip.

264
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:37,866
-Left, right? Right, Ieft?
-Left.

265
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,196
Left.

266
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:43,804
I'm sorry. I get confused sometimes.

267
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:46,748
So just so I've got this right...

268
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:50,613
...you were driving along alone
with a cuffed prisoner...

269
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,163
...and somehow he reaches forward
across your chest...

270
00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:55,061
...grabs your weapon.

271
00:20:57,032 --> 00:20:59,796
It's too bad you didn't
react that quickly with Apolskis.

272
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:03,329
Maybe he'd still be alive.

273
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:47,977
What does origami
have to do with any of this?

274
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:50,443
Michael Scofield sent it to her.

275
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:52,546
And since your brilliant plan
to eliminate...

276
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:55,077
...Sara Tancredi from the equation
failed completely--

277
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,433
-I wouldn't say it failed completely.
-There's a dead woman in a phone booth.

278
00:22:01,092 --> 00:22:02,320
A civilian.

279
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:06,489
A certain number of bodies you can sweep
under the rug.

280
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:09,342
The president's rug is getting so full
you can barely stand on it.

281
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:12,157
So, what do you suggest we should do?

282
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:16,466
-Ever go fishing, Bill?
-Just make your point.

283
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:18,543
There's two ways to catch a fish.

284
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:21,675
You cast out a big net
and hope you get what you're Iooking for.

285
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,533
Or you choose the right bait
and guarantee that you do.

286
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:28,010
It's a simple strategy,
it plays across the board.

287
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:31,248
L.J. will Iead us to Burrows.
Sara will Iead us to Scofield.

288
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,770
How do you intend to follow Sara when
the only Iead you've got is an origami bird...

289
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:38,117
...with an out-of-service phone number?

290
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:41,233
Maybe it's not a phone number.

291
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,505
-What do you have?
-Junior's on the move...

292
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:01,050
...and still no sign of Burrows.

293
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:04,242
Sir, the guy's in hiding.
Maybe he doesn't even know his kid's out.

294
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:07,343
The cop that was held hostage in Utah
has Burrows splitting off...

295
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:11,573
...from the rest of the group just after word
of L.J.'s release hit the wires.

296
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:13,581
He knows.

297
00:23:13,235 --> 00:23:15,703
Now, if we wanna know for sure
if he's there...

298
00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:18,621
...we need to do something
to draw him out.

299
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,890
Hey, yo, man, spare some change?

300
00:23:38,062 --> 00:23:40,155
-No.
-Come on, man.

301
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,668
-No, I'm all tapped out.
-I know you got something.

302
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,498
-I'II take whatever you got.
-Seriously.

303
00:23:44,678 --> 00:23:46,669
I just got out of Iockup.
I would if I could.

304
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:55,762
-Sorry.
-So you think you're better than me, huh?

305
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:59,677
-I don't think I'm better than you.
-Yo, where you running, Iittle man?

306
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:01,869
I'm not running anywhere.

307
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:14,834
This isn't how it's supposed to go.

308
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:19,589
The reason I went along with the break was
to have a Iife with Maricruz and my baby.

309
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:24,712
And now what? Get some two-bit job?

310
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,704
AIways be Iooking over my shoulder?

311
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:31,123
What kind of Iife is that?

312
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:35,609
You can come with me and Linc to Panama.
Start over.

313
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:37,117
The Ionger you stay here...

314
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:40,346
...the more the chance there is
you'II never make it to Panama.

315
00:24:40,158 --> 00:24:41,819
You got other people to think about.

316
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:44,185
Your brother. Your nephew.

317
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:46,246
Sara.

318
00:24:46,926 --> 00:24:49,895
-She's meeting you down there, isn't she?
-I don't know.

319
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:51,843
We never talked about it.

320
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:54,463
-But you're hoping.
-Give it a rest, will you?

321
00:24:54,716 --> 00:24:56,616
Dogs locked in.
We got two trails merging.

322
00:24:56,437 --> 00:24:58,496
They were here,
headed towards Drucker Ranch.

323
00:24:58,703 --> 00:25:00,864
They've gone off-road.
Any additional units...

324
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:03,981
...we need to set up a one-mile perimeter
and then start closing in.

325
00:25:03,923 --> 00:25:05,356
It's getting deeper.

326
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:09,021
Yeah, a Iittle.

327
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:12,799
So how come this freaking tree
ain't moving yet?

328
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:17,172
Let me check.

329
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:27,723
You all right?

330
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,562
Look, Michael...

331
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:34,282
...I understand
if you have to keep going, you know?

332
00:25:34,345 --> 00:25:36,074
Just shut up. I'm not going anywhere.

333
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,629
-No, Iook, just think about it.
-If I Ieave, you drown.

334
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:40,090
I know, but just--

335
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:42,158
The water Ievel's getting higher, Sucre.

336
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:44,716
How many seconds can you hold
your breath? Forty-five?

337
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,711
Sixty? That's how Iong you've got to Iive
if I take off.

338
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,136
How Iong you have if you stay?
Till the dogs Iead the cops here?

339
00:25:51,418 --> 00:25:55,411
-What you're suggesting is not an option.
-I ain't trying to be a hero or nothing.

340
00:25:55,393 --> 00:25:58,829
We both know there are only two things
that can happen now.

341
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:01,946
Leave me here...

342
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:04,017
...or we both get caught.

343
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:28,806
-Bruce?
-Sara.

344
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,345
I know we said not to use this number,
but I needed to know you were okay.

345
00:26:32,332 --> 00:26:35,267
My driver went to pick you up
and the place was a crime scene.

346
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,351
The woman that he saw
by the payphone...

347
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,115
...that was supposed to be me.

348
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:41,738
And I had to leave her there.
I didn 't know what to do.

349
00:26:41,824 --> 00:26:44,588
Who are these people?
They knew where I was gonna be standing.

350
00:26:44,454 --> 00:26:46,422
They knew exactly
where I was gonna be--

351
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:51,037
-Sara? You there?
-It was you.

352
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:53,548
What are you talking about?

353
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:56,268
-I just need to know where you are.
-Oh, my God.

354
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:25,888
Excuse. We'd Iike to check
on a friend of ours, L.J. Burrows.

355
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:29,124
-He's getting stitches.
-We wanna make sure he's all right.

356
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,741
And you can see him when he's through.
It's policy.

357
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:34,787
-You don't get it.
-I get that that kid defended himself.

358
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:36,575
-Tell us why you attacked him.
-I told you.

359
00:27:36,747 --> 00:27:38,647
-Some guy paid me to.
-Some guy paid you.

360
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,450
-Yeah, of course he did.
-FBI.

361
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:43,893
-What do you mean, somebody paid you?
-What the hell's it sound Iike, man?

362
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:47,299
Some dude gave me 50 bucks
to give the kid a beat down.

363
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:51,056
It's Burrows. He's here.

364
00:27:56,934 --> 00:27:58,333
How you feeling, slugger?

365
00:27:58,988 --> 00:28:00,580
Dad?

366
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,531
We gotta move.

367
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,949
Hospital security, Wing 3-G.

368
00:28:06,054 --> 00:28:09,455
Hospital security, Wing 3-G.

369
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:25,300
-There's not much you can do.
-Oh, boy.

370
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:27,980
Excuse me,
I need to ask you a few questions.

371
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:31,554
I ' m on the follow-up investigation team.
Excuse me.

372
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:36,275
-Gotta go. See you Iater.
-We were just curious.

373
00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:38,692
Did you see if the convicts actually found
what they were digging for?

374
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,303
No, but it sure sounded Iike they did.

375
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:46,564
The Spaniard, he took off
with one of my daughter's camping packs...

376
00:28:46,835 --> 00:28:48,826
...and he Ieft the other ones
in a real tizzy.

377
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:51,096
Sounded Iike he screwed them
over something fierce.

378
00:28:51,394 --> 00:28:52,861
And they just Iet him Ieave?

379
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,676
Well, they weren't happy about it,
but yeah.

380
00:28:55,858 --> 00:28:57,450
He took off on his motorbike.

381
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,531
-Then they Ieft a few minutes Iater.
-Together?

382
00:28:59,756 --> 00:29:02,782
No, the pretty one and the black fellow,
they Ieft first.

383
00:29:02,994 --> 00:29:05,588
And then that dirty Southerner,
he snuck out the back.

384
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:09,054
But he was moving kind of slow, you know,
with the weight of that backpack.

385
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:12,096
-And that disability that he--
-Wait, he had a backpack too?

386
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:14,169
Yes. He came back in...

387
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:18,230
...and slipped this into my brassiere
on his way out.

388
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:20,565
He said it was to cover the damages.

389
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,302
Well, we're gonna need
to keep this as evidence.

390
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,190
Thanks for your time. Get in the car.

391
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,544
Seven-three-six, space...

392
00:29:43,502 --> 00:29:47,268
...three-three-nine, space,
eight-six-eight-seven.

393
00:29:49,142 --> 00:29:51,633
And what exactly are you Iooking for?

394
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:53,083
A pattern. A code.

395
00:29:53,694 --> 00:29:55,252
Anything.

396
00:30:23,884 --> 00:30:26,614
What? What are you trying to tell me,
Michael?

397
00:30:28,297 --> 00:30:32,961
They say people come into your Iife
for a reason.

398
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:39,536
Maybe my reason was to help you
get out of Fox River, you know?

399
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:43,613
-To help you save your brother.
-No.

400
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,232
It's okay, papi.

401
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:56,176
Let me go.

402
00:30:57,172 --> 00:30:59,766
We're a quarter mile downriver
below the dam.

403
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:03,659
It's now or never, Michael.

404
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,069
-I want you to hold your breath, okay?
-Why?

405
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:13,728
Just do it. I'II be right back, I promise.

406
00:31:34,463 --> 00:31:35,862
What the hell are you doing?

407
00:31:37,017 --> 00:31:39,178
All units, redirect to the river.

408
00:31:38,755 --> 00:31:42,213
I want you to go under and then
stick your arm up above the water, high.

409
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,627
AII right.

410
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:48,661
Then when you start running out of air,
wave it back and forth so I can see it.

411
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:50,481
-Okay.
-And I'II come back and get you.

412
00:31:50,663 --> 00:31:51,994
Okay? Give me your hand.

413
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,781
One, two...

414
00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:58,798
...three.

415
00:32:34,013 --> 00:32:36,846
Come on. Come on.

416
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:20,102
Sucre?

417
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,303
Sucre!

418
00:34:01,358 --> 00:34:04,122
-Talk to me.
-Well, there is one possibility...

419
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:06,036
...but it's almost too rudimentary.

420
00:34:06,357 --> 00:34:08,348
We know we're not Iooking
at a phone number...

421
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:10,982
...but maybe
we're not Iooking at numbers at all.

422
00:34:15,543 --> 00:34:18,671
What's important are the letters
that correspond to that number.

423
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:25,191
Three dots, third Ietter: R.

424
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:29,175
Two, D, E.

425
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,641
Three possibilities per number.

426
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,355
That's thousands of letter combinations.

427
00:34:36,895 --> 00:34:39,625
But only one of them spells out a word.

428
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:49,830
The question is where?

429
00:35:01,752 --> 00:35:05,654
-Hey, what are you in the market for?
-Four wheels and a gas pedal.

430
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:09,517
Hey, Petey, it's me.

431
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:12,168
Listen, I got something to tell you.

432
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:14,554
I was wondering
when you were gonna call.

433
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:19,055
Yeah. A Iot has come down
since we Iast talked, and....

434
00:35:19,104 --> 00:35:22,631
Yeah, I know. I heard. You ruined it.

435
00:35:23,006 --> 00:35:24,735
Yeah....

436
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:28,202
-You heard already?
-Well, brother, everybody's heard, man.

437
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:31,630
And Iet me tell you something, man.
Hector is pissed.

438
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,937
-What does Hector have to do with it?
-It was his wedding.

439
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:38,782
-Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
-Your bike. What are you talking about?

440
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,921
-The wedding.
-What about the wedding?

441
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:43,370
Well, you know the part
where you say "I do "?

442
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:46,315
Maricruz said, " I don't."

443
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,441
-She did?
-Left homeboy standing at the altar...

444
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:54,399
...holding his Spam in his hand,
if you know what I'm saying.

445
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:57,756
What were you telling me about my bike?

446
00:36:02,314 --> 00:36:05,408
AII right. I'II go get your keys.

447
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:09,153
We've got a couple of stops to make.
First, there's this place call BIanding.

448
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:12,129
-We meet up with Linc in a couple of days--
-I can't go.

449
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:15,872
She said no, papi.

450
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,838
Maricruz-- Maricruz told that son of a--

451
00:36:18,964 --> 00:36:21,125
She told him no. Can you believe that?

452
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:22,505
-That's great.
-I know.

453
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:27,002
Now, I just....

454
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,725
No, go on. Get your girl.

455
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:32,313
-How about Panama? We said--
-Some other time.

456
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:33,890
Panama's not gonna go anywhere.

457
00:36:35,718 --> 00:36:40,314
And this is in case you run into trouble
down the road.

458
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:47,912
The river.

459
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:50,529
I told you to Ieave me behind.

460
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:52,355
Yeah, well, I tried.

461
00:36:52,191 --> 00:36:55,456
But, you know,
I got tangled up in the rope, so....

462
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:03,945
-Okay, here you go.
-Thanks. And....

463
00:37:05,716 --> 00:37:07,343
Think we'II need another car.

464
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:16,402
Do you really think
the diaper sniper got all of it?

465
00:37:16,536 --> 00:37:18,003
Only one way to find out.

466
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:21,176
If you're Bagwell
and you just got your hands on $5 million...

467
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:22,609
...where would you go?

468
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,069
You think you're the only one
that feels betrayed?

469
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,985
I'm gonna get out of here someday.

470
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:56,662
And when I do...

471
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,647
...don't think I won't remember
what your front steps Iook Iike.

472
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:21,771
Let me get this straight.
You paid that meth head to whup my ass?

473
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,543
Yeah. Feds were waiting for me
to come get you. It was the only way.

474
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,238
-It worked, didn't it?
-Yeah.

475
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,733
Yeah, it got me four stitches.

476
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:33,547
Adds character. Here, take that.

477
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,740
There's some ice in there.
Put it on the eye.

478
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:38,414
Keep the swelling down.

479
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:43,612
I've been in a few fights in my day too.

480
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:47,695
Too many.

481
00:38:50,947 --> 00:38:54,644
"Rendezvous. Sundown. Hot."

482
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:18,012
There's one more bird.

483
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:32,293
CIean it. Every surface,
Iike she never came home. Go.

484
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:00,033
Waiting for your flight from Utah...

485
00:39:59,842 --> 00:40:02,037
...we had a Iittle extra time
for due diligence.

486
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:04,369
I decided to dig a Iittle deeper
on your history.

487
00:40:04,685 --> 00:40:06,050
Or rather Iack of one.

488
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:10,267
Starts off simple enough. Poor family.
Mom Ieaves, cites spousal abuse.

489
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:14,462
Somehow your dad holds on to custody,
and by the Iook of these pediatric meds...

490
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:17,142
...he beat you Iike a harp seal
for the next four years.

491
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:20,361
Big shock: poor abused kid,
not a Iot of options, he joins the military.

492
00:40:21,297 --> 00:40:24,460
Will there be any actual questions
or is this just a show-and-tell?

493
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,993
Okay, I got one.
How does a guy go from Infantry grunt...

494
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,798
...with Iess than stellar marks...

495
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:32,734
...to the Gulf I Special Ops,
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation...

496
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:36,003
...Ieading the Iargest manhunt
this country's ever seen?

497
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:38,672
I have all these dots.

498
00:40:39,374 --> 00:40:41,365
And there's just no way
to connect them.

499
00:40:42,138 --> 00:40:44,732
Looks Iike you need to work
on your clearance Ievel, Dick.

500
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:47,404
-Maybe I'II just work on you.
-You wanna do this?

501
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:51,095
I will chain you to this desk until I get
answers I cannot fertilize my Iawn with.

502
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:52,818
You sure you wanna do this?

503
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:55,587
I know what they tell you to do overseas,
AIex...

504
00:40:55,711 --> 00:40:57,440
...and Iet me make it perfectly clear.

505
00:40:57,764 --> 00:41:00,824
We do not do it on American soil.

506
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,689
Sir, there's a phone call for you.

507
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:04,179
I'II take it Iater.

508
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:06,960
Sir, you're gonna wanna take this now.

509
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:14,994
Yeah?

510
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:16,660
Yes, sir.

511
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,568
I'm with him now.

512
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:25,061
Yes, sir. Bye.

513
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:30,576
Where you going?

514
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:33,380
I thought we were really starting
to get somewhere.

515
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:37,101
Let's go.

516
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,785
AIex.

517
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,124
You got something for me?

518
00:42:02,424 --> 00:42:03,948
Open it.

519
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:08,909
The numbers correlate to the Ietters
on a phone.

520
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:11,897
Only on this one, none of the possible
combinations make sense.

521
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:15,171
We think it's a Iocation.
A rendezvous point for Michael Scofield.

522
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:17,181
You find it, you find him.

523
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,785
You could've gotten me
out of there sooner.

524
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,452
Even we have to go
through certain channels...

525
00:42:22,116 --> 00:42:25,176
...to make sure
things appear on the up-and-up.

526
00:42:25,571 --> 00:42:28,131
You know all about that,
don't you, AIex?

527
00:42:28,453 --> 00:42:30,648
Keeping up appearances.

528
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:34,126
Good.

529
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:40,126
I'm just making sure that we're still clear
on the directive of this manhunt.

530
00:42:40,387 --> 00:42:44,380
You know, I understand the reasoning
behind Burrows and Scofield.

531
00:42:44,824 --> 00:42:47,349
But the other men,
criminals that they may be...

532
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,797
-...there's nothing in their profiles--
-You've been hired to do a job.

533
00:42:51,337 --> 00:42:54,500
The reasoning does not concern you.

534
00:42:54,661 --> 00:42:56,390
You don't ask any questions about us...

535
00:42:56,077 --> 00:42:59,877
...maybe we'II continue to make sure no one
asks questions about you. Are we clear?

536
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,488
They all die.

537
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,621
They all die.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
