1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:02,826
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,699
Welcome home, boss.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,373
-Where's Mommy?
-Mommy's gonna meet us later, okay?

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,337
-I'm not a murderer.
-Terrence Steadman.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,538
-The president's brother.
-I didn't do it.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:20,218
-Mr. Steadman, it's contraband.
-I brought it to protect myself.

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,581
That's what we're here for.

8
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,950
Can I write a check?
Because I don't have--

9
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,422
Hello, Mrs. Hollander.

10
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,117
Teddy's home.

11
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,262
It's Pam. What's going on?

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,124
I love you.

13
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,424
Give Cam a kiss for me, okay?

14
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,958
You call this number again,
you're a dead man.

15
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,865
You want my help.
I want my job back.

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,233
-What's your plan?
-When brothers get in the van.

17
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,772
It's the last thing they'll do.

18
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,069
Paul Kellerman is ready to move on
the caravan outside of Albuquerque.

19
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,736
When it goes down,
there's to be lots of bullets flying.

20
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,610
I need you there to make sure
Paul Kellerman catches one.

21
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,955
President Reynolds ruined your life...

22
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,560
...she ruined my life.
You wanna take the bitch down...

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,391
...you found your inside man.
But it's gotta be right now.

24
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,089
Let's go.

25
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,473
I know the way out.

26
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,299
I want a team flanking the west.

27
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,466
Give me another team
down by the river.

28
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,217
Man down. Give me a Medivac, ASAP.

29
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,320
Officer Tuggle.

30
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,632
Officer Tuggle?

31
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,432
I'm looking for Alexander Mahone.
I'm his direct supervisor.

32
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,473
I'm sorry to tell you this, sir,
but your boy's been shot.

33
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,972
Who are you?

34
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,743
I used to work for the president.

35
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,513
Why are you helping us?

36
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,557
Lay down on the floor. Now.

37
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,934
Federal agent. Let me through.

38
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:05,216
Air support is telling us that they saw
your vehicle traveling down Route 46.

39
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:09,583
Forty-six is a possible exit route
for the convicts. I was securing it.

40
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,657
No offense, sir,
but we're searching every vehicle.

41
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,817
No offense. Either you let me through
or you get me a supervisor.

42
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,190
I'm supervising this roadblock,
Agent Kellerman.

43
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,064
I'm sorry, but I need you
to get out of the vehicle.

44
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,198
Sergeant Humphries.

45
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,834
Burrows and Scofield
have been loose for less than1 0 minutes.

46
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,204
That means every second is critical.
So if you detain me...

47
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,278
...for one moment more,
I will have all of your jobs.

48
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,005
Do you understand me?

49
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,583
-Go ahead.
-What?

50
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,986
Just let him go.

51
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,907
You still haven't answered my question.

52
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,602
Why am I helping you?

53
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,905
Because the enemy
of my enemy is my friend.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,277
You said something about taking down
the president. I assume you have a plan.

55
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,154
I do.

56
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,653
I used to have a Great Dane.
We had to put her down.

57
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,088
It was very peaceful.

58
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,623
One minute she was breathing,
the next she wasn't.

59
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,359
Turn around.

60
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,778
Get up.

61
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,785
Give me one reason why
I shouldn't blow your brains out.

62
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,226
Because I can give you the one
thing that's gonna set you free.

63
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,189
I know where Terrence Steadman is.

64
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,975
How do you know
where Steadman is?

65
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,974
Because I arranged this whole thing.

66
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,772
-You arranged to set me up?
-Right.

67
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,780
You arranged the killing
of all the people I know.

68
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,009
I was given orders.
I executed those orders.

69
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,121
And now I have a bull's-eye on my chest,
just like you two.

70
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,484
-I don't trust him.
-Hey.

71
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,865
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

72
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,861
You guys want to keep running, fine.

73
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,596
You wanna be free, get in the car.

74
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,865
Last time I'm gonna offer.

75
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,692
What's up, fish?

76
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,438
Looks like you're having
a tough time of it.

77
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,971
-I'm all right.
-Well, I'm just curious.

78
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,742
Why don't you hang out with the rest
of the ex-guards who are locked up here?

79
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,814
Oh, yeah.

80
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,580
There ain't any.

81
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,381
It's just you.

82
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,759
Hey, hold. Hold up, hold up.

83
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,128
Now, I got what's called a mutual
beneficial arrangement in my mind.

84
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,329
I'll look out after you.
Make sure nobody get up in your mix.

85
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,365
And all you got to do is bring me
your dessert after the next meal.

86
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,300
It's real simple.

87
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,243
I'm just looking to do my time.
I don't want any trouble.

88
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,942
Yeah. It's what you want,
and it's what I want.

89
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,745
Your dessert after the next chow.

90
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,982
You bring it to me. You got it?

91
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,693
No. Wrong guy.

92
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,854
Hey.

93
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,292
Break it up, convicts.

94
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,223
We're good, boss.

95
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,792
We're good.

96
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,596
You bring me my treat...

97
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,673
...or this goes to the next level.

98
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,367
Do you understand?

99
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,577
He asked you a question, boy.

100
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,616
Yeah.

101
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,884
-I ain't hear him. You?
-I ain't hear him.

102
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,924
Yeah. Okay.

103
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,389
See how easy that was?

104
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,864
We're gonna be good friends now.

105
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,018
There's no reason for you to be scared,
Suzie Q...

106
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,356
...because you see, I've forgiven you.

107
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:50,424
And you, in turn can forgive me
for my indiscretions...

108
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:56,125
...which is far in the past they're nothing
but specks in our respective rear views.

109
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,864
It's been such a long time.

110
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,039
You look lovely.

111
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:12,079
Okay, let's go. Right now.
We can go away.

112
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,985
Spend some time together.

113
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,418
Susan, I'm not a Victrola,
so please don't play me like one.

114
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,884
There's not a white man's chance
in Harlem...

115
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,289
...you'd ever leave your children behind.

116
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,429
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,163
Don't fret, now.

118
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,634
When you came to Fox River...

119
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,671
...and you spat at me
like I was some kind of...

120
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,875
...rabid animal.

121
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,581
I was happy...

122
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,579
...because such a visceral reaction could
only come from a woman who still cares.

123
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,359
The children don't know.
I didn't wanna scare them...

124
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,052
...so I never told them about you
so please don't--

125
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:00,130
That is so perfect.

126
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,928
Because you see what we got
here now?

127
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,172
We got ourselves a clean slate.

128
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,943
Right?

129
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,320
So, this is the conspiracy, huh?

130
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,549
A bunch of little boys in suits
running around trying to kill each other?

131
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,756
It's pathetic.

132
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,795
Well, you were a little more
formidable than we anticipated.

133
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,359
We don't need compliments
out of you, jackass.

134
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,364
Oh, yes, there it is.

135
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,231
-The winning Burrows personality.
-Shut your mouth and drive.

136
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,169
The one we really knew would win
over a jury. Good work.

137
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,808
Mr. Kim.

138
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,710
What the hell is going on out there?

139
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,477
It was touch and go for a minute...

140
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,087
...but I got everything handled.

141
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,620
Mahone's been shot.

142
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,055
Yes, I know, Bill, I was there.
I saw Burrows pull the trigger.

143
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,889
-We lost a valuable asset, but--
-Mahone's alive.

144
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,100
That's good. It looked bad, so.

145
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,759
Where are Burrows and Scofield?

146
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,662
Burrows and Scofield are dead.

147
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,104
And they're in my SUV.
I'm heading out to bury them. Right now.

148
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,210
Don't bury them.

149
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,011
I need visual confirmation.

150
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,108
I'll get you a photo.

151
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,251
I'll say it one more time.

152
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,750
-Don't bury them.
-You know what would be nice to hear?

153
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,556
A thank you.

154
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,352
I'll report back
when they're in the ground.

155
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,920
You leave that on, they'll trace it.

156
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,965
Yeah. Secret Service.
It's untraceable, but thanks.

157
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,584
Hey, baby girl.

158
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,557
What?

159
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,058
What's the matter?

160
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,556
-Where's Mommy?
-Oh, come on.

161
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,428
Now, I told you that Mommy
was helping a friend.

162
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,592
All right? Now, we're gonna see
her real soon.

163
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,135
When?

164
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,768
Baby, we are gonna be
with your mommy real soon.

165
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,069
I promise you that.

166
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,677
Okay?

167
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,303
I don't believe you.

168
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,410
Dede.

169
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,179
Dede.

170
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,629
Yo, Trey. It's me, man.

171
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,359
-What's up?
-Yo, what's going on with Kacee?

172
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,867
I'm at the courthouse.
She's getting arraigned soon.

173
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,028
Okay. Well, you talk to her?
Is she all right?

174
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,698
She's in jail, so, no, she's not all right.
What the hell happened?

175
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,710
-You think I wanted it this way?
-Whatever.

176
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,973
Gotta go.
My lawyer's gonna be here any minute.

177
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,810
No, no. Listen, listen.

178
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,613
Now, look, I want you to tell Kacee
to put it all on me, all right?

179
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,185
And she didn't know what to do.
She was scared. Okay? All that.

180
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,459
Yeah, I already told her to do that.

181
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,898
I'll do the talking.

182
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,509
-Owen Kravecki?
-That's me. Hey.

183
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,475
Hey. Ben and Phil.

184
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,348
Let's go, before our wives
figure out this is a fishing trip.

185
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,213
-Where's your gear?
-I keep it up north. Okay?

186
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,979
How long is the flight?

187
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,713
An hour, 40.

188
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,570
We don't have a choice.

189
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,954
Glad you're awake.

190
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,051
Collarbone and rotator cuff.

191
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,424
Six inches to the right, and you're dead.

192
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,564
Yeah, he just woke up.

193
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,100
Mr. Mahone.

194
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,803
Bill Kim. You're a lucky man.

195
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,748
-Am l?
-Kellerman finished the job you couldn 't.

196
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,484
But he, unfortunately, is still out there...

197
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,417
...and he's a loose end.

198
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,248
Finish what you were supposed to
take care of.

199
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,217
Something funny?

200
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,463
Kellerman's more of a loose end
than you realize.

201
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,128
He shot me.

202
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:07,129
The guy you wanted to double-cross
screwed you first.

203
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,568
Scofield and Burrows?

204
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,403
Are probably alive...

205
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,435
...and on the run with Kellerman.

206
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,040
Have a good day, Kimmy.

207
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,490
We neutered Kellerman.

208
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,752
He doesn't even officially exist
anymore.

209
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,831
He knows everything.

210
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,801
Reports have been coming in
from New Mexico officials...

211
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,039
... that escaped convicts
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows...

212
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,916
...have somehow managed
to extricate themselves...

213
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,714
...from a transport van that was bringing
them back to the Chicago area.

214
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,551
According to this early information,
the convicts were....

215
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,283
You're great.

216
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,622
T op-notch. I swear to God.

217
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,263
Don ' t get yourself worked up,
Mr. Steadman.

218
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,732
I was supposed to have my life
back by now.

219
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,633
Playing golf...

220
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,472
...going to movies...

221
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,968
...seeing people. But because
you guys can't get a handle...

222
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,314
...on an engineer and a petty crook...

223
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,911
...I've been a ship in a bottle
for over three years.

224
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,814
You're perfectly safe here.

225
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,987
I wish.

226
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,690
I just spoke to Kim.

227
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,837
He wants you to finish the job.

228
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,438
Yeah?

229
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,167
That's not gonna happen.

230
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,007
This isn't a request.

231
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,804
And this isn't a negotiation.

232
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,515
Kim and Kellerman
can try to kill each other all day long.

233
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,949
But I'm out.

234
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,120
You must've forgotten how discreet
we've been with what we know.

235
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,223
Go tell about Shales.
In fact, I will.

236
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,185
I killed a predator, a man who
tortured and raped women...

237
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,125
...and I buried him in my back yard.
I'll do the time.

238
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,197
I don't care anymore. I'm out.

239
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,729
Is that clear enough for you?

240
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,569
My man.

241
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,780
That's delicious.

242
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,409
Whoa, hold up there. Hold, hold up.

243
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,582
We got a problem.

244
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,117
That's one brownie.

245
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,183
There's five of my boys.

246
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,725
You see the position you put me in?

247
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,661
They gotta stand with their stomachs
growling while I savor this delicious treat.

248
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,466
That makes me look like a real ass.

249
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,373
Are you trying to make me
look like an ass?

250
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,709
You said the deal was I was supposed
to bring you one dessert.

251
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,906
Yeah. Well.

252
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,482
I'm a fickle bitch.

253
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,280
Now, it's five desserts...

254
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,146
...every meal.

255
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,785
Now, if you can't come up with that...

256
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:53,492
...there are other ways
to making me happy.

257
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,866
Well, I got some other candy on me,
if you want some of that.

258
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,630
Well, break it out, bitch.
It's all good. You all want some candy?

259
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,710
Guard's coming.

260
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,002
If memory serves, I was at
Storytime Village that day too.

261
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,999
And I'm not in any of these pictures?

262
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,437
Could've sworn I was.

263
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,168
I'm just teasing, baby.

264
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,644
Every woman has burned
the photographs of her paramour...

265
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:47,581
...only to later realize her love burns
even hotter than the flames she used.

266
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,256
Please.

267
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:00,992
Teddy.

268
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,598
Uncle Teddy.

269
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,765
How's my girl been?

270
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:06,962
Good.

271
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,406
You still getting more A's
than an aardvark?

272
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:13,067
-Yeah. I missed you.
-Oh, same here, shortcake.

273
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,576
Yes, I painted my hair.

274
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,148
Look at you, Zack.

275
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,308
You are a boy no more.

276
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,715
I'm gonna have to lend you
my razor soon enough.

277
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,486
What are you doing here?
Mom said you got a job on an oil rig.

278
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,726
That's right. Right out in the
middle of the ocean.

279
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,457
But those metallic beasts
are dangerous.

280
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,100
Got myself injured.

281
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,968
Don't be, don't be frightened now, sugar.

282
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,704
The good lawyers at Dewey,
Cheatem and Howe...

283
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:46,435
...got me a million bones
for every digit I lost.

284
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,136
Five million dollars?

285
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,613
Which means with all that cash...

286
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,050
...I can do anything I want now.
And all I want to do...

287
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,157
...is spend all my money
and all my time...

288
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,654
...with you.

289
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,599
What's the neighborhood like?

290
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,744
No neighborhood.
The house sits on 50 acres.

291
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,276
We coming out the way we go in?

292
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,038
No. There's a back road we'll take.

293
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,115
-How many guards?
-Usually none.

294
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,946
At this point, I really couldn't tell you.

295
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,945
The second I feel this thing going bad...

296
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,057
...you get a bullet in the head.

297
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,154
I'd expect nothing less.

298
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,997
I will inform you every half-hour.

299
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,560
Understood.

300
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,202
Private jet was chartered
by Owen Kravecki this morning.

301
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,497
-Headed where?
-Montana.

302
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:49,832
Stop it from taking off.

303
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,340
It's already on the ground, sir.

304
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,000
Call Steadman.

305
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,311
If that's my sister,
I would like to speak to her.

306
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,414
Yes?

307
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,661
Right away, sir.

308
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,925
Evac.

309
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,833
Mr. Steadman, do you have a jacket?
We need to leave.

310
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,799
Leave? What? No.

311
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,837
Agents'll be arriving shortly
to take you to a safe house.

312
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,702
What do I need to be kept safe from?

313
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,236
Do you have a jacket, sir?

314
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,402
I don't wanna leave.
I wanna talk to my sister.

315
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,013
I've been authorized to use force
if necessary.

316
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,083
Now, is there anything you'd like
to bring?

317
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,215
My meds.

318
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,688
Go with him. Car's here in five minutes.

319
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,365
Well, I don't know, Stella.
She won't come out.

320
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,905
Who wants to be up in the trailer
all day, huh? Would you?

321
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,405
Exactly. Me, neither.

322
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,907
You feel like making a pie
or something?

323
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,478
A little cherry, or lemon meringue, or--

324
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,137
Daddy.

325
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,952
Is Mommy in trouble, like you?

326
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,159
Sweetheart, come here.

327
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,528
Come here.

328
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,793
Now, you listen to me, okay?

329
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:28,367
Mommy did nothing wrong.

330
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,070
She's helping out a friend.

331
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,910
Okay?

332
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,350
Okay, let me go see how Mommy's doing,
all right?

333
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,180
-I wanna talk to her.
-No, no, no.

334
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,584
You sit here, like a good little girl, okay?

335
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,018
Don't give me that.

336
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,217
-Hello.
-Things are looking up.

337
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,625
That's what I wanted to hear.
Kick it down to me.

338
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,296
Her lawyer knows what he's doing.
He thinks he can get the bail reduced.

339
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,028
Good. All right, well, listen.
When Kacee gets out...

340
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,270
...I want you to deliver
this message for me, okay?

341
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,301
Tell her...

342
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,040
...that we can all get lost.

343
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,304
You want her to jump bail now?

344
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,779
Be glad you ain't in front of my face,
I'd have my hands around your neck.

345
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,440
Punk, just deliver the message.

346
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,052
Okay. Then what you all gonna do?
Go live in a cave?

347
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,617
-I got a plan, all right?
-Let's hear it.

348
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,920
This guy back in my unit...

349
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,995
...when I was in lraq.

350
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,533
He used to go to Alaska,
work at these fish hatcheries, man.

351
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:30,861
They pay you cash.

352
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,630
-And nobody asks questions.
-Alaska?

353
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,036
Yeah, Alaska, man.
They don 't bother you up there, man.

354
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,473
You know, me, Kacee and Dede,
we could be a family again. You feel me?

355
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:41,868
Man, you don't quit.

356
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,106
You're damned straight I don't quit.

357
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,980
Do I get to know where I'm going?

358
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,316
You'll get all the information
you need upon arrival.

359
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,154
-Yes?
-Move Steadman to Location Beta.

360
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,554
We're sending a car.

361
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,521
It's already here, sir.

362
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,388
Couldn't be.

363
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,024
The car just left.

364
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,127
Weapons down.

365
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,969
Now.

366
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,105
Down.

367
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,716
Put your weapons down.

368
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,548
Don't get stupid.

369
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,782
Put your weapons down on the ground.
Now.

370
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,128
Terrence, step away. Get in the car.

371
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,326
You look pretty good for a dead man.

372
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,126
-Get in the car.
-Wait, wait, wait.

373
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,531
-Who's there?
-It's Kellerman. He's got Steadman.

374
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,898
Do not let him escape.

375
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,203
Kill Steadman. Kill them all, now.

376
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:54,742
-Paul, please. Don't-- Don't kill me.
-Get in. Get in the car.

377
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,516
Let's go.

378
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,230
Vomiting. It's the worst side effect
of anesthesia.

379
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,605
That should be the last of it.

380
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,506
-You figure I'm on empty by now?
-Yeah.

381
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,386
Pam.

382
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,918
Alex, Cameron's been hurt.

383
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,686
-What happened?
-lt was a car. Hit and run.

384
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,955
He's in the hospital.
His leg is broken in two places.

385
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,031
I'll be on the next flight to Colorado.

386
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,862
-He's in surgery now.
-I'll be right there. Just hold on.

387
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,163
They won't let me seem him.
They called me.

388
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,534
I got right here
and they won't let me see him.

389
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,144
Pam, please, just keep it together
until I get there. Can you do that for me?

390
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,336
Please. Please hurry.

391
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,645
Mr. Mahone, you cannot get on a plane.

392
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,376
You need to stay at least another day
for observation.

393
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,814
You've been shot.

394
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,046
Mr. Mahone, please.

395
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,515
-I've gotta go see my son.
-Mr. Mahone, I understand.

396
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,853
Please. At least stay and talk to a doctor.

397
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,553
Taxi. Taxi.

398
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,027
How's your boy?

399
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,039
Tib-fib fractures are bad.

400
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,643
But if the growth plate's affected
there's a whole host of problems.

401
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,339
-You made a mistake.
-No, you did.

402
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,209
You think you can just quit
like you work at a post office?

403
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,211
Now, you're needed back in.

404
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,580
Go clean up your mess.

405
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:39,986
Maybe there won't be another accident
on the streets of Durango, Colorado.

406
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,261
Understand?

407
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,796
Every road shut down. Every car searched.

408
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,409
I don't care if it's a group of nuns.
Their camper gets turned inside out.

409
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,773
-Logistically speaking, every road's gonna--
-It's Montana.

410
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,641
Not Manhattan.

411
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,610
-Get it done.
-Yes, sir.

412
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,721
If we get a camera, we can take
a picture of him holding a newspaper.

413
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,123
If we put that online,
that'll prove he's alive.

414
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:21,231
It'll prove that we found a guy that looks
kind of like the president's brother.

415
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,890
-Fingerprints. Dental records.
-We whitewashed him.

416
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,537
We pulled his teeth,
burned off his fingerprints.

417
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,694
DNA.

418
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,501
To compare against the homeless guy
we killed and put in Steadman's car.

419
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,769
But we destroyed
all exterior DNA samples...

420
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,345
...so that there'd be nothing
to compare them to.

421
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,277
There's gotta be someone somewhere
who can identify this man.

422
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,009
Which is why we did the surgery.

423
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:44,622
Cheekbones raised two centimeters,
ears lowered a quarter of an inch.

424
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,121
Not so much that someone
wouldn't recognize him...

425
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,523
...but enough that any forensic comparison
of a photograph of that man...

426
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,720
...would conclude that he is a look-alike.

427
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,922
A hoax. Trust me.

428
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,625
We are very good at what we do.

429
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,172
Please, just let me go.

430
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,367
Terrence, you made every man
in this room a prisoner, including yourself.

431
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,770
-It's time to set us free.
-Nothing you do will work.

432
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,578
-They will not let it--
-Cut the victim act, Terrence.

433
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,313
He's happy to play along
when he was lining his pockets...

434
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,219
...with taxpayer money funneled
through EcoField. And then...

435
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,518
...when the indictment is about to fall...

436
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,889
...who do you come running to for help,
Terrence?

437
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:33,133
We're gonna stay here for a day or two
until they think we're thousand miles away.

438
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,502
And then we're gonna make our way
to D.C.

439
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,138
Okay?

440
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,836
So that's the plan? We take him to a city
crawling with Company and Feds?

441
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,349
And government agents still in power
working from the inside with your father.

442
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:51,648
People who can get that pain in the ass
to safely tell his story on the record.

443
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:55,281
We just stroll right into the lion's den
then, huh? Pray we don't get mauled.

444
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,152
I don't think they're gonna come to
Montana, so we're gonna go to them.

445
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,365
No. Leave her alone.

446
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:07,631
-What do you want with her?
-What I want is to date her.

447
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,768
What do you want...?

448
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,643
-I'll make you some more popcorn.
-Honey.

449
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,874
If any of us could eat any more corn,
I'd be amazed.

450
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,347
See what I did there, Gracey?

451
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:24,955
Indian word for corn is "maize,"
and I just said, "amazed."

452
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,854
I don't get it. I'm corn-fused.

453
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,492
You are smarter than a bee sting.

454
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:35,224
The second female president
of these United States, right here...

455
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,459
...watching TV with us.

456
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,870
Look what I did.

457
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,231
-Honey, that's all right.
-No, I'll get a rag.

458
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,774
No, I can--

459
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,247
I thought we had wiped the slate clean.

460
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:57,846
Please.

461
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,755
I thought we had put the past
where it belonged.

462
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:06,090
We did. We did put the past
where it belonged.

463
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,263
Do not lie to me, woman.

464
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,664
After turn coating me to the authorities...

465
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:15,430
...and everything we had. After breaking
my heart into so many pieces...

466
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,805
...that I will never be able to find them all
you can at least do me the favor...

467
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,674
...as to not stand there
and lie to my face.

468
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,314
Mom?

469
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,773
Zack, you get your ass
back on that couch.

470
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,412
Get Gracey. Go.

471
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,146
Give that to me.

472
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,824
I gave you all a chance.

473
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,759
Remember that.

474
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,023
Open up 22.

475
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,360
Opening 22.

476
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,399
Dude, you're crazy.

477
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,302
Is that what the other cons are saying?

478
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,170
-Yeah.
-Good.

479
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,802
But you took it to Banks. I don't think
you wanna be messing with him, man.

480
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,417
I'll mess with anybody tries
to punk me out.

481
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:37,347
Hey, you know,
I've just been testing you.

482
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,389
Yeah, well, the test results came back...

483
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,355
...and top bunk's mine now.

484
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,654
You got a problem with that?

485
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,707
-Hey, what's up, Stolte?
-You just screwed up, Brad. Big time.

486
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,936
No. I had a message to send
and that message got delivered.

487
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,513
The guy you schlocked, Banks.

488
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:08,174
He's got connections with the guards
working nights.

489
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:12,756
Word is, Banks is gonna have you
pulled out of your cell tonight.

490
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,250
-Well, can't you do nothing?
-Yeah.

491
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,224
I can warn you which is what I'm doing.

492
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,660
Can't you talk to some
of the guys working nights?

493
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,426
They're working nights
because you put them on nights.

494
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,501
You should've treated them better.

495
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,399
They ain't gonna do you any favors.

496
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,006
Well, I treated you right, didn't l?

497
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,732
Come on, Stolte.

498
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,139
Can't you do something? Please.

499
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,212
You did treat me right...

500
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,542
...but there is nothing I can do now...

501
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,616
...except warn you...

502
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,844
...watch your back.

503
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,098
We can use the roads that the
rangers use in Glacier National Park.

504
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:58,634
They don't patrol them at night. Get up into
Canada, head east. Cut through New York.

505
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:03,035
And the borders won't be a problem.
No, nobody'll look for us there.

506
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,732
-This fun for you, Terrence? Really?
-No, this isn't fun.

507
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,573
What was fun was when Caroline
and I would talk about you...

508
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,542
...and the schoolboy crush
that you had on her.

509
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,374
He proposed to her.

510
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:21,716
You actually thought that you would be
the first husband? Serf who would be king?

511
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,417
Caroline.

512
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,317
We laughed so hard--

513
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,398
You stood and watched them kill Veronica.

514
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,558
-Burrows.
-And you did nothing.

515
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,465
-Burrows.
-She died because of you.

516
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,213
-Linc--
-Shut up.

517
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,946
Burrows, he has no value to us dead.
He has no identity.

518
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,610
-Kill him, he's just a John Doe.
-Put your gun down.

519
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,018
-When he puts his down.
-Linc, we're so close.

520
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:57,158
Was it worth it?
Killing those people? Ruining my life?

521
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:00,126
-Get a handle on your brother.
-Shut up. You're not helping.

522
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,925
Linc, you don't want to do this.

523
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,567
Trust me.

524
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,133
This isn't what you want.

525
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,197
You don't want to do this, okay?
Trust me.

526
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,750
So many people dead.

527
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,122
And he gets to live.

528
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,969
Hello? Hello?

529
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,563
They denied bail.

530
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,340
-What?
-The judge didn't buy that it was all you.

531
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,170
Kacee's going into the system now.

532
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,177
Aiding an escaped con.
She's looking at major time, man.

533
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:04,525
Now, I want you to tell her lawyer, all right,
you listen to me. You tell her lawyer...

534
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,789
I love you.

535
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,101
-...tell her lawyer I'll turn myself in, okay?
-No.

536
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,601
Kacee says you need to run.

537
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,569
If you turn yourself in,
Dede won't have either of you.

538
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,102
And they'll just throw her
into foster care.

539
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,039
Look, I'm gonna hang up
this phone right now...

540
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,340
...because I might say something
I'll regret.

541
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,641
Yo--

542
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,013
You just take care of Dede.

543
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,227
You know, Zack...

544
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,528
...my daddy wasn't really in the picture
much when I was growing up.

545
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,807
As a result, I never really learned
the art of carpentry.

546
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,675
But I figure Jesus was a carpenter,
and his daddy wasn't around to teach him...

547
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,643
...so I taught myself.

548
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:03,210
Over time, I got to be
a pretty good swinger of the hammer.

549
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,816
Now, the good news is...

550
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:11,894
...unlike my papa
and the Great Almighty, I am here...

551
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,621
...for good.

552
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,624
Don't make no mistake about it.

553
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,234
We will be a family...

554
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,934
...if it kills us.

555
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,452
It's so sweet.

556
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,465
Car's out front. Let's move out.

557
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,699
These two will never
make it in a car together.

558
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,309
-You keep your brother in check.
-You don't know him.

559
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,505
Then get my gun from him.
We don't have time for this.

560
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,979
You still think you're running
this show, don't you?

561
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,947
You still think I'm not?

562
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,791
Yes, I'd like the number for
Channel 1 1 News, please.

563
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,125
What are you doing?

564
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,058
This is not the plan. Hang up.

565
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,429
Yes, connect me. I'll hold.

566
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,401
Scofield, you call the news,
they call the cops.

567
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:30,901
Yes, put me through.

568
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,508
Hang up.

569
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,911
Hang up the phone now.

570
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,249
Hang it up.

571
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,785
Channel Eleven News. Can I help you?

572
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,015
This is Michael Scofield.

573
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,422
I'm at the Cutback Motel, room 1 1.

574
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,058
And I want to turn myself in.

575
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:04,667
Bradlee.

576
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,744
Bradlee.

577
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,114
Warden's gone home, bitch.

578
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,222
The mice are gonna play.

579
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,151
Bradlee.

580
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,797
Bradlee.

581
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,225
Bradlee.

582
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:36,195
If anything jumps off, you get my back.
I won't forget it.

583
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,740
Why don't you just forget it right now?

584
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,936
Here in this cell,
you're top bunk. Out there...

585
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,780
...you're on your own.

586
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,712
Bradlee.

587
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,982
You want a piece of me, you sons
of bitches? Come and get me.

588
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,750
You hear me?

589
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,887
I ain't scared of you.

590
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,361
I ain't scared of nothing.

591
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:08,430
Bradlee.

592
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,136
Start praying.

593
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,746
Yes?

594
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,683
Mr. Kim.

595
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,856
I just wanted you to know...

596
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,658
...that I'm getting back to work.

597
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,267
Good.

598
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,369
So I take it you got my message.

599
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,165
Oh, yeah.

600
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,842
Loud and clear.

601
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,119
Please don't do this.
Please, come on, please.

602
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,558
I'm sorry, Terrence, it's too late.
The press is already on their way.

603
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,458
You can put the guns away now.

604
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,595
This goes wrong,
you guys are on your own.

605
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:14,067
No, if I go back home. Okay?
Let me, please. I'll go home.

606
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,433
You can't go home, Terrence.
None of us can, okay?

607
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,632
So just relax. Keep your head.

608
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,569
Okay, okay, okay.

609
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,478
-Terrence.
-Terrence, Terrence.

610
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,013
I'm leaving.

611
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,544
Terrence.
We can't let you do that, Terrence.

612
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,816
All we need is your mouth.
I will shoot out your knees right now.

613
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,257
I never liked you, Paul.
I won't hesitate to take your life.

614
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,427
All right, just....

615
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,034
Terrence, listen to me.

616
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,692
Just listen.

617
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:50,165
Terrence, for once in your life,
do the right thing.

618
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,074
All right?

619
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,775
So many people have suffered
because of this, because of you.

620
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,209
But when the press get here...

621
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,350
...you can tell the truth.

622
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,213
You can end this.

623
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:07,420
What is in it for me? Disgrace?
Life in prison?

624
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,286
You're already in prison, Terrence.

625
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,489
How many people have to die
so you can stay in some cabin...

626
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,597
...in the woods? It's over.

627
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,606
Okay.

628
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,400
Okay.

629
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,543
-Sorry.
