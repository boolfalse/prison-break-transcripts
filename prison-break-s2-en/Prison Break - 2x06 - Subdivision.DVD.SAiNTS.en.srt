1
00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:02,677
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:05,115
Mr. Kim. Sara Tancredi. I'm on it.

3
00:00:05,183 --> 00:00:07,378
-Pursuing her the best use of your time?
-It is.

4
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:10,219
-I'II Iet the president know.
-I contact the president.

5
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:12,330
I'II contact her.

6
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:17,392
No family with Patoshik?

7
00:00:17,503 --> 00:00:18,936
-Nothing?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,132
Until about four years ago
when he killed them.

9
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:25,225
Fernando Sucre.
He was in Las Vegas around 2.

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,509
Out west. Just Iike Bagwell and Franklin.

11
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:31,713
You know D.B. Cooper? The money's
in Utah and they're all going to get it.

12
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:33,882
You're one of them Fox River boys.

13
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:45,775
-Come on, you got the map?
-No. Someone else does.

14
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:49,580
Before I destroyed it, I committed it
to my photographic memory.

15
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:53,951
I have the information, you have
the manual requirements necessary...

16
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:55,919
...to unearth
Westmoreland's buried booty.

17
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:58,365
-Get in.
-Okay.

18
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:02,141
Should be dead ahead.

19
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,256
The bastards built over it.

20
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:06,776
It's gone.

21
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:18,645
We have to open up in 1 5 minutes.

22
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:21,413
-So? That doesn't matter. I dare you.
-I said no.

23
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:24,133
I dare you, please.

24
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,066
The ranch is gone, Michael.

25
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,935
Well, the five million might not be.

26
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,983
And you're gonna find it how?

27
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:06,588
What, you got a divining rod
tattooed on your ass?

28
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:08,384
I don't wanna hear anything
from you...

29
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,210
...other than what your photographic
memory spits out regarding that map!

30
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,566
You watch your tone with me, boy.

31
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:18,911
I will watch you get tossed to the side
of the road to fend for yourself, boy.

32
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:21,311
Because if you can't remember
where that silo was...

33
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,343
...you're worthless to us.

34
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:25,686
-Yo, fools, Iet me out.
-Shut up.

35
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,286
-The map!
-Okay, okay. AII right, all right, all right.

36
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:30,539
Let me out, boss.

37
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:32,987
The ranch was in the center of a box.

38
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:36,354
Sheep Road on one side,
Kokosing Road perpendicular.

39
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,217
In the center of the property
was the ranch house...

40
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:43,386
...and the ranch house
was surrounded by trees.

41
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:45,868
Let me out.

42
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:58,376
Every tree here is a year old at most...

43
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:00,729
...except those.

44
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:04,574
Where's the silo?

45
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:12,030
Inside the trees,
I wanna say on the Ieft...

46
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,555
...but that may have been a barn.

47
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:18,138
I remembered the best I could, gents,
but I didn't know this place...

48
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,040
...would now be smothered
in tract homes.

49
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,324
So, you know, I'm sorry
that I'm not Rain Man over here.

50
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,849
-AIex Mahone. How are you?
-Lyle Sands.

51
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,943
We've been briefed
on all the men at Iarge.

52
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:35,262
The full force and resources
of the entire Salt Lake City Field Office...

53
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:36,523
...are at your disposal.

54
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:39,698
Thank you. Do you have the files
my office requested on D.B. Cooper?

55
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:43,144
We're pulling them now. And this is
the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?

56
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:46,102
Correct. If I can get those files immediately,
I'd appreciate it.

57
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:49,408
Sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River 8?

58
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,143
I am. And they're here in Utah
to get D.B. Cooper's money.

59
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,508
So how about those files, Lyle?

60
00:04:56,511 --> 00:05:01,539
-Silo. Silo, silo.
-This is stupid.

61
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,046
-We're gonna get made out here.
-AII right, shut it. I think I remember.

62
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:09,846
If I had to bet, I'd Iay it all on the silo
being on the Ieft of the ranch house...

63
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:11,186
...inside the trees.

64
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:14,627
No. It's outside the trees.

65
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:16,486
Right there.

66
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:20,568
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.

67
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:24,671
They were all planted at the same time
but those two didn't get as much sunlight.

68
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:26,293
Something was in their way.

69
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,901
The silo.

70
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,652
Our money should be right there,
under that garage.

71
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,439
You better be right, boy.

72
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,593
This isn't a high-end subdivision.

73
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,579
They slapped this place up overnight.

74
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,824
The silo's foundations
might still be there.

75
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:42,302
To save money, they probably
just Iaid the concrete...

76
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:44,459
...for the garage floor
right on top of it.

77
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:48,808
We'II dig straight down. If we hit
the foundation, we stay. If not, we go.

78
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,008
Let's do it.

79
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:56,559
Oh, man.

80
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:06,290
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver
to her temple won't fix.

81
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:14,194
Season 2
Episode 6
Subdivision

82
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:48,250
People die all the time, boys.

83
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:51,684
Five million dollars
comes once in a Iifetime.

84
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,272
-Let me out of here, man. Come on, guys.
-Well, we gotta do something.

85
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:57,388
And it's not gonna involve
hurting anyone.

86
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:04,280
I got an idea.

87
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,407
First, we're gonna need some supplies.

88
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,362
A hundred and 1 0 percent,
I do not agree with this.

89
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,629
Everybody's gotta pitch in
to make this happen.

90
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:32,503
But back in the big house,
the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.

91
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:33,978
Which is why we're doing it here.

92
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,276
If he gets caught in town,
he ain't got a clue where the house is.

93
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:41,509
Besides, you're the one
we can't turn our backs on.

94
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:49,745
I could have died in there, man.

95
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:54,089
Well, guess what.
I need you to do something.

96
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:57,737
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.

97
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,455
Well, we'II talk
once you prove we can trust you.

98
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:02,571
What do I gotta do?

99
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:06,383
I want you to go back to that garden center
and get everything on this Iist.

100
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:09,179
And gas up the car.

101
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:13,607
And we'II meet you right back here
in an hour.

102
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,957
-AII right.
-And, David...

103
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:21,880
...don't screw this up.

104
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:25,195
This ain't Fox River no more, man.

105
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,547
You're Iooking at the real deal now.

106
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:30,954
But I want my cut.

107
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,021
Be back in an hour.

108
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,842
Let's go.

109
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:45,579
Mistake.

110
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:47,904
Big mistake.

111
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,817
Oh, come on, now.

112
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:46,220
Am I glad to see you.

113
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:49,185
You walk here?

114
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,010
No, it's just a Iong story, man.

115
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:55,514
I thought you were meeting up
with your family.

116
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,609
I met a few roadblocks. And you?

117
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:00,713
Yeah.

118
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,393
Well, Iet me guess.
You're going to Tooele.

119
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:05,217
Yeah.

120
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:09,162
Well, Iooks Iike we're going
the same direction.

121
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:11,674
Hopefully, we're not too Iate.

122
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:13,767
Can I hitch a ride?

123
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,066
Hey, Iook...

124
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:22,868
...I'II make it worth your while.

125
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,297
We've got some good news, sir.

126
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:28,832
We got our first tip on Patoshik.

127
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:32,387
Spotted at a burger joint
in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.

128
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:34,245
Hand it over to Iocal
authorities for now.

129
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,962
The only thing we're working today
is Utah and D.B. Cooper.

130
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:38,513
Got it.

131
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,638
Lyle.

132
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,215
There's a guy Iisted as having
the only D.B. Cooper bill ever found.

133
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:46,611
-Harold Jenkins.
-Yeah.

134
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,084
D.B. bought gas from Jenkins...

135
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,421
...with a hundred
on the day of the hijacking.

136
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,105
We checked the serial numbers
and they matched.

137
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:54,444
You worked the case?

138
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,545
Fresh out of the academy
and nobody's cracked it yet.

139
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,259
What makes you think that these escapees
know where the money is?

140
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:04,896
Because they may have been Iocked up
with the real D.B. Cooper.

141
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,950
Jenkins from the gas station,
he still alive?

142
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,870
Should be. He was only 1 8 at the time.

143
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:11,136
Well, Iet's go say hi to him.

144
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:47,057
We're sorry, that call
cannot be completed as dialed.

145
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:49,970
Please check the number and dial again.

146
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,673
Do you have updates on Sara Tancredi?
I assume that's why you're here.

147
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,177
Yes.

148
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,076
Scofield sent her a message
through the mail.

149
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:15,289
A phone number that was disconnected.

150
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:19,198
You know, to be honest...

151
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:22,163
...I was expecting to brief the president.

152
00:12:23,646 --> 00:12:25,773
Yeah, about that.

153
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:30,068
Right now, as you can imagine,
Caroline's quite busy.

154
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:33,429
She's always been busy.
I've been working with her for 1 5 years.

155
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,732
Paul...

156
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:36,905
...she's the president
of the Unites States now.

157
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,322
Yes, Bill and I helped to put her there.

158
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,382
Well, if you'd Iike for her
to remain in office...

159
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:45,723
...you'II take my advice and just stay
on the sidelines for now.

160
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,336
She needs to be completely insulated
from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.

161
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:55,179
I wanna talk to her.

162
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,945
You report to me now, and only me.

163
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,652
Don't try and contact Caroline again
without my approval...

164
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:06,771
...and don't show up here
unannounced.

165
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:12,474
Finish the job you were given.
Get Burrows.

166
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:17,195
If you're telling me the road to him
Ieads through Sara Tancredi, by all means...

167
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,681
...pursue it.

168
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:22,479
And once that's been accomplished
and this whole thing goes away...

169
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:25,921
...we'II go about transitioning you back
into Caroline's Iife.

170
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,789
Now, do you have anything else on Sara?

171
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,745
The president
has unwavering faith in you.

172
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,849
She wants you to go through
Senate approval...

173
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,162
...with your eyes wide open.

174
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,247
-So what are we up against?
-Key allies in the House and Senate...

175
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,152
...are Meyerhoff,
Barnwell and Sommerville.

176
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,173
-Counting on them to sway the middle.
-Who's the opposition?

177
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:47,512
Senators BIake and Killoren
have openly vocalized...

178
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:49,311
...their opposition to you as VP.

179
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:51,465
Any indication as to why?

180
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,077
Political payback for the president's vote
on the energy bill Iast month.

181
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,627
Took them by surprise
and they don't Iike surprises.

182
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:05,847
-Dad. Lance, this is my father, Frank.
-PIeasure to meet you, sir.

183
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:07,930
It's nothing to Iose sleep over.

184
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:10,693
Frankly, the biggest issue
we have to address...

185
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,241
...are the charges facing your daughter.

186
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,642
Governor, are you with me?

187
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:18,188
Absolutely.

188
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,474
Yo, just chill, dog. Listen...

189
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:39,390
...once we roll out, we bounce out of town,
we'II drop a dime and they'II find you.

190
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,257
Just be quiet. Just chill, man.

191
00:14:57,534 --> 00:14:59,331
Woody?

192
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:03,795
Where you at? Woody?

193
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,716
I need Sheriff Williams.

194
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,965
Yeah, I'II hold.

195
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:32,483
Woody?

196
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:49,750
Where'd you Iearn about electricity?

197
00:15:49,854 --> 00:15:52,584
I used to steal copper wiring
from transformer boxes.

198
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:55,129
Then I'd sell them on the docks,
make a few bucks.

199
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:57,883
You were in school, of course.

200
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:10,894
I was just Iooking, pretty.
What's that old chestnut?

201
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:13,740
I can Iook at the menu,
doesn't mean I'm gonna eat.

202
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,418
We get in, we get the money,
we get out.

203
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:19,379
-That's it.
-No, absolutely.

204
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:30,154
We're good.

205
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:35,546
Now, it's just up to the kid.

206
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:44,295
-Did you get everything?
-Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

207
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:06,954
-What?
-Nothing. It's cool. I handled it.

208
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:10,273
-What?
-Whoa. Okay.

209
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,316
Check it. This fool came in the shop.

210
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,621
He was acting all shady,
he got a bad vibe...

211
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,305
...so he picked up his cellie phone,
he started to make a call, so I popped him.

212
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:21,157
-What?!
-I hit him with the shovel, man.

213
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:22,941
I didn't know what else to do.

214
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,735
I tied him up and I put him in the back room
with that other country hick.

215
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,742
-Here we go. Here we go.
-I came through, you gimp.

216
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:33,482
-Who was he calling?
-The sheriff.

217
00:17:33,534 --> 00:17:36,867
Man, I don't know, dude.
It just set off so quick.

218
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:39,328
-Did the call go through?
-Maybe, man. I don't know.

219
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,914
Maybe? Did the call go through?

220
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:44,480
Yes, I-- No, I don't know.
I don't know, man.

221
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:49,647
Yo, but I got the gear.

222
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:51,853
We gotta move on this now.

223
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:54,597
Yes?

224
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:58,305
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?

225
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,980
Excuse me.
I'm Iooking for a Harold Jenkins.

226
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:02,954
Right here.

227
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,431
AIexander Mahone, FBI.

228
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,729
I'm staying 50 feet
away from her at all times.

229
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:09,706
What the hell else does she want?

230
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,485
I'm not here about that.

231
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,236
-What are you here for?
-D.B. Cooper.

232
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,125
People still wanna know about that guy?

233
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:18,875
Unbelievable.

234
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:22,516
You worked the gas station
in American Fork where he filled up.

235
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,718
Yeah. Normal-Iooking guy.
Barely said a word.

236
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:30,381
There were some discrepancies
in the statement you filed 30 years ago.

237
00:18:30,398 --> 00:18:33,925
In the report, it's noted that you said
he filled up at 7 a.m...

238
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:37,699
...but on another occasion,
you said it was 7 p.m.

239
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:40,752
-Which was it?
-Both.

240
00:18:41,278 --> 00:18:42,711
He gassed up twice?

241
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:44,543
Yeah.

242
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:46,833
Full tanks both times?

243
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:50,255
Yeah. Why?

244
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:52,553
A systems what?

245
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:55,038
It's a systems diagnostics test.

246
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:57,229
Footage from our gopher cam
picked up exactly...

247
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,834
...where your Iine was corrupted.

248
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:00,933
And who corrupted it?

249
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:03,456
-You guys?
-Maybe.

250
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,612
AII I know is my supervisor called
and said he wants me and my crew...

251
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:09,817
...to get over here and fix that problem
double quick, double time.

252
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:16,510
-So you're not with the electric company?
-No, ma'am.

253
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,671
Now, feel free to call your company.

254
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,150
But I tell you,
all they'II do is send over some tech.

255
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:22,647
Maybe tomorrow, if you're Iucky.

256
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,563
And he'II spend a whole day
trying to find the problem...

257
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,326
...and another day trying to fix it.

258
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,002
But we're here right now.

259
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,293
And we're ready
to turn your juice back on.

260
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:36,050
My juice?

261
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:38,149
That's right.

262
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:41,072
And...

263
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:45,567
...that's your crew?

264
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:50,772
Yes, ma'am.

265
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,269
Yeah, D.B. Cooper
was driving a 1 965 Chevy Nova.

266
00:19:54,942 --> 00:19:57,308
There's no record on file
that Cooper even had a car.

267
00:19:57,373 --> 00:20:00,137
But Charles Westmoreland did
and the car registered to him...

268
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,717
...at the time was a 1 965 Chevy Nova
with a 1 6-gallon gas tank.

269
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:07,404
Back then, a Chevy that size got
approximately eight miles to the gallon.

270
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:11,582
D.B. stopped at the station in American Fork
and gassed up once early that day...

271
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:14,847
...and then came back Iater that same night
and gassed up again.

272
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:18,370
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico,
which is a straight shot south...

273
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:20,592
...drive off the main road
for an all-day detour?

274
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:21,897
-The money.
-Exactly.

275
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:25,916
Cooper, Westmoreland,
jumped out of a plane with $5 million.

276
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,295
But Westmoreland didn't have the money
on him when he was arrested.

277
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:33,201
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that magic marker.

278
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:35,543
From American Fork,
he couldn't have gone further...

279
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:37,138
...than 64 miles in any direction.

280
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:39,406
I want everything you've got
in that perimeter.

281
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,454
Those cons are in one of these towns...

282
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:45,128
...and if there's so much as a cat missing
in one of them, I wanna know about it.

283
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:51,335
The defective cable runs
right beneath your garage.

284
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:54,191
We're gonna have to dig up the floor
to get to it.

285
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,978
Well, who's gonna pay for this...

286
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:59,520
...and what about the cleanup
and the repair?

287
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:02,574
Well, the company will cover all costs.

288
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:04,055
We'II just dig a small trench.

289
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:07,855
Once we're finished, we'II re-Iay
the cement. It'II Iook as good as new.

290
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,838
How Iong is it gonna take?

291
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:12,751
One way or another,
we'II be out of here today.

292
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:15,874
Really need to get started, ma'am.

293
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,492
Wouldn't want a pretty Iittle thing
Iike yourself sitting...

294
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,144
...in the dark tonight, now, would we?

295
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:26,164
Well, that depends
on who I'm sitting with.

296
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:28,298
Touche.

297
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:35,678
Fine. It's okay, y'all go ahead
and do whatever y'all need to do.

298
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:38,476
Jeanette, the noise might be substantial.

299
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:41,050
You might wanna take
in that tennis game after all.

300
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:43,746
Oh, no, it's too hot for that now.

301
00:21:44,158 --> 00:21:48,733
PIus, I gotta keep an eye on you all
and make sure you don't steal anything.

302
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,360
Ma'am.

303
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,186
-How are you?
-Good.

304
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:00,329
AII right, where's Tweener?

305
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:02,505
He's next door
plugging in the extension cord.

306
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:07,582
-We're gonna have to cut up the cement.
-Yo, we gots company.

307
00:22:12,702 --> 00:22:14,829
What's up, snowflake?

308
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:23,354
Well, as always, your timing is flawless.

309
00:22:24,524 --> 00:22:27,186
-I don't follow.
-Well, Iet me try to explain it to you.

310
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:28,904
We're trying to run something here...

311
00:22:29,003 --> 00:22:31,801
...and we can't have people
walking in off the street.

312
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:36,957
Oh, okay, so you want us to Ieave
and then you can just mail us the check?

313
00:22:38,476 --> 00:22:40,876
Sucre, I know you trust me...

314
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:43,203
...and you know I'II cut you in
on that money.

315
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:46,575
But the two of you being here right now
jeopardizes everything.

316
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:49,813
I'm not going nowhere.

317
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,527
I want my share of the money.

318
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:54,961
Wait a minute, hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?

319
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:57,615
You know, I say I want in, you say no...

320
00:22:58,219 --> 00:23:01,347
...then I threaten to tell somebody
about what's going on here.

321
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,883
And then you decide to play nice
and then we're one big happy family.

322
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:09,980
Why don't we just stop wasting time,
all right?

323
00:23:15,116 --> 00:23:16,947
Thank you.

324
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:26,004
Damn, man, you still alive?

325
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,401
And kicking, homeboy.

326
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:30,882
How'd you find us?

327
00:23:30,988 --> 00:23:34,185
Man, if I can do rapid deployment
of satellite communications...

328
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,984
...for Uncle Sam all over the world--

329
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:38,833
How are you guys doing?

330
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:42,493
Who are you? Who are they?

331
00:23:43,148 --> 00:23:45,480
I had to call my supervisor.

332
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:48,346
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority.

333
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:51,956
They want to get this done as quickly
and as efficiently as possible.

334
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,093
Well, Jeanette, Iike I said,
there's a Iot of work to do...

335
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:07,521
...and it's gonna be noisy.

336
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:10,358
Oh, drinks. I forgot to ask.

337
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:12,320
We're good. Thanks.

338
00:24:22,091 --> 00:24:23,683
Yo, man, this is not good.

339
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,163
We got her up in our grill
checking in on us all the time.

340
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,045
The boy is right.

341
00:24:30,123 --> 00:24:35,026
And since I can't dig,
I'II volunteer to keep her occupied.

342
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:37,472
You don't touch her.

343
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,445
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?

344
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:41,931
I know how to play nice.

345
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:44,054
I'II be watching.

346
00:25:33,835 --> 00:25:37,293
Billy? Is that you?

347
00:25:44,524 --> 00:25:46,788
Billy, is that you?

348
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:52,853
Yeah.

349
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,051
Thank you kindly.

350
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:07,500
Well, now,
how did you get out of working?

351
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,651
Union rules.

352
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,141
One crew member
always has to supervise.

353
00:26:13,164 --> 00:26:16,395
I'II check on them in a bit.

354
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,405
Lemonade?

355
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:28,796
Little more ice?

356
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:34,397
Yeah.

357
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:40,535
And I Iike mine with a Iittle oomph.

358
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:42,649
But since you're on the clock...

359
00:26:42,732 --> 00:26:48,364
...I guess you can't join me?

360
00:26:49,835 --> 00:26:51,530
Just two fingers.

361
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:57,057
AII right.

362
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:15,936
It's been a while.

363
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:17,874
Yeah?

364
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,569
Whiskey always makes me feel irascible.

365
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:30,867
I don't know what that means.

366
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:34,994
But I do Iike the sound of it.

367
00:27:39,755 --> 00:27:42,223
Are you wearing Angel perfume?

368
00:27:43,947 --> 00:27:46,211
I am.

369
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:56,335
That reminds you of an ex, I take it.

370
00:27:56,363 --> 00:27:58,228
Yeah.

371
00:27:59,436 --> 00:28:02,564
Now, is that good memories...

372
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:06,320
...or bad memories?

373
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,185
Both.

374
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:20,359
Did you talk to Maricruz?

375
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,291
I don't wanna talk about her.

376
00:28:23,595 --> 00:28:25,358
I gotta get some water or something.

377
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:28,046
Use the hose on the other side
of the house.

378
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,749
Sucre...

379
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:37,678
...down the road, if you're in trouble,
Europeangoldfinch.net.

380
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:42,584
It's what we can all use to communicate.

381
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,601
Post a note on the message board.

382
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:50,662
-What's it called?
-Europeangoldfinch.net.

383
00:28:50,668 --> 00:28:53,068
That's a bird, right?

384
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,066
I got something.

385
00:29:06,636 --> 00:29:09,571
-It's the silo's foundation.
-Hells, yeah.

386
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,245
Thank you, Charles.

387
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:16,097
We just need to find the edge
and dig underneath it.

388
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:21,197
We'II get the money, hit the back roads.

389
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:25,129
What's wrong?

390
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:29,898
We got to stop in Tooele first
and gas up our ride.

391
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,191
I thought you already did that.

392
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,134
Man, when the garden center thing
happened, I just forgot, all right?

393
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:39,322
I want you to go back into town.

394
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,234
I want you to gas up that car...

395
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:44,520
...because I'm not driving around
with millions of dollars in the trunk.

396
00:29:44,555 --> 00:29:47,149
-Do you understand?
-Man, why do I got to do it?

397
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:49,146
Okay.

398
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:51,432
Okay.

399
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,993
I better check in on our friend.

400
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:08,088
You got it all the time.

401
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:10,639
Miss Tinsel toes.

402
00:30:18,892 --> 00:30:20,757
Billy?

403
00:30:22,732 --> 00:30:24,529
Billy?

404
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:26,263
Yeah?

405
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:28,506
I made you a sandwich.

406
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:31,920
Peanut butter and jelly
with the crusts cut off.

407
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,854
Just Iike you Iike.

408
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,764
I'm so glad you came back.

409
00:30:42,027 --> 00:30:47,727
I don't wanna say I told you so,
but that was just not the girl for you.

410
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:54,148
Where is that?

411
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,210
Where's what, sweetheart?

412
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:59,768
That painting.

413
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:04,672
It's Holland, where I grew up.
You know that.

414
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:09,698
-It's beautiful.
-Oh, there's no place better.

415
00:31:09,707 --> 00:31:12,005
It's so peaceful...

416
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:16,239
...so protected from this crazy world.

417
00:31:29,611 --> 00:31:31,909
-Operator.
-Hello, operator.

418
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:34,038
There's an intruder in my house.

419
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:42,383
Hello, ma 'am? Ma 'am, are you there?

420
00:31:42,955 --> 00:31:44,786
Is anyone there?

421
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,254
Heard you had some activity
in Tooele today.

422
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:53,079
A bit. Don't see how it warrants
a visit from the FBI.

423
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:54,996
A stolen car was dumped
outside of town...

424
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,074
...belonging to a woman from St. Louis.

425
00:31:57,163 --> 00:31:59,757
-Am I getting that right?
-Yes, sir.

426
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:02,549
And then here, the owner's girlfriend
reports him missing...

427
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:07,020
...and then his buddy comes by
to check it out and he goes missing too.

428
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,386
Woody and Chet have been known
to drop everything...

429
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:11,885
...and go boar hunting
when the opportunity arises.

430
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:14,177
And they don't tell their old Iadies.

431
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:21,611
Mr. Mahone, I'II bet you my Iunch money
there's nothing amiss around here.

432
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:27,687
His dad will be showing up soon
with the keys and you can Iook for yourself.

433
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:29,886
Whoa, what are you doing?

434
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:37,921
Mr. Mahone.

435
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:54,711
They're here. Those escaped convicts.
They're here in town.

436
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,103
Who's there?

437
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:29,985
It's the police, ma'am. You okay?

438
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:32,276
Yes.

439
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:36,882
-Can you tell me what happened?
-There was this strange man.

440
00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:41,142
I made him a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

441
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:43,688
I thought he was Billy.

442
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:51,080
And once the kids went to sleep,
we'd take a bath.

443
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:54,833
A Iong bath.

444
00:33:54,891 --> 00:34:00,523
And afterwards, I'd just sit there
and watch her do her routine.

445
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:04,425
She'd rub her Iotion on, comb her hair...

446
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:08,090
...dress up in her nighttime fineries.

447
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:10,632
Oh, you're killing me.

448
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:16,589
She had this spot on her neck
right here.

449
00:34:18,987 --> 00:34:21,820
Gave her goose bumps every time.

450
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:29,644
And that perfume....

451
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:39,182
My ex, he was an accountant.

452
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:41,899
He was really buttoned up.

453
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:46,150
It was wham, bam, thank you, Sam.

454
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:49,833
Well, shame on him.

455
00:34:52,107 --> 00:34:57,568
Why did it end with that Iady
you were talking about?

456
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:05,096
Just went our separate ways.

457
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:16,301
Do you know what I think
the best cure is for a broken heart?

458
00:35:18,123 --> 00:35:20,057
Do tell.

459
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:23,398
Get back on the bike.

460
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,252
Whatever bike it is.

461
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:32,851
Amen to that.

462
00:35:33,322 --> 00:35:34,550
Speaking of...

463
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:39,563
...could you do something for me?

464
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:43,979
I'm certain of it.

465
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:47,854
Come here.

466
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:52,149
Only, you have to be very discreet.

467
00:35:53,995 --> 00:35:56,793
They don't come any discreeter.

468
00:35:56,843 --> 00:36:00,176
You know that big guy?

469
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:05,323
The strong guy that doesn't speak much?

470
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:06,790
Would you go in there...

471
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:09,758
...and ask him if he would Iike
to have a drink with me...

472
00:36:09,802 --> 00:36:11,963
...after he punches out?

473
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:14,513
PIease.

474
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:18,741
You've just been playing me
this whole time, haven't you?

475
00:36:18,794 --> 00:36:20,728
Come on.

476
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:22,310
Don't be Iike that.

477
00:36:23,435 --> 00:36:25,630
Would you just go in
and ask your friend?

478
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:27,607
PIease.

479
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:50,106
-Hey, Dad.
-Sara, I've been trying to reach you.

480
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:53,714
Uh, yeah, I've been meeting
with my defense attorneys all day.

481
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:55,764
-You in Washington?
-Yeah, I'm coming back...

482
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:57,580
...on the next flight.

483
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:00,610
-I thought you're gonna be there for a while.
-No, plan's changed.

484
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:04,280
Sara, you remember that guy that I met
with you in your apartment?

485
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:06,062
I want you to stay away from him.

486
00:37:06,187 --> 00:37:08,451
Who, Lance from my group?

487
00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:11,151
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.

488
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:13,441
I found out some other things too.

489
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:16,278
-What are you talking about?
-You were right.

490
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:19,831
-Sara?
-I gotta go.

491
00:37:28,587 --> 00:37:31,055
Yeah, that's right.

492
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,390
Yeah.

493
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:38,978
-Yo.
-Just one second, sir.

494
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:41,411
Thank you.

495
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:44,577
-Can I help you?
-Just put 40 on three.

496
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:46,966
I'm sorry, what pump was that?

497
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:49,491
-Three.
-That one's been sticking.

498
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:52,804
-Okay. Then, I'II move the car.
-No. No, don't trouble yourself.

499
00:37:52,843 --> 00:37:55,311
I'II have the mechanic come out
and pump it for you.

500
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:57,339
I've got a customer waiting on three.

501
00:37:57,419 --> 00:38:00,286
-AII right, I'II be right there.
-I'm in a hurry, all right?

502
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:02,424
Oh, he'II be right out.
Just one second.

503
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:08,644
Put your hands behind your head
and drop to your knees.

504
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:11,848
-Oh, God.
-Drop!

505
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:15,264
Where are they?

506
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:19,716
What? What?

507
00:39:21,354 --> 00:39:25,256
Where are they?

508
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:30,671
Hey, man, one hand or not, I think
hillbilly needs to be up in here digging.

509
00:39:30,698 --> 00:39:32,632
What you think?

510
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,153
Good man.

511
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:03,287
What the hell are you doing up here?

512
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:05,737
I'm sorry, Jeanette.

513
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,397
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.

514
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:10,324
-I apologize for barging in.
-Don't bother.

515
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:13,355
She's got the hots for the big strong one.

516
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:15,819
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
We're gonna get back to work now.

517
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:17,179
No, I think y'all are done.

518
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,123
And I think y'all need to Ieave now.

519
00:40:20,778 --> 00:40:22,143
We're almost finished.

520
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:25,778

00:40:45,674 --> 00:40:47,335
Cop.

523
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,278
Oh, thank God.

524

-Where you going?
-T-Bag, Iet her go!

525

Oh, God.

526

She's our only way out of this, pretty.

527
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:11,483
Don't say a word, you old whore,
