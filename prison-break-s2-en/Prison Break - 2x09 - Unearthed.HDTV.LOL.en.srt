<i>Previously, on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:03,080
Excuse me,
I need to ask you a few questions.

3
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:04,554
And then that dirty southerner,

4
00:00:05,217 --> 00:00:06,394
he snuck out the back.

5
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:09,231
Do you really think
the diaper sniper got all of it?

6
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:10,239
If you were Bagwell,

7
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:12,335
and you just got your hands
on $5 million,

8
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:13,991
where would you go?

9
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,400
All right, listen,

10
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,562
<i>in the Rainbow Room.</i>

11
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,809
Restaurant in New York city.

12
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:19,448
I am gonna be waiting

13
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:20,909
in that spot.

14
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:22,886
<i>And that's all that I want...</i>

15
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:24,773
<i>in this whole world,</i>

16
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,938
is for my two girls
to be waiting there for me.

17
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,144
Three dots, third letter.

18
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:43,930
Question is "where"?

19
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:47,552
What? What are you trying
to tell me, Michael?

20
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,835
I think I owe you an apology.

21
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,558
Because I lied to you.

22
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:54,258
About Oscar Shales.

23
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:56,864
Right there.

24
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,516
That's where I put the bullet in him.

25
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:02,482
What are you doing, man?

26
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:05,382
You've been hired to do a job.

27
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:06,777
The reasoning...

28
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,433
does not concern you.

29
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:10,128
You don't ask any questions about us,

30
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:13,004
maybe we'll continue to make sure
no one asks any questions about you.

31
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:14,102
Are we clear?

32
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:17,790
They all die.

33
00:01:51,406 --> 00:01:52,485
Hey.

34
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,373
Hey.

35
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:55,766
Are you new?

36
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:58,231
Yeah.

37
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,494
No one told me we were getting
a new volunteer.

38
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:02,574
I've been working, uh,

39
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,865
night shifts, cleanup and...

40
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,434
Jimmy said I could change
my shift, so...

41
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,476
You know what you're doing?

42
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:11,900
Yeah.

43
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:13,942
I'll see you around.

44
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:15,155
Right.

45
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,191
This might be Scofield.

46
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:17,374
<i>Copy that.</i>

47
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,387
You take that side.

48
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,104
Freeze!

49
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:29,442
Take it easy, man.

50
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:31,657
- Stay on the ground!
- What's the deal?

51
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,122
He's gone.

52
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:40,836
How you feeling?

53
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,858
Okay, I guess.

54
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:44,499
Tired.

55
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:48,370
I'm a target, kid.

56
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,140
As long as you're with me, so are you.

57
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:54,265
Things could get a lot worse
before they get better.

58
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:55,363
You understand?

59
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,734
But after we meet up with uncle Mike
and get to Panama...

60
00:04:57,753 --> 00:04:58,918
Panama ain't a sure thing,

61
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:00,459
Your uncle's plan is dangerous.

62
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:01,749
I mean really dangerous.

63
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:04,853
Listen...

64
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:08,162
all the charges against you
have been dropped;

65
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:10,339
you're free and clear
to start a new life.

66
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,591
A good life.

67
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:12,997
Not be constantly running,

68
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:15,555
- looking over your shoulder...
- You want me to leave?

69
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,311
No.

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,620
No.

71
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,625
Good, 'cause I'm not.

72
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,449
Turn the sound up on the tube, Jenny.

73
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:44,450
<i>Do you have any thoughts
on the death of David Apolskis?</i>

74
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:47,544
<i>It was unfortunate.</i>

75
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:49,853
<i>- Tests show he was shot at close range.
- Oh, David.</i>**

76
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,659
<i>Was there any opportunity
to subdue him...</i>

77
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:54,258
let me remind you that despite his age,
David "Tweener" Apolskis

78
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:57,067
was a fugitive who made a move
for my weapon.

79
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,388
I did not want to have to kill him,

80
00:06:00,646 --> 00:06:03,381
but sometimes, things happen
that are just out of your control.

81
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:05,886
That good ole boy's hunting 'em all
down, ain't he?

82
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:08,277
<i>Mr. Mahone, sources claim
that you've recovered Scofield's</i>

83
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,685
<i>hard drive and have obtained
substantial data from it.</i>

84
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:11,747
What sources?

85
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:14,097
<i>Allegedly you've retrieved information
detailing not only</i>

86
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:16,578
how he broke out, but how he plans
to stay out. Comments?

87
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:17,610
No.

88
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:19,995
<i>The event at Blanding
Botanical Gardens earlier today,</i>

89
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:22,547
that was a result of hard-drive data
you collected.

90
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:24,779
No comment.

91
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:27,590
<i>You found other locations
where Scofield might be headed?</i>

92
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,313
<i>- True?
- I believe I said no comment.</i>

93
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:30,759
<i>There's something about this guy,</i>

94
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:33,417
<i>it's like he knows where we're going,
what we're thinking.</i>

95
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,173
<i>Mr. Mahone, could you tell us
where you're headed next?</i>

96
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:38,418
<i>What role will the hard drive
play in your search?</i>

97
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,174
Heard it came back
from the lab, any findings?

98
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:47,047
Yeah, 3,200 nitroglycerine ampules.

99
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:50,554
Scofield knew these needed
to be stored in a cool, moist area.

100
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:54,117
Best place for that in the Utah desert
is the botanical gardens.

101
00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:55,118
It's stable?

102
00:06:55,176 --> 00:06:58,178
All medical grade, safely used
by heart patients all the time.

103
00:06:58,255 --> 00:06:59,802
But in the aggregate...

104
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,486
it could take out an entire building.

105
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:02,854
That box right there.

106
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:06,406
This is why we can't have...

107
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:08,448
leaks...

108
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,072
coming from this office.

109
00:07:11,862 --> 00:07:14,465
God help the agent
who goes behind my back

110
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,526
and talks to the press.

111
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:28,388
<i>Can you elaborate on
any of your tactics in this manhunt?</i>

112
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:31,591

that if you know your enemy,</i>

113
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,183
<i>you need not fear a hundred battles.</i>

114
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,377
<i>I know these men...</i>

115
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:35,871

<i>where they want to go.</i>

117
00:07:41,388 --> 00:07:42,467
<i>These convicts,</i>

118
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:45,211
<i>are in an constant battle.</i>

119
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:47,927
<i>Not only with me,</i>

120
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:50,454

00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:06,122
<i>Stay, or go?</i>

<i>My job is to know
how they answer these questions.</i>

126
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,758
The only way to win a war
is to try to know your prey completely

127
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:18,677
and then you get to go after your enemy
with everything you've got.

129
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:58,305
Our half-priced stuff is in the back.

130
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:00,815
I'm looking for something very specific.

131
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:02,318
Okay.

132
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:08,108
This is it.

133
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,659
This is exactly what I need.

134
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,010
Great.

135
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,626
We were just inches away today,

136
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,815
inches.

137
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:20,127
I want these blown up, huge.

138
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,377
- Put them in my office on the walls.
- What are these?

139
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:23,740
Somewhere in there is information

140
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,780
regarding a rendezvous
that Scofield set up,

141
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:27,769
and we're going
to crack that code today. Lang!

142
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:29,357
Today's the day Franklin told his wife

143
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:31,148
he's going to meet her
at the Rainbow Room.

144
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,608
- Right.
- Wrong. Today's the day

145
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,184
Franklin's going down. Are you ready?

146
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:35,552
Everything's arranged.

147
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,089
It's all here?

148
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:06,238
Hey, yo, Tray, wassup, big?

149
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,082
I know that ain't you.

150
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,469
Ain't a ghost, man.

151
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:12,648
You holding up all right?

152
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:15,974
Yeah. Caught a whole bunch of buses
just to get here to Chi-town, man.

153
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:17,781
How you think I'm supposed to feel?

154
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,477
Chris. Jay.

155
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:22,870
Wassup, Flam?
You look like you lost a few, bro.

156
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:24,160
Slim-fast, baby.

157
00:10:24,218 --> 00:10:25,412
Is that what it is?

158
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,782
The Feds been
in your old lady's business, no joke.

159
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:28,949
Up in your crib,

160
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:31,665
- and following her around sometimes.
- Yeah, I know, man. I know.

161
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:32,887
Yo, I know you love Kacee,

162
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:35,804
but I don't know if it's a good idea
for you to be coming around here.

163
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:36,928
You're a wanted man.

164
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:38,949
I'm wanted because I kept my mouth shut,

165
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:40,450
and I kept you out of Fox River.

166
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:41,892
See, man, we feel that,

167
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,337
and we owe you one.

168
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:46,440
Good, 'cause I'm collecting right now.

169
00:10:47,736 --> 00:10:49,183
My wife is waiting for me today,

170
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,298
and I am not leaving Chi-town
without my family.

171
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:52,415
You understand?

172
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:53,822
Now, y'all going to help me.

173
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:55,498
Let's roll out.

174
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:10,752
Where you going?

175
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:15,029
Take my kid to school.

176
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:17,459
I know about the Rainbow Room.

177
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:19,115
I don't know what you're talking about.

178
00:11:19,154 --> 00:11:20,502
Phone lines are tapped.

179
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,262
We heard your entire telephone
conversation with your husband.

180
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:25,897
And, since you and Dede aren't booked
on any flights to New York,

181
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,671
don't tell me the Rainbow Room
is a restaurant in Manhattan.

182
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:31,199
Now, you can tell me
where you're meeting your husband,

183
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:32,475
or I can arrest you

184
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:34,260
right in front of your daughter.

185
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:36,852
You go to hell.

186
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,731
I haven't done anything wrong.

187
00:11:41,057 --> 00:11:44,015
You spoke with an escaped felon
about meeting him today.

188
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,885
You've already done enough to be charged
with attempt to aid and abet.

189
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,175
Please, okay?

190
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,522
- Listen to me.
- One phone call

191
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,870
and child welfare is here,

192
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,336
and you're going to county
and Dede will be in foster care.

193
00:11:54,374 --> 00:11:55,339
- No.
- Don't worry.

194
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:58,633
I hear the families
in the foster system are top-notch.

195
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:06,050
You are asking me to choose

196
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,472
between my daughter and my husband.

197
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:11,149
Exactly.

198
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:13,448
Anything?

199
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:16,211
I'm on the phone with Fox River,
Checking T-bag's file.

200
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:18,679
Hey, what you got for me?

201
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:21,792
Really?

202
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:24,011
52 times?

203
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:26,091
Where?

204
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,421
I owe you, Patterson.

205
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:34,235
We got a lot of road to cover.

206
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:55,817
We're good?

207
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,673
No more stops
until we get to New Mexico.

208
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,399
- You forgot your change.
- Yeah.

209
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,559
- Thanks.
- You were in such a rush.

210
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:12,753
Thanks.

211
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:17,755
Keep walking.

212
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,277
Keep walking.

213
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,415
Come on, keep walking.

214
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,411
Damn it.

215
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,448
You don't have to ditch the car.
We can keep driving.

216
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,512
Can't. The waitress made me
and the car. It's useless.

217
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:44,902
Sorry, you know.

218
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:46,619
Maybe we can find another car.

219
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:48,689
Cars ain't exactly
growing on trees out here.

220
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:51,303
We've got 400 miles to go
and no way of getting there.

221
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,127
We don't get to Michael in time,
he's going to leave without us.

222
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:55,841
Uncle Mike wouldn't do that.

223
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:58,629
He doesn't have a choice.
It's a one-shot deal out of the country.

224
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:00,189
I said I was sorry.

225
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,724
There was a sign
back there for a train station.

226
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:05,707
- It ain't that easy.
- We'll follow the road...

227
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:07,498
- It ain't that easy.
- We won't be seen.

228
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:09,910
Hey, I'm not an idiot.

229
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,323
I was on the run, too, you know.

230
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:16,662
Yeah, you were on the run
and you got caught.

231
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:22,028
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I'm not a pro
at being a con like you, dad.

232
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:25,120
Maybe I should have just left
when you gave me the out, huh?

233
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:27,152
It's not like you care.

234
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,773
Take it easy.

235
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,174
I'm sorry, all right?

236
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,347
Sorry, I'm just...

237
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:47,666
Let's get out of here.

238
00:14:59,282 --> 00:15:01,732
Mrs. Pamela Mahone?

239
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,870
- Yes?
- Agent Wayne Merrick, F.B.I.

240
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:07,127
I'd like to talk to you
about your husband.

241
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,944
I'm surprised...

242
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:18,866
that you're coming to me
for a background check on Alex.

243
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:20,099
It's standard procedure.

244
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:21,229
We run these kind of checks

245
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:23,323
when an agent
is about to be promoted to a,

246
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:24,875
to a higher security clearance.

247
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:26,012
No, I know that.

248
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:28,031
I did this dance
the last time he was promoted.

249
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,265
I just figured that
since we were divorced...

250
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:33,580
I mean, I rarely speak to him
and I certainly don't follow his career.

251
00:15:33,654 --> 00:15:35,381
I really need to get this done today,

252
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,724
so... I promise I won't take up
much of your time.

253
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:42,795
I've given enough time
to my ex-husband, Mr. Merrick.

254
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:44,971
I see.

255
00:15:45,283 --> 00:15:46,516
The...

256
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,577
The bureau can take
its toll on your family.

257
00:15:50,193 --> 00:15:51,503
I understand that.

258
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,360
My ex-wife is a...

259
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,764
An agent and...

260
00:15:57,016 --> 00:15:58,675
let's just say I know how you feel.

261
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:06,282
Promise me that he won't find out
we spoke?

262
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,669
Oh, it's totally confidential.

263
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:09,989
Do you mind if I ask why?

264
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,638
To be perfectly honest,

265
00:16:12,495 --> 00:16:13,574
he scares me.

266
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:49,528
<i>Information.</i>

267
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:51,740
Hi, I need the number
for a Sundown hotel please.

268
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:52,831
What state?

269
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:55,701
- All of them, please.
- Got one in Pierre, South Dakota.

270
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:58,126
- Ay.
- Another in Sutton, West Virginia

271
00:16:58,248 --> 00:16:59,750
and one more in Gila, New Mexico.

272
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:37,791
What can I do you for?

273
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,494
A batch of them sunflowers, please.

274
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:40,900
You don't mind me

275
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,130
saying, you do not sound
like you hail from Kansas.

276
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:44,589
You've got a sharp ear.

277
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:46,730
I hail from what we call the,

278
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:48,666
yellowhammer state.

279
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,347
What brings you to Tribune?

280
00:17:58,157 --> 00:17:59,197
Sir?

281
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:01,725
Romance.

282
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:06,356
Thank you so much.

283
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:14,579
Somebody's going to get hurt.

284
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:17,277
Feds going to be swinging bigger bats
than these.

285
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:18,647
We gotta have ours.

286
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:21,980
Look, man, that's all we need
is your car, your truck,

287
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:23,505
and some guts, man.

288
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,853
We don't need all of this.

289
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,226
- Maybe we should think about it.
- I said no!

290
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:31,698
What's going to happen, man,
when the bullets start flying,

291
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,223
<i>Can you guarantee me that my family
ain't going to get hurt?</i>

292
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,931
Johnny law is going to strapped up.
I'm going in hot.

293
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,542
I don't think you heard me, little man.

294
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,120
No, I don't think you heard me, Bruh.

295
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:41,507
I'm not going in naked.

296
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,352
I know we said
we'd ride with you on this,

297
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:46,845
but I'm not going in there
without some of these.

298
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:58,093
You want to punk out, man?

299
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,422
Then punk out,

300
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,002
'cause I can do this myself.

301
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:05,619
Ain't nobody punking out.

302
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,389
And no guns.

303
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:16,709
But you'd better be right about this
'cause if bullets do start flying,

304
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:19,031
the only blood being spilled
is going to be ours.

305
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,937
Feel me?

306
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:24,043
I feel you.

307
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,022
Agent Kellerman.

308
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:29,651
Agent Kellerman!

309
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:30,671
Yes.

310
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:32,711
That name you wanted me
to track, Kelli Foster.

311
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,038
She booked a flight to New Mexico,
just landed.

312
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:37,174
You got someone on it?

313
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:39,234
No, but we got an ID on her rental car.

314
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,914
Should I update Mr. Kim?

315
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:43,254
No, I'll take care of this myself.

316
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,426
Got a tip from a waitress
who thinks she saw Burrows

317
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:51,371
and his son outside St. David, Arizona.

318
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,141
get a road team out there to confirm.

319
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:56,087
Once they got a bead on Burrows,
notify me immediately.

320
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:57,770
Everybody out! Let's go, come on!

321
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:04,342
Yeah?

322
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:07,308
Sara Tancredi just booked
a one-way ticket across the country.

323
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,819
- To where?
<i>- New Mexico.</i>

324
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,082
Of course.

325
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,347
Any luck breaking that code?

326
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:19,865
- This helps.
- Good.

327
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,175
Wheeler!

328
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:31,224
Sir.

329
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:33,500
Every combination that has "nm" in it.

330
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,555
I want you to check it

331
00:20:34,594 --> 00:20:37,606
to see if it contains
the name of a location in New Mexico.

332
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:40,324
- And I want it done now. Right now.
- Now, you got it.

333
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:44,450
So, how well do you know Alex?

334
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:46,555
He knows me better than I know him.

335
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,546
He's a closed book, all right.

336
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:50,609
But he wasn't always like that.

337
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,411
In the first few years of our marriage,

338
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:57,925
he was actually... romantic.

339
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:01,811
And then,

340
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:05,135
one day, out of nowhere...

341
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:09,263
Out of nowhere what?

342
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:11,690
Everything changed.

343
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:14,985
He became obsessed with getting out.

344
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:16,618
Out of the marriage?

345
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,069
Getting out of the marriage,

346
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:20,020
getting me out of the house,

347
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,311
out of his life.

348
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:22,659
He left me.

349
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:25,456
He left the both of us.

350
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,163
You said you were scared of him.

351
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,761
Why is that?

352
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:34,102
He started acting strange.

353
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:37,613
Started spending all of his time
in the backyard gardening,

354
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,867
of all things. I mean,
the man was a neat freak.

355
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,534
He'd throw away a pair of shoes
if they even got scuffed.

356
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:44,988
But he'd be out there

357
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:46,048
all covered in dirt

358
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:49,472
and surrounded by these huge bags
of fertilizer and lye.

359
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:53,014
We'd just put this new sod in

360
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,884
and he just tore it all up
and planted a flower bed.

361
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:58,627
And I went out back once to talk to him

362
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:01,900
and he screamed at me

363
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:05,792
and said not to come near the garden.

364
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:07,929
Said that it was his.

365
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,935
I'm sorry. If you...

366
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,050
If you wanna take a break...

367
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,252
All I wanted was an explanation.

368
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:20,450
Why things ended so suddenly.

369
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:23,388
And all Alex could say was:

370
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,780
"Sometimes, things happen"

371
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,076
"that are just out of your control."

372
00:22:54,835 --> 00:22:56,794
So the picture
in your daughter's bedroom,

373
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:58,946
the exact location where it was taken

374
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:00,601
was a merry-go-round, right?

375
00:23:01,502 --> 00:23:02,508
Yeah.

376
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:05,193
So, all you have to do
is wait by the merry-go-round.

377
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:07,469
Right where Benjamin's expecting you.

378
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:11,995
Is that necessary?

379
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:14,677
- I mean, Benjamin's not..
- It's precautionary.

380
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:19,501
Look, I do this,

381
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:23,284
you leave me and my child alone.

382
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,241
You have my word.

383
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:49,578
Is my wife there?

384
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:52,623
<i>- Yeah, she's here.
- Well, let's go get her.</i>

385
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:07,358
<i>73, ready at position n°1.</i>

386
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,911
In 15 seconds,

387
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,704
a black Jeep is going to pull up
by the parking lot's entrance.

388
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,138
Run to it.

389
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,297
Chris?

390
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:35,181
Go!

391
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:36,988
I can't.

392
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,835
They're gonna take Dede.

393
00:24:38,932 --> 00:24:39,994
Look, no, they won't.

394
00:24:40,635 --> 00:24:41,932
Is that guy talking to her?

395
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:42,732
Get a read on him.

396
00:24:42,754 --> 00:24:43,650
<i>Move to position.</i>

397
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:45,360
It's taken care of. Go!

398
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:51,925
Go!

399
00:24:58,218 --> 00:25:01,351
She's running! She's running!
Go, go, go, go! Move, move!

400
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,654
Get in!

401
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:14,099
Hold on!

402
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:27,712
It's a 2007 black Jeep.

403
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:29,143
License plates have been removed.

404
00:25:29,212 --> 00:25:30,869
We're in pursuit, headed... No!

405
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:40,320
Move the truck.

406
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:42,362
Move the truck!

407
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:44,092
I said move it!

408
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,096
Where is my child?

409
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:52,599
Here.

410
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,463
- Dede?
- Hey, it's me, baby.

411
00:25:57,235 --> 00:25:58,725
Look, I just want to tell you

412
00:25:59,428 --> 00:26:01,083
that everything is going to be okay.

413
00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:03,601
We're gonna be a family again.
I promise you that.

414
00:26:03,656 --> 00:26:06,042
Where is Dede? He said that you had her!

415
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:07,408
No, no. Be easy, baby.

416
00:26:07,918 --> 00:26:08,925
Easy.

417
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,083
Darius is picking her up
from school right now.

418
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:15,388
Dede Franklin, Dawson elementary.

419
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,140
I want her pulled from school now!

420
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,654
<i>What the hell is going on, man?</i>

421
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:21,199
They say she's taking a test, man,

422
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:22,681
but I think they're stalling.

423
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:28,824
What about...

424
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:30,888
What about Oscar Shales?

425
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:33,026
Oscar Shales?

426
00:26:33,498 --> 00:26:34,726
Why is he important?

427
00:26:38,345 --> 00:26:39,448
Well, he's...

428
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:43,091
He's just the only fugitive
to ever successfully elude your...

429
00:26:43,974 --> 00:26:45,022
Your ex-husband.

430
00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:48,434
Alex was consumed with finding him.

431
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:50,754
I mean, after what Shales did
to all of his victims,

432
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:51,871
who could blame him?

433
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:55,337
It was all he worked on,
all he did for a year.

434
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,792
But I don't think that it was the stress
of chasing Shales

435
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:00,960
that caused Alex
to start behaving erratically.

436
00:27:01,512 --> 00:27:02,516
Why is that?

437
00:27:02,895 --> 00:27:05,650
Because Alex changed
after the trail went cold.

438
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:08,826
I remember it like it was yesterday.
He just...

439
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:10,929
walked into the kitchen,

440
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:13,408
after 12 years of marriage,

441
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:17,511
and says that he wanted me
out of the house immediately.

442
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,242
I'll never forget the date.

443
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:22,703
It was june 15.

444
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:27,178
I think I have everything I need.

445
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:29,005
But you didn't even ask about

446
00:27:29,074 --> 00:27:30,943
social history or education?

447
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:32,586
That's standard in these checks.

448
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:33,455
That's been handled.

449
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:37,812
I have to get these reports filed
with Strategic Operations asap.

450
00:27:37,847 --> 00:27:39,564
You're with Strategic Operations?

451
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:41,008
They handle these checks.

452
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:44,789
Not since the 9/11 realignment,
Mr. Merrick.

453
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,341
The Chief Information Officer
does them now.

454
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:50,191
They handled Alex's last check.

455
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:55,414
When an agent reaches a level
as high as your ex-husband's,

456
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:57,690
S.O. takes over, again.

457
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:00,835
Bureaucracies.

458
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,151
Thank you for the coffee.

459
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:09,902
Look,

460
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:12,164
just get her out of here.

461
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:15,674
They're here.

462
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,419
- No, C! We gotta go!
- No, don't worry about it.

463
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:27,144
Just get the car started, all right? Go!

464
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,237
- Daddy!
-Hey, baby!

465
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:43,201
- You ready to go?
- Where are we going?

466
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,447
Disneyland.

467
00:28:44,696 --> 00:28:46,296
Mr. Franklin! You can't...

468
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:47,454
They're here!

469
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,455
Come on, let's go!

470
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,607
Go, baby. Go, baby.

471
00:28:57,692 --> 00:28:59,072
Go, go, go!

472
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,508
Franklin has the child!
Repeat, Franklin has the child!

473
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:13,828
<i>'Evening, Mrs. Hollander.</i>

474
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:16,659
<i>Don't you look lovely this evening.</i>

475
00:29:16,717 --> 00:29:18,836
<i>You should have told me what you were!</i>

476
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:20,996
My God, I let you near my children!

477
00:29:20,997 --> 00:29:24,810
Don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like.

478
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,805
Come on, get away from the road.
You wanna get caught?

479
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,736
I...

480
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:33,177
I saw you checking out
those girls back at the diner.

481
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:34,942
What?

482
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,677
Come on. Fess up.

483
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:39,665
No. I was just making sure
they weren't staring at us.

484
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,107
With what? Their asses?

485
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,052
Beautiful girls in Panama.

486
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:45,486
They love Americans.

487
00:30:46,173 --> 00:30:47,153
Cool.

488
00:30:47,663 --> 00:30:49,967
So, how long have you known about girls?

489
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:54,069
Long enough.

490
00:30:55,497 --> 00:30:56,511
Since when?

491
00:30:58,531 --> 00:30:59,582
Thirteen.

492
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,767
Thirteen?

493
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:02,707
With who?

494
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:05,697
Donna Anselmi.

495
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:07,287
She was the kid next door.

496
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,421
She was about...

497
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:10,159
She's four years older than me.

498
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,326
Your mom was paying her
for French lessons.

499
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:13,830
Well, she earned the money.

500
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:18,416
Come on.

501
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:19,905
Away from the road.

502
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,519
You're still way too close. Let's go.

503
00:31:26,154 --> 00:31:27,795
<i>You wanna learn some tricks, Gracey?</i>

504
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:28,509
<i>Like what?</i>

505
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:29,627
Yeah.

506
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,340
I let you into my life.

507
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:37,092
Yeah.

508
00:31:38,526 --> 00:31:39,837
Twenty seven!

509
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:48,390
<i>Evening, Mrs. Hollander.</i>

510
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:26,115
How are you feeling, little teddy?

511
00:32:29,976 --> 00:32:30,983
Six.

512
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:11,804
Tomorrow.

513
00:33:24,056 --> 00:33:25,785
Pam, I really can't talk right now.

514
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,565
<i>Maybe I should call back.</i>

515
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:32,172
Who is this?

516
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:34,710
I think you already know.

517
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,197
If you've done anything to Pam...

518
00:33:48,424 --> 00:33:49,459
or my boy...

519
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,482
<i>We both know your family's fine.</i>

520
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:54,721
Although, Pam did seem
a little upset about you leaving.

521
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:56,936
<i>But then you had to,</i>

522
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:58,053
didn't you?

523
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:01,377
'Cause you couldn't let her find out.

524
00:34:02,225 --> 00:34:03,646
Find out about what?

525
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,679
<i>Oscar Shales.</i>

526
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,271
You remember?

527
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:09,138
The one that got away.

528
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:12,297
Except he didn't get too far.

529
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:13,648
Did he?

530
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:17,694
- You're slipping, Scofield.
- Maybe.

531
00:34:18,521 --> 00:34:20,245
Let's hypothesize for a moment.

532
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:22,866
Let's pretend I was the one
who caught Shales.

533
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,103
<i>I don't think I could have just
handed that psychopath</i>

534
00:34:27,142 --> 00:34:28,240
<i>over to the courts,</i>

535
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:31,103
<i>not after he'd eluded me for so long.</i>

536
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:32,931
Made me look bad.

537
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:36,574
You've been out in the sun
way too long, boy.

538
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:38,380
<i>You Feds make a nice living,</i>

539
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,448
<i>but not so nice you go around
tearing up expensive sod.</i>

540
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:43,549
Not unless you had to do
a little digging,

541
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:45,612
not unless you wanted
to hide something...

542
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:47,502
<i>or someone.</i>

543
00:34:49,904 --> 00:34:51,491
That's what all the lye was for.

544
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:53,159
Wasn't it?

545
00:34:54,186 --> 00:34:56,339
<i>See, because there are two kinds
of lye.</i>

546
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,384
<i>Small amounts, the first kind
can be a garderner's best friend.</i>

547
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,112
And large bags, the other kind
decomposes bodies.

548
00:35:03,438 --> 00:35:05,270
You should write mystery novels.

549
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:07,694
<i>Now, I don't know about you,</i>

550
00:35:08,412 --> 00:35:10,934
but if I buried someone
in my own backyard,

551
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:14,547
<i>I'd think about it all the time.</i>

552
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:17,767
<i>I'd think...</i>

553
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:20,758
<i>I'd think maybe
I should move that body.</i>

554
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:24,810
<i>But then I'd remember,</i>

555
00:35:25,196 --> 00:35:27,472
<i>that D.N.A. leeches into soil.</i>

556
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,569
<i>So even when the body was gone,</i>

557
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,922
the proof of what I'd done
would still be there.

558
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,097
<i>I can imagine how it feels.</i>

559
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:39,488
<i>The pressure...</i>

560
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:42,839
the constant fear.

561
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:47,075
It's more than a man can bear.

562
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,257
<i>I give you a chance.</i>

563
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,497
Back off.

564
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,085
Let me and my family disappear.

565
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:00,568
<i>And in return,</i>

566
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:02,645
<i>I'll keep your little secret.</i>

567
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:05,746
<i>How does that sound?</i>

568
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:09,287
Like a dead man talking.

569
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:13,512
<i>I know it's not how you wanted this
to play out.</i>

570
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,784
But sometimes,
things happen that are just...

571
00:36:18,702 --> 00:36:20,145
<i>out of your control.</i>

572
00:36:22,384 --> 00:36:23,943
<i>This is one of those times.</i>

573
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:27,856
Take care of yourself.

574
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,384
I'll see you soon, Michael.

575
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:35,942
And... Michael!

576
00:36:38,143 --> 00:36:40,140
It just may be sooner than you think.

577
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:00,377
Did you have a nice nap?

578
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:03,925
Visions of 12 year olds
dancing in your head?

579
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:06,744
You're trespassing.

580
00:37:06,854 --> 00:37:09,477
Nobody lives here anymore, Goldilocks.

581
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:11,049
Seems the owner hit the bricks

582
00:37:11,138 --> 00:37:15,041
as soon as she heard
a certain someone had reentered society.

583
00:37:15,144 --> 00:37:17,853
Left in a hurry, too,
even left some stuff behind.

584
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,907
So this is where Theodore practiced

585
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,569
pervert knows best.

586
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,067
This...

587
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,761
is where he had his family supper.

588
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:33,791
And that, I believe

589
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,660
is where you and Ms. Hollander
expressed your love.

590
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:40,073
Tell me, little Teddy,

591
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:43,300
did you make her wear Dr. Denton's
and hold a lunch box

592
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,422
to help you get all worked up?

593
00:37:46,994 --> 00:37:49,808
Bradley, I couldn't possibly expect
a grown man

594
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:51,913
who still lives with his momma,

595
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:54,791
to understand the machinations of love.

596
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:06,622
You wanna know how we found you?

597
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:11,256
52 mash notes,
sent by you to this address.

598
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:16,853
All of them beggin' Ms. Hollander
to take your white-trash ass back.

599
00:38:17,858 --> 00:38:19,350
And every one of them

600
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,890
boomeranged to Fox Rive marked
"return to sender."

601
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:27,984
The guards had a real laugh
readin' them,

602
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:29,902
- didn't we, Geary?
- Damn right, we did.

603
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:32,481
That is one

604
00:38:33,046 --> 00:38:35,680
mangy lookin' paw you got there, slick.

605
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,872
What happened? A boy scout fought back?

606
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:38,908
Geary?

607
00:38:39,426 --> 00:38:40,764
Now you're gonna tell me

608
00:38:41,129 --> 00:38:43,116
where you stashed Westmoreland's money,

609
00:38:43,494 --> 00:38:45,480
or I'm going to pluck you
like a chicken,

610
00:38:45,962 --> 00:38:47,397
stitch by stitch.

611
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:58,551
Fine. You wanna know where the money is?

612
00:39:00,078 --> 00:39:02,822
I did spend a whole bunch of it
last night on your momma.

613
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:07,661
Wrong answer.

614
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,506
Come here, baby.

615
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:29,808
How are you?

616
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:32,445
- You good?
- Yeah.

617
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:33,602
She's okay.

618
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:51,334
- Baby?
- Yeah?

619
00:39:53,454 --> 00:39:54,530
What do we do, now?

620
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:30,740
What are we gonna do?

621
00:40:31,584 --> 00:40:32,946
Get a ticket on the train.

622
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:34,634
Come on.

623
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:37,669
Just wait here until the train comes.

624
00:42:11,752 --> 00:42:13,310
Two caucasian males on foot,

625
00:42:13,352 --> 00:42:14,786
fleeing the Willcox station.

626
00:42:29,777 --> 00:42:30,788
L.J!

627
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:35,656
Don't move!

628
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:39,432
Please. Please.
He's got nothing to do with this.

629
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:40,934
Face down. Both of you, face down!

630
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:42,126
- Please.
- Now!

631
00:42:44,415 --> 00:42:45,332
Cuff 'em.

632
00:42:50,098 --> 00:42:51,298
L.J, I'm sorry.

633
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:56,414
Suspect in custody.
Possible I.D: Lincoln Burrows.

634
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:01,541
I'm sorry.

635
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:04,515
L.J, I'm sorry.



9999
