1
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:02,985
Previously on Prison Break

2
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:04,357
I didn't kill that man,  Michael.

3
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:06,208
If you didn't kill Terrence Steadman,

4
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:08,778
how the hell did someone make it look like you did?

5
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:10,101
I'm getting you out of here.

6
00:00:10,236 --> 00:00:11,012
That's impossible.

7
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:12,585
Not if you designed the place,  it isn't.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,039
Better be open,  bro.

9
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:35,497
You're asking me to break the law.

10
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:38,096
I'm asking you to make a mistake: forget to lock up.

11
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:40,973
We're in.

12
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:48,674
Who killed Terrence Steadman?

13
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:50,592
Nobody.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,963
Terrence steadman's still alive.

15
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:52,980
Hello,  Terrence.

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,294
Sound the alarm!

17
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:04,594
What's going on?

18
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:13,513
Hey!

19
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,719
No!

20
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:18,893
No!

21
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:20,466
What do we do now?

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,511
We run.

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,910
The escapees,  who were they?

24
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:32,636
Got a list right here.

25
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:34,775
Read it to me,  if you could.

26
00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:39,935
Michael Scofield,  structural engineer,
five years for armed robbery.

27
00:01:40,673 --> 00:01:42,457
Benjamin Miles Franklin,

28
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:46,686
former U.S.Army,
eight years for possession of stolen goods.

29
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,189
John Abruzzi,

30
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,706
don of the crime family of the same name.

31
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:56,842
Life without parole for conspiracy to commit murder.

32
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,796
Charles "Haywire" Patoshik,

33
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:03,354
60 years for second-degree murder.

34
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,011
Fernando sucre,

35
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:09,857
five years for aggravated robbery.

36
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:13,117
David "Tweener" Apolskis,

37
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:16,090
five years for grand larceny.

38
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:20,195
Theodore "T-bag" Bagwell,

39
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:25,748
life for six counts of kidnapping,
rape and first-degree murder.

40
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:28,951
And Lincoln Burrows,

41
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:36,882
scheduled to die next week for the murder
of president reynold's brother.

42
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,879
How long has it been since they got over the wall?

43
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:43,768
8:00 last night.

44
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,482
Scofield-- he and Burrows were brothers.

45
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:47,720
That's right.

46
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,162
And he's the mastermind of this whole thing.

47
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:53,445
That's what they're saying.

48
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,082
I want everything they've got on him.

49
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,142
Where are they?

50
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:34,885
What the hell is that?

51
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:42,931
Let's go.

52
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:49,280
All we got to do is make it to the other side.

53
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,095
What?

54
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:51,419
Make it to the other side.

55
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:55,696
Come on,  guys!

56
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,875
Pick it up!

57
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:08,758
The thing is gaining speed,  man!

58
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:13,352
It's going too fast!

59
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:14,167
Go through!

60
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:14,791
What?

61
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,769
Go through!

62
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,878
Freeze!

63
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,468
I will gun you down,  Scofield!

64
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,457
Where's the aerial and the others?

65
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,991
They're back on the ground refueling.

66
00:04:58,609 --> 00:04:59,904
Son of a bitch.

67
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:05,575
Season 2
Episode 1
Manhunt

68
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,072
Sir,

69
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,750
media's ready.

70
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,401
I'd like to,  uh,

71
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,384
talk about John Wilkes Booth for
a moment if I could,

72
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,724
Abraham Lincoln's killer.

73
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:14,076
12 days,

74
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:16,483
that's how long it took to find him.

75
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:19,080
In his journal during this period,
he wrote that

76
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,209
the shadow was his friend,
the night his domain.

77
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:28,778
He acknowledged that whatever neuroses drove the
criminal to commit the original crime is compounded,

78
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:35,108
magnified by flight,
by the sounds of dogs at his heels.

79
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:37,438
Fear becomes paranoia,

80
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,689
paranoia ultimately psychosis.

81
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,667
I bring this up,
because, in 140 years,

82
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:49,599
the fundamental mind of the
escaped man has not changed.

83
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:51,824
The escaped man is still human.

84
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:57,127
He is still afraid,  and he will stop
at nothing in his attempt at flight.

85
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:00,273
Fortunately for us,

86
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:05,528
while our quarry has shadow
and night as his ally,

87
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:07,840
we have something far greater:

88
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:10,909
Television.

89
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:14,572
I would encourage everyone who is watching,

90
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,318
everyone in this country

91
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,389
to take a good look at these faces.

92
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,012
These men right here are now the
eight-most-wanted men in America.

93
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,231
I thought I thought this out.

94
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:33,465
You saw all those guys back there?

95
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:35,901
The key is they're back there,
and we're up here.

96
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,570
Yeah, and how long is that going to last?

97
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,934
Yeah,  especially since we don't have a pot to piss
in thanks to Abruzzi's magically disappearing jet.

98
00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:44,197
Hey,  you were never going to
be on that plane, brother.

99
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:46,125
And don't think I don't know where
you were going either, Scofield.

100
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:47,036
Where am I going?

101
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:50,047
Oh, I don't know. Utah?

102
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:53,346
When were you planning on
telling us about the money, man?

103
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:54,372
What money?

104
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:59,148
$5 million that westmoreland
planted in the desert in Utah.

105
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:01,939
You don't know what you're talking about.

106
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:03,867
You wish I didn't know.

107
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:05,411
Wait, wait. What money?

108
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:09,918
Warden?

109
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:13,850
It's a little early for the fbi
to be showing up,  don't you think?

110
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:15,231
Look,  I get it.

111
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:16,478
It's still your investigation,

112
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,375
but once those criminals cross state lines,
it'll become a federal matter.

113
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:20,938
Yeah,  well,  that is not going to happen.

114
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,050
I hope you're right.

115
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:26,299
That's why I was going to suggest that we cut
through any interagency politics from the outset.

116
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:27,680
Full transparency.

117
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:28,917
Absolutely.

118
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:30,020
Good.

119
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,868
Then maybe you can tell me about Dr.Tancredi.

120
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,295
There's nothing to tell.

121
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:38,805
From what I'm hearing,
she may have abetted the escapees;

122
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:41,500
opened the door that allowed them to get out.

123
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:43,916
Like I said,  there's nothing to tell.

124
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:45,710
You're not being very transparent,  warden.

125
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:47,954
Look,  I don't discuss my staff.

126
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,325
Maybe you should,

127
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,627
because she may be the key to this thing.

128
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:54,456
We need to speak with her.

129
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:57,640
Right now,  Mr.Mahone,

130
00:08:57,688 --> 00:08:59,741
she's not going to be eating with anyone.

131
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:08,736
How are we doing?

132
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:10,616
Well, the IVs are hydrating her.

133
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:14,222
We got her on a naloxone infusion,
half milligram per hour.

134
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,380
What do you think the chances are?

135
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:19,794
Well, we've done everything on our end.
It's really up to her.

136
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:24,647
Either she fights and lives,
or she quits and dies.

137
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,111
hey! What do you think...

138
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:22,065
do whatevething you got to do, man.

139
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:28,538
Oh, and...

140
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:29,909
boy...

141
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:34,053
you call the cops,
I will put this thing right here...

142
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,313
...in your eye.

143
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:43,278
Thank you.

144
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:01,711
Structural engineer,  huh?

145
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,521
Not the kind you'd expect to get
that much ink.

146
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,382
Not the kind at all.

147
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:09,777
How long do you think it'd take
to get something like that?

148
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:11,589
Hundred hours...

149
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:13,037
200.

150
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,934
Tattoo artist who gave it to him must
have spent a lot of time on him then.

151
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,051
I'll find out who it was.

152
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,222
Mr.Bellick.

153
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:24,345
Don't talk to me.

154
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,368
Fine, but it's going to make
collaboration kind of hard.

155
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,893
Collaboration?

156
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:31,595
I got men out here in harm's way,
and you're giving press conferences.

157
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,216
The press is a tool.

158
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:35,652
It'll bring those men back
quicker than bloodhounds will.

159
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,946
We don't need you.

160
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,919
We're hot on these guys' trail,
and it's just a matter of time till we nail them.

161
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:42,451
The problem I find with being on a trail

162
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,626
is that by definition you'll
always be behind your prey.

163
00:11:47,803 --> 00:11:49,385
We'll see about that.

164
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:55,274
[BLACKFOOT.MONTANA]

165
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:57,892
I'm not armed.

166
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:00,788
You'll have to excuse me if I'm a
little short on trust at the moment.

167
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,902
I assure you, young woman,
I'm the furthest thing from a threat.

168
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:07,712
I think the percocet pretty much ensures that.

169
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:12,086
Good,  then you won't mind if I
capture this moment for posterity.

170
00:12:12,469 --> 00:12:14,042
Won't do you any good.

171
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:17,792
You don't care that someone's going to be executed
for your murder while you're just sitting here.

172
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,516
I'm not the one choose Lincoln
Burrows as the fall guy.

173
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:21,618
Who did?

174
00:12:22,184 --> 00:12:23,728
Your sister,
the president?

175
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:26,116
You don't understand.
I'm a prisoner to all of this.

176
00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:28,351
Oh, come on.
You could have come forward.

177
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,566
You could have stopped this
thing before it even got started.

178
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,146
No,  I really am a prisoner.

179
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:35,256
And now,  you are,  too.

180
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:38,469
The moment you let that door shut behind you.

181
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:48,846
Didn't it strike you as curious

182
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:53,602
that there wasn't any security out there?
The doors only open from the outside.

183
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:57,132
The glass is two inches thick, bulletproof.

184
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:02,013
There's no getting out of here,
young woman.

185
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:07,978
We got to dump them now.

186
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:09,580
Can't.

187
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:11,383
They know about Utah.

188
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,253
All the more reason to dump them.

189
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:15,641
If they get caught,  the feds
will know exactly where we're going.

190
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:16,639
They'll tell them.

191
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:20,187
We just got to make sure they stay
afloat until we're off in Utah,

192
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:22,220
doing what we got to do.

193
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:25,558
You really think the money's
going to be there?

194
00:13:27,831 --> 00:13:30,391
Charles might have had a flexible
relationship with the truth,

195
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:31,993
but at the end...

196
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:34,755
at the end,  there'd be no
reason for him to lie about it.

197
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:38,035
I figure once we bag it,
we cross over into Mexico,

198
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:41,526
take a whole bunch of mpy
second-class bus rides till we hit panama.

199
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,834
You really got a fix on
this dive shop thing,  huh?

200
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:45,755
yeah.

201
00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:50,857
Right now,  I wouldn't mind swinging
in a hammock for the next ten or 20 years.

202
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,971
We got half the country after us.
We ain't making it to Panama or Utah.

203
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,209
Not without help.

204
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:59,834
Veronica can't help us.

205
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:00,975
How can you say that?

206
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:03,133
- We don't have money,  clothes...
- I already got all that.

207
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,547
I thought the plan was Abruzzi's jet.

208
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,292
Abruzzi's jet was plan A.

209
00:14:09,904 --> 00:14:11,419
- Then we got...
- everything we need.

210
00:14:11,793 --> 00:14:12,781
Where?

211
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:15,907
Storage.

212
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:26,975
Scofield designed the tattoo, not you?

213
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:29,948
He brought the entire thing in,
every element.

214
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:32,441
I mean, look at it; it's the
Freakin' sistine chapel.

215
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:33,976
I knew the guy was an engineer or whatever,

216
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:36,949
but man, his skill as an artist was unbelievable.

217
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:39,826
What else? What can you tell
me about him as a person?

218
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:42,127
he was cool, you know.

219
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:43,758
But talk about a detail nazi.

220
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,580
Everything had to be perfect,

221
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,882
exactly as he drew it.

222
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:49,704
I always sort of had the feeling that
the whole thing...

223
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:52,869
was some sort of inside joke that
only he was in on.

224
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:59,006
We have your number, right?

225
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:02,075
I may be calling you.

226
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:02,843
Thank you.

227
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:07,254
Foley!

228
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,049
What was the name of that long road
we took to get to the prison?

229
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,968
English boulevard

230
00:15:17,995 --> 00:15:19,050
and out in front of the prison,

231
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,969
the two streets that intersect with it?

232
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:22,791
Fitz and Percy.
Why?

233
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,750
Thank you.

234
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:28,353
Saddle up.

235
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:29,696
Where we going?

236
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,861
Somewhere where we can stop being
cons and start being civilians.

237
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:34,875
You know, why don't you cut out
all the riddles, snowflake?

238
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,409
and just give it to us straight.

239
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:37,944
What?

240
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:43,698
Hi.

241
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,013
little one.

242
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,452
What are you doing?

243
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:54,247
we're just fishing.

244
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,316
With no poles?

245
00:15:57,892 --> 00:15:59,906
we like to fish with our hands.

246
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:01,248
Yes,  eh...

247
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:02,687
hand-fishing.

248
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:04,797
I think the question is...

249
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:09,016
what are you doing out here?

250
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:11,894
- Hunting.
- Gracie?

251
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:13,140
Get away

252
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,675
Gracie, get away.

253
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:15,730
Get back

254
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:18,223
You're those guys from fox river.

255
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:21,484
Don't...
don't any of you move a freakin' muscle.

256
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,085
Get away from her!

257
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:32,044
Get away from her!

258
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:33,866
Okay, okay, just...

259
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,017
Relax,

260
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:36,360
relax.

261
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:38,565
Sir...

262
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,004
you stay where you are.

263
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:41,155
No

264
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:42,785
Put the gun down.

265
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:43,936
- Let her go.
- Right now.

266
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:44,799
You let her go!

267
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,238
John, Let go of the girl.

268
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,389
Shut up!

269
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:48,060
John, put the girl down.

270
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,923
Drop the gun!

271
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:51,992
Drop the gun!

272
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:54,390
Drop it now.

273
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:56,308
Drop the gun!

274
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:58,513
One.

275
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:00,527
I'll pull the trigger.

276
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:02,446
Two!

277
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:06,857
Good boy

278
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:09,159
Good boy

279
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:10,118
Get the gun.

280
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:12,036
Pick it up!

281
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:16,448
Don't you hurt her,  don't you...

282
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:18,749
You're going to be all right.

283
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:24,120
Run to daddy.

284
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:28,627
I ain't going to say anything,
to anybody, man.

285
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:30,929
you are not going to get hurt,
so just calm down

286
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:31,504
Where's your car?

287
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:32,463
Up on the road.

288
00:17:32,463 --> 00:17:33,902
Keys.

289
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,288
You're being considered
an accessory to this;

290
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:50,014
you know that,
don't you?

291
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,179
I know very little right now.

292
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:54,617
You opened the door to the infirmary that

293
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:57,878
allowed Scofield to escape,
didn't you?

294
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:58,645
No.

295
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,563
Did you have a sexual relationship
with Scofield?

296
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:01,331
No.

297
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,440
But you had feelings for him.

298
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,509
Seven other men got out, you know.

299
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:09,578
Who?

300
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:25,211
I am sorry, sir.

301
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:26,649
It's saturday; we're not open.

302
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,526
that's sort of the point.

303
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,677
Sorry, sir?

304
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:32,403
See,

305
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,938
I'm going to need some work done,

306
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:36,527
and I'm going to need it done privately.

307
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:37,103
I'm sorry,

308
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:38,925
you said you needed the work done?

309
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,761
This is a medical clinic, isn't it?

310
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:45,638
of course it is, sir,
but for animals.

311
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,009
man, what happened to you?

312
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:52,447
You need medical attention.

313
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:53,119
Sir, listen...

314
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:53,694
hold up.

315
00:18:53,694 --> 00:18:55,229
I'm going to get an ambulance.

316
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,983
nobody's going to be doing any
calling here, doctor.

317
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:01,942
Fine.

318
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:06,545
Wh... what do you want?

319
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:14,314
You know what?

320
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:15,273
That's it.

321
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:17,287
I want eye-tie out of the car right now, man.

322
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,629
That was a little girl!

323
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:20,547
Don't you have a heart?

324
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:22,274
God! I have a daughter.

325
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:23,424
I have a little girl!

326
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,918
I got one,  too.

327
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:28,987
But if I hadn't done what I had to do,

328
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,727
we wouldn't be on our way to
see 'em right now,  would we?

329
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:33,974
Turn right up there.

330
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:35,317
Hold on.

331
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:36,755
Where we going?

332
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:37,810
Oswego

333
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:39,632
That's west, man.

334
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:40,399
We need to go east.

335
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:42,030
My family's back in Chicago.

336
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,523
And you think the cops
don't know about it?

337
00:19:45,003 --> 00:19:46,633
You think they're not just sitting there,

338
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:49,318
waiting for you to come running back home?

339
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,004
What's the matter with you?

340
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:53,634
what about New York?

341
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:54,401
What about...

342
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,744
I... My girl's pregnant,  bro.

343
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:59,868
Understand your love is
your weakness right now,

344
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:01,211
and they know about it.

345
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:02,745
Doesn't mean it has to stop you.

346
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,430
You just got to be smart about it.

347
00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:07,924
Get to Oswego.

348
00:20:07,924 --> 00:20:10,417
Oswego was not on the way, snowflake.

349
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,335
It's not where Oswego is.

350
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,172
It's what's in Oswego.

351
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:17,898
Captain,

352
00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:20,583
Scofield's credit card transaction history.

353
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:23,364
Spent a lot of money here in Will
county before he was incarcerated?

354
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:24,899
Exactly.

355
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:25,378
He was from Chicago.

356
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:26,913
Why does a guy from chicago come
all the way out here

357
00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:29,790
and spend north of eight grand in all
these places in little over a month?

358
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,804
Car wash, voice mail,
storage, car rental...

359
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:32,571
we got guys looking into it.

360
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:33,051
Good.

361
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:33,914
captain,  what about the feds?

362
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:34,393
Should we tell them?

363
00:20:34,393 --> 00:20:35,640
What do you think?

364
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,503
Captain bellick?

365
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:37,270
We got something.

366
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,148
Hunter up by tamarack just ran into
five of the cons.

367
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:48,779
So this is where Scofield lived?

368
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:52,232
up until about two months
ago when he was incarcerated.

369
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,273
Mother's dead,
father's a deadbeat.

370
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,206
You got nothing in the whole
world but your brother.

371
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:11,796
So you plan.

372
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,304
And you scheme for months...

373
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,716
till you get it right...

374
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:31,936
Every single element.

375
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:42,102
And then you destroy all the evidence.

376
00:21:53,035 --> 00:21:54,953
I want divers down in the river.

377
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:00,611
You won't get cell coverage.

378
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,241
We're in the middle of nowhere.

379
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:07,420
Digital carriers don't have cell towers
way out here in Western Montana.

380
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,051
How about shutting up, Terrence?

381
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:10,297
Just trying to save you some effort.

382
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:11,448
They're like a web, these people.

383
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:13,174
The harder you struggle,
the worse it gets.

384
00:22:13,174 --> 00:22:16,819
Sounds to me like a coward trying
to justify himself.

385
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,641
If I stay out of the way and stay quiet,

386
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:19,792
I stay alive.

387
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,998
That's what they said;
that's what they told me.

388
00:22:21,998 --> 00:22:23,820
And you're willing to live like this,

389
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,217
in a hermetically-sealed box while
everything out there goes to hell?

390
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:29,095
Self-preservation is a strong motivator.

391
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:31,013
So is the truth.

392
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:35,232
Don't.

393
00:22:37,726 --> 00:22:38,685
Young woman?

394
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:43,672
Do not

395
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,508
Don't

396
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:52,303
How you doing, buddy?

397
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:53,550
I'm pretty freaked out,

398
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,085
that's how I'm doing.

399
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:56,139
They took your car, didn't they?

400
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:58,153
1978 Grand Cherokee.

401
00:22:58,153 --> 00:22:59,208
Which way did they go?

402
00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:02,086
Up that way north toward Oswego.

403
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:02,853
Oswego.

404
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:03,908
Pardon me.

405
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:05,826
Scofield's paperwork...
get it,  Jimmy.

406
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:07,456
The credit card stuff.

407
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:08,799
Right here, captain.

408
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:14,937
Of course.

409
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:18,389
Where is he going to put all the
crap you need to disappear?

410
00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:21,266
We're going to Oswego, boys.

411
00:23:31,814 --> 00:23:33,157
You have a visitor

412
00:23:34,403 --> 00:23:35,075
Thank you.

413
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:45,241
Thanks.

414
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:48,885
You look disappointed.

415
00:23:49,365 --> 00:23:51,378
No. I thought you were going
to be my father.

416
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:53,872
You heard from him?

417
00:23:54,543 --> 00:23:55,790
His office.

418
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:00,010
Brought you a change of clothes.

419
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:03,271
Figured,  you know...

420
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:04,421
Thanks.

421
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,340
And your purse.

422
00:24:06,723 --> 00:24:08,449
You left it in the infmary.

423
00:24:16,218 --> 00:24:18,807
I'm in a lot of trouble,  I think.

424
00:24:19,478 --> 00:24:20,725
I...

425
00:24:23,123 --> 00:24:25,904
I need to apologize to you.

426
00:24:38,755 --> 00:24:41,440
They threatened my job
if I didn't talk,  and...

427
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,399
No, no, no, no.

428
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,167
No.

429
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:46,236
One thing you learn when you're
walking the steps is

430
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:49,880
that you never outsource a blame that
belongs in your own backyard.

431
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:58,511
You're not the first correctional
worker that fell for a con,

432
00:24:58,511 --> 00:24:59,470
trust me.

433
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:04,074
He never cared.

434
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,143
Not one bit.

435
00:25:13,952 --> 00:25:14,431
What are you thinking about?

436
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:18,459
Mistakes.

437
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:20,569
You had to do it.

438
00:25:21,624 --> 00:25:23,063
Not like i did.

439
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:27,282
I ruined her life.

440
00:25:28,337 --> 00:25:29,968
There's nothing you can do about it now.

441
00:25:29,968 --> 00:25:31,119
That's not true.

442
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:34,955
You fell for her, huh?

443
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,517
Where's Oswego?

444
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,627
Half mile maybe

445
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:44,545
Good.

446
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,669
What are you going to do, Terrence,
shoot me?

447
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:50,012
Blow my guts all over this house?

448
00:25:50,012 --> 00:25:51,354
Then what?

449
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:53,272
You can't leave, remember?

450
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:55,095
You kill me,
you're stuck with me.

451
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,547
I'm safe here.

452
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:00,273
You're a prisoner here.

453
00:26:00,273 --> 00:26:01,808
But I'm still breathing.

454
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:05,260
If I go outside...

455
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:07,658
one step,

456
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:08,521
I won't be.

457
00:26:11,207 --> 00:26:12,357
You look at me...

458
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,275
like I'm the devil.

459
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:17,153
I gave up my family.

460
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:20,126
My teeth.

461
00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:22,715
I eat percocet all day

462
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,496
just to dull the pain of
my miserable existence.

463
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:27,606
You have no idea what
I've been through.

464
00:26:27,606 --> 00:26:29,045
What you've been through?

465
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:33,264
This isn't about you, Terrence.

466
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,991
Don't.

467
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:40,937
Blackfoot Sheriff's department.

468
00:26:42,088 --> 00:26:42,855
Hello.

469
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:44,869
Blackfoot Sheriff's department

470
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,020
My name's Veronica Donovan.

471
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,554
I need you to send a unit to the house

472
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:49,664
at the end of light road
as soon as possible.

473
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:52,445
I'm sorry,  ma'am,
but are you calling to report a crime?

474
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:56,473
By the President of the United States.

475
00:26:58,775 --> 00:26:59,926
Send the car.

476
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:01,173
I'm sorry,  sir,

477
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:03,282
I... I don't think I can do this.

478
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:04,050
There are nerves...

479
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,105
Look,

480
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:06,735
You need a specialist,  okay?

481
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:07,214
I don't...

482
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:09,324
You... You need somebody
who knows what they're doing.

483
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:11,338
I don't have the luxury
of choice here, Doctor.

484
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,969
My hand has been in that box
for hours now.

485
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:13,736
It is dying.

486
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:15,654
Sir,
I am not capable of doing this.

487
00:27:15,654 --> 00:27:16,997
I only have one hand,

488
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:19,682
but I could stick this in your neck
before you get to that door.

489
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:21,408
Now, if that's not
incentive enough for you,

490
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:23,518
I see that you have
a Mrs. Gudat out there.

491
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:25,724
With a name like that in
a county like this,

492
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:29,464
old Mrs. Gudat would not be too hard
to find now, would she?

493
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:30,615
Fine.

494
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:32,917
I can promise you nothing.

495
00:27:34,163 --> 00:27:35,794
Story of my life.

496
00:27:36,945 --> 00:27:38,671
I'll have to put you under.

497
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:41,836
Do I really look that stupid?

498
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:45,384
Sir, I cannot do a procedure like this
without an anesthetic.

499
00:27:45,384 --> 00:27:47,111
I have to cut away dead flesh.

500
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:50,563
Nobody can undergo a procedure like
this without an anesthetic!

501
00:27:50,563 --> 00:27:53,632
I ain't nobody.

502
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:57,468
Schweitzer was the plumbing company

503
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:00,345
that made the toilet Scofield took off
to get out of his cell.

504
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,880
Allen Boltas the fitting.

505
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,606
It's all here, isn't it?

506
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,100
It's amazing.

507
00:28:07,826 --> 00:28:08,785
Ripe Chance Woods

508
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:10,511
There a place in the vicinity
with that name?

509
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:11,854
Got someone looking into it.

510
00:28:11,854 --> 00:28:15,019
D.O.C.'s moving on a storage
facility in Oswego.

511
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:30,267
Captain,

512
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:33,432
Manager says that Scofield's
got a lease on unit 164.

513
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:34,679
It's still active.

514
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,789
We got guys on 8th street, 3rd street,
then the alley.

515
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:37,940
If they're in there, captain,

516
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,090
we got 'em boxed.

517
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,145
We push right up the gut, then.

518
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:41,872
Any one of them makes
a threatening move,

519
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:42,927
put a hole in 'em.

520
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:43,886
You got it.

521
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:46,763
Officer...

522
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,558
this is my collar, smart guy.

523
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:53,092
Back the hell off.

524
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:03,066
Close the door.

525
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:10,336
Still nothing on this place?

526
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:12,110
Nope.
They're coming back with nothing.

527
00:29:13,923 --> 00:29:16,397
No place by that name anywhere
in this country.

528
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:19,236
Or any other country, for that matter.

529
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,372
Let's go.

530
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:50,980
Son of a bitch set us up.

531
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:24,614
Not one word.

532
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,481
Officer...

533
00:30:33,494 --> 00:30:34,626
Nothing.

534
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:37,877
Oh.

535
00:30:38,443 --> 00:30:40,169
Oh, that kid's clever.

536
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:43,670
It's not a place, it's a name.

537
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:46,019
Your PDA, you got it?

538
00:30:46,374 --> 00:30:47,237
Yeah.

539
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:50,345
Bring up the census of this county.

540
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,570
Far back as it goes.

541
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,125
Somebody's going to see us.

542
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,305
Keep digging.

543
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:00,933
We're gonna go to hell, guys.

544
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:02,668
Swear to god, we're gonna go to hell.

545
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:08,221
Help me out.

546
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:17,955
You are one sick cat, you know that?

547
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,731
What are you looking for?

548
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,102
We got to go to the cemetery.

549
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,464
Now.

550
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:39,138
originally, this was supposed to be
a week's worth of clothes for me and Linc.

551
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:42,360
But, uh, figured you all need just
as much help as we do, so...

552
00:31:42,446 --> 00:31:44,748
you're just doing this out of the goodness
of your heart, fish?

553
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:46,436
That's right, John,
the heart.

554
00:31:46,513 --> 00:31:47,635
You remember what that is, don't you?

555
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:49,083
Damn, snowflake,
this is tight, man.

556
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:51,797
It's like I said,
we got to stop being cons

557
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:53,945
start being civilians.

558
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:11,870
Nice.

559
00:32:11,975 --> 00:32:14,344
Trousers are a little bit too short,
don't you think?

560
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,377
Chop your feet off.
You're good at that.

561
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:19,235
This jacket ain't exactly the best thing,
you know what I'm saying?

562
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:21,192
You want variety, hit target?

563
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:26,246
Linc

564
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,180
When do we got?

565
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,549
Money,  Passports...

566
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:34,110
pre-paid phone cards.

567
00:32:35,894 --> 00:32:37,984
- Archie Ryan?
- Did you see mine?

568
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,663
Phineas Mcclintock

569
00:32:43,326 --> 00:32:44,477
These?

570
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,405
Keys to a car that's waiting for us

571
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:48,304
A couple hundred yards from here.

572
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,704
That a two-of-us or five-of-us?

573
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:50,864
That's a two-of-us.

574
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:52,974
They know?

575
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:54,547
Not yet.

576
00:32:58,326 --> 00:33:00,378
Guy-guy-guys,
we got company.

577
00:33:49,078 --> 00:33:50,603
Guys, we got to roll.

578
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:53,106
How did he know?

579
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:42,621
We're civilians;
remember that.

580
00:34:43,273 --> 00:34:44,712
Civilians.

581
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:47,733
I'm sorry,  uh.

582
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,980
Do you know what time it is?

583
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:50,035
No, sorry.

584
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,166
I can't go outside.

585
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:08,045
They'll kill me as soon as
I show my face.

586
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:09,283
You're wrong about that.

587
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,357
As soon as you show your face,

588
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:12,313
this whole thing is gonna be over.

589
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:14,433
You can have your life back, Terrence.

590
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,120
Promise?

591
00:35:16,207 --> 00:35:17,089
I promise.

592
00:35:20,062 --> 00:35:20,791
Hello.

593
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:23,045
V, it's me.

594
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:24,742
- Linc?
- We're out.

595
00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:26,363
Thank god you're okay.

596
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,965
I saw the news.
You got to stop.

597
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,748
I need you to turn yourself in.

598
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:30,487
What?

599
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:31,369
I found steadman.

600
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:33,546
I'm with him now, linc.
He's alive.

601
00:35:34,074 --> 00:35:35,618
You're going to be exonerated.

602
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,478
Come in.

603
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:38,552
Steadman...

604
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,509
what are you talking about,
you found steadman?

605
00:35:40,854 --> 00:35:42,465
Terrence, come on, let's go.

606
00:35:42,552 --> 00:35:43,770
- Afternoon
- Veronica

607
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:44,930
The police are here.

608
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:46,512
Look, I need you to stay where you are.

609
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:47,730
Ma'am.

610
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,188
I don't want to lose you.

611
00:35:49,284 --> 00:35:51,068
Ma'am, put the phone down.

612
00:35:51,164 --> 00:35:52,037
What?

613
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:54,377
Mr.Steadman, take a few steps back.

614
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,522
Ver...

615
00:35:57,848 --> 00:35:58,299
Veronica.

616
00:35:58,385 --> 00:35:59,834
Veronica.

617
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:01,569
Oh, my god.

618
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:03,459
Veronica!

619
00:36:42,741 --> 00:36:44,064
I thought you knew that all calls to

620
00:36:44,141 --> 00:36:45,848
the local station are routed through us.

621
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:48,131
This is federal land, remember?

622
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:51,161
And, uh, as for your little toy here,

623
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,562
it's contraband.

624
00:36:52,936 --> 00:36:54,499
You gonna tell us how you got it in there?

625
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:57,529
I brought it when I got here.

626
00:36:58,009 --> 00:36:59,304
Whatever for?

627
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,126
To protect myself.

628
00:37:02,037 --> 00:37:04,473
That's what we're here for, remember?

629
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:14,866
In less than a day,
the trail has gone cold

630
00:38:14,972 --> 00:38:16,964
in the pursuit of what
are now being called...

631
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:17,845
Yeah, it's fine

632
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:18,923
Stay on top of it, all right?

633
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:20,755
Doc's still doing a sweep of Oswego,

634
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:22,366
but the guys have basically vanished.

635
00:38:22,443 --> 00:38:24,111
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Mr.Ives.

636
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:25,991
I don't know how you can be so confident.

637
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:27,775
It's not like these guys left
a map where they're going.

638
00:38:27,861 --> 00:38:29,981
Actually, that's exactly
what they did.

639
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,980
Scofield had the entire thing
on his body...

640
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:35,687
how to get out of that prison,

641
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,864
how to disappear afterward.

642
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:39,399
It's all there.

643
00:38:40,003 --> 00:38:42,496
I promise you that it's
only a matter of time

644
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:46,802
before we know everything that
is in Scofield's head--

645
00:38:47,512 --> 00:38:50,101
where he plans to run to,
how he plans to get there.

646
00:38:50,188 --> 00:38:52,691
So when the time comes that
he does get there

647
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,309
we'll be waiting for him.



9999
