1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:02,997
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,227
We're staying.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,437
Give them hell.

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,370
Bill, don't do this.

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,449
I've dedicated my life to this country,
to President Reynolds.

6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:21,519
-I've been a perfect soldier.
-Every photo, file. Get rid of all.

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,746
Bill, don 't do this.

8
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,549
You left a message for Mr. Geary.

9
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,589
I'm gonna gut you, bow to stern.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,024
I did not kill Roy Geary!
Bagwell set me up!

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,062
You are under arrest for the murder
of Roy William Geary.

12
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,700
My therapist said
that I need to confront you...

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,029
...to let you know how betrayed I feel.

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,305
This is the Tribune Police.

15
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:43,565
Just as long as you do your job,
we'll forget about Shales.

16
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,871
And then you can go back to Colorado
and visit your son, Cameron.

17
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,877
Don't you ever mention his name again.

18
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,450
What about your friend there?

19
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,453
If we're gonna go down,
might as well go down swinging.

20
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,093
-Sara.
-Michael?

21
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,400
-Almost made it.
-Hello?

22
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,677
Hello, Michael?

23
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,776
-Is that you?
-Get up.

24
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,912
Turn around.

25
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:28,443
Turn around!

26
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:32,588
If you're gonna murder us, Alex, you'll
have to look us in the eyes while you do it.

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,590
-Shut up.
-You want me, you got me.

28
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,092
Let my brother go!

29
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,129
I don't want either of you.
I just want my life back!

30
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,290
You're gonna kill two innocent men
to get it?

31
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:45,268
-Absolutely.
-This is the United States Border Patrol.

32
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,464
Drop the weapon
and remain where you are.

33
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,040
Drop the weapon.

34
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:54,807
United States Border Patrol!
Drop your weapon!

35
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,040
All agents hold your positions.

36
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:01,153
-I'm FBl. These men are in my custody.
-I don't care who you are.

37
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:06,020
Until we verify, you will drop
your weapon or we will drop you.

38
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,216
Your choice.

39
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,139
Move in!

40
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,201
Hands on your head now!

41
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,876
Don't move.

42
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,115
You got anything to drink?

43
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,087
Check the back.

44
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,319
Unknown rider, unknown rider.
This is DEA on guard.

45
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,429
Radio frequency--

46
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,760
-What do you mean " uh-oh "?
-Border Patrol ' s on our ass, man.

47
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,408
-How long till we get to Mexico?
-We' re already in Mexico, papi.

48
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,377
I thought they couldn't follow...

49
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,672
-...once we cross the border.
-Not since 9/1 1.

50
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,445
I repeat: Unknown rider, unknown rider.

51
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,208
What are we gonna do?

52
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,910
Pull the cord and pray.

53
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,849
Oh, hell, no.

54
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,288
Look, we try and land the plane,
we're pinched for sure.

55
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,949
And if we jump?

56
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,323
We're in the middle of the desert.

57
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,157
PatroI'll have a hard time
trying to find us once we land.

58
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,032
If we land.

59
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,430
Oh, you gonna land.

60
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,127
It's just a matter of how hard.

61
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,337
Good luck, amigo.

62
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,518
We're receiving reports
that escaped convicts...

63
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,595
...Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield,
have been apprehended...

64
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,231
...just a few miles north
of the U. S.-Mexican border.

65
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:57,733
Federal Agent Alex Mahone, with assistance
from the United States Border Patrol...

66
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,498
...took the men into custody
just a short time ago.

67
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,641
Now, not a lot of information
available...

68
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,277
...but the brothers were apprehended
without incident...

69
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,846
... while attempting to leave the country
through the deserts of New Mexico.

70
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,540
A long way from
Illinois ' Fox River State Penitentiary...

71
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,380
... where they escaped from
less than 1 0 days ago.

72
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,387
The Fox River Eight, as the group
of convicts were once known...

73
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,958
...are now down to four,
as only Benjamin Miles Franklin...

74
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:25,860
...Fernando Sucre, Charles Patoshik,
and Theodore Bagwell remain at large.

75
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,624
-Officials say it's only--
-Sir?

76
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,462
He just heard, and he'd like to see you.

77
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,865
--back behind prison walls.

78
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,939
Tips continue to pour in
to manhunt's national hot line--

79
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,575
--now down to four,
as only Benjamin Miles Franklin...

80
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,977
...Fernando Sucre, Charles Patoshik...

81
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,980
...and Theodore Bagwell remain at large.

82
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,847
-Godspeed, gentlemen.
-Officials say it's a matter of days...

83
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,582
...before the rest of the Fox River Eight
are back behind prison walls.

84
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,727
Tips continue to pour in
to manhunt's national hot line...

85
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:59,228
...and officials believe all four fugitives
are still on American soil...

86
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,768
...allaying fears that they may have escaped
across the Mexican border....

87
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,501
Excuse me, sarge.

88
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,808
I was wondering if you
could help a brother out.

89
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,312
With what?

90
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,852
I only recently returned from delivering
democracy to the desert...

91
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,649
...and I was wondering
if you could tell me...

92
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,816
...how a guy goes about getting
one of those prosthetic jobbies.

93
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,159
Didn't they make you whole
before they shipped you?

94
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:36,564
Well, let's just say the doctor made the bed,
he just neglected to tuck in the sheets.

95
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,034
Best thing for you to do is go on down there
to the VA, get in line.

96
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,300
That simple?

97
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah.

98
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,005
Till they send you the bill,
and you gotta pay it.

99
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,615
Those bastards in Washington
send us to fight for them.

100
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,412
-Not a damn one of them fights for us.
-Man, that is a crime.

101
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,886
But luckily for me...

102
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,292
...money is not the issue.

103
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,849
Is that right?

104
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,260
Any particular forms I might need
in order to qualify?

105
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,367
You know what,
Mr. Don't-Ask-Don't-Tell?

106
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,594
You figured out how to dye
that hair of yours...

107
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,637
...up like a nancy all by yourself.

108
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,367
You sure as hell can figure out
how to get a prosthetic...

109
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,807
...for that stump of yours by yourself.

110
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:28,119
Yeah, I think I got a pretty good idea
where to start.

111
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,533
I'm here with Ed Pavelka, the new warden
of Fox River Penitentiary...

112
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,833
...where Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield...

113
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,408
...are scheduled to be returned to
some time tomorrow.

114
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,841
Now, warden, the escape happened
a mere two days...

115
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,277
...before Burrows was scheduled
to be put to death.

116
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,941
He's already been granted one day.
Do you anticipate any further?

117
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,316
Lincoln Burrows is a convicted murderer.

118
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,822
His escape has endangered the lives
of civilians across this country.

119
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,258
He is not a celebrity. He is not a martyr.

120
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:15,027
And I can assure you that whatever leniency
was afforded him and the other prisoners...

121
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,568
...under the old regime at Fox River
will no longer be tolerated.

122
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:23,198
The only thing that Mr. Burrows can expect
is what a jury of his peers demanded:

123
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,273
A speedy execution.

124
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,345
And Michael Scofield?

125
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,380
With his escape,
the aiding and abetting charges...

126
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,782
...the felonies he's racked up along the way
on top of his original sentence...

127
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:39,482
...I'd say Mr. Scofield will be spending
the rest of his life behind bars. Thank you.

128
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,923
Warden, one more question, sir.

129
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,698
Who's got Mahone?

130
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,028
-Congratulations, sir.
-What do you got?

131
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,900
A call from the lllinois DOC.

132
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,872
They're sending a contingent
to collect Burrows and Scofield...

133
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,533
...take them back to Fox River.

134
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,738
Remind them this is a federal case,
we'll handle transport. Now--

135
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,248
I did, but it's an election year.
Collar this big, everybody wants a piece.

136
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,409
Warden called in a favor
to the Bureau chief.

137
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,111
He okayed it, so here we are.

138
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,916
Should be there in about an hour.

139
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,219
I wanna be placed
in the prisoner-transport vehicle.

140
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,692
-What for?
-Just get it done.

141
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:55,165
Sir, these were the big fish,
and you brought them in.

142
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,666
You should feel good about that.

143
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,136
Yeah.

144
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,239
Yeah.

145
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,239
Well, at least we're together.

146
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,572
Yes, there is that.

147
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,443
What are you thinking?

148
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,677
Thinking about the old man.

149
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,818
What he tried to do, you know.

150
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,926
Tough to go down swinging
when you're locked in a box.

151
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,995
This isn't over yet.
We're entitled to a phone call.

152
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,659
We make that call to Sara and she has
the information Dad said she has.

153
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,237
We can get you exonerated
before this thing goes down.

154
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,341
-Michael, it's....
-Hey.

155
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,841
We're entitled to a phone call.

156
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:45,143
You're entitled to precisely squat
until you're officially in custody.

157
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:49,755
And that won't happen until you're back
in Fox River, so sit tight.

158
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,125
It's not over yet.

159
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,928
Not yet.

160
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,798
A lot of ground to cover
between here and lllinois.

161
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,932
I mean....

162
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,867
What are the chances
we even make it to Fox River alive?

163
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,745
Saw you on the news, Alex.

164
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,143
-Did you?
-The brothers too.

165
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,809
They were a little more...

166
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,044
...breathing than I'd hoped.

167
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,812
Yeah, well, Border Patrol showed up.

168
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,684
-Nothing I could do.
-Really?

169
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,724
Burrows and Scofield,
can you see them from where you are?

170
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:33,158
-Yeah.
-Then put a bullet in their heads.

171
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,734
-They're being watched.
-I don 't care.

172
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:37,891
By armed guards.

173
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,506
They make it back to Fox River,
it is over for all of us.

174
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,802
Not much more this country loves
than a bad man with a good story.

175
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,411
How much longer do you think
it'll be before someone...

176
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,572
-...puts a microphone in front of them?
-Hey, are you listening?

177
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,208
With the security here, what you're asking
me to do is tantamount to suicide.

178
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,652
-Do you understand what I'm saying?
-I wasn't asking anything.

179
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,223
That would imply
you had a say in the matter.

180
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,964
Pull this off and you
are halfway home, Alex.

181
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,397
You remember what home is like,
don't you?

182
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,833
90 West End Avenue.
White fence, red door.

183
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,700
You stay away from my family.

184
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,523
You got a little something on your....

185
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,335
No. Here, let me.

186
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,134
I'm so--

187
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,602
-Pardon my forwardness. I--
-It's okay. Thank you.

188
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,142
Normally, I wouldn't intervene.

189
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:30,681
It's just, yesterday when I was--
I got home from work...

190
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,648
...I found what looked like
the Brazilian rain forest...

191
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,616
...Iodged between my two front teeth.

192
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:40,852
And all I could think about was the number
of people who must've seen, and not....

193
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,517
Not a damn one of them
had the decency to tell me.

194
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,598
Mild diastema.

195
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,264
Excuse me?

196
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,969
It's a slight gap
between your eight and nine.

197
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,301
Your two front teeth.

198
00:12:56,475 --> 00:13:00,241
And that it sometimes can act
as a magnet for food...

199
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,371
...Iike broccoli and tuna,
and sometimes rice.

200
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,017
Or relish.

201
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,050
All this and brains too?

202
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,849
-What are you a dentist or a...?
-Me? No. Hardly, no.

203
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,514
I could never.

204
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,525
-My ex. My ex-husband, he was--
-A bastard?

205
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,658
That too.

206
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,804
Have you ever been to ltaly...?

207
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:35,510
-Denise.
-Denise. That's a lovely name.

208
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:44,052
You know, in ltaly they have wine
every day with lunch.

209
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,319
And what do we do in this country?
We power our food down...

210
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,758
...with caffeine, carbonation
and high-fructose corn syrup.

211
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,560
No one ever takes the time
to enjoy things anymore.

212
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,665
Denise, would you do me the honor...

213
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:06,869
...of enjoying the rest of your lunch
with me?

214
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,841
I think I'd like that.

215
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,045
White or red?

216
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,386
And with limited financial resources,
he poses no flight risk--

217
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,860
Unless he'd rather not stand trial
for capital murder.

218
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,157
The defendant has shown
great resourcefulness...

219
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,930
...in being able to travel across country
with little money.

220
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,938
There's no reason
he couldn't do it again.

221
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,805
If you don't want to believe me,
believe Mr. Bellick.

222
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,747
You thieving son of a bitch.

223
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,612
You better get down on your knees
and pray I never find you.

224
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:51,882
Because if I do, mark my words,
I will gut you, bow to stern.

225
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:59,330
He promised to kill Mr. Geary,
and then he kept that promise.

226
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:04,333
A man like the defendant
should not be out in society.

227
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,771
I concur. Bail denied.

228
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,667
Who would that be?

229
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,106
Only one person.

230
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,037
Michael, it's me.
Listen, this phone rang last night...

231
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,740
...and I went to answer it,
but I couldn't hear anything.

232
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,886
And I wonder if maybe it was you.

233
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,717
I don't know what I should do,
if I should leave a message...

234
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,187
...or who might be listening.

235
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:39,554
I need to know that you're okay.
I need you to know that I'm not.

236
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,190
I didn't leave you in Gila.
Something happened to me and I don't....

237
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,404
I don't know what to do.
I'm not too sure where to go...

238
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:50,736
...but I know that you're the only person
I can trust, and I need you to....

239
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,742
I need you to be okay, and....

240
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,345
And I need you. Please.

241
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,194
Stand by to receive
Border Patrol transport.

242
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,601
Incoming prisoners. Stand by.

243
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,433
Yes, sir.

244
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,917
Alexander Mahone, Bureau.

245
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,628
These are my prisoners,
and I will be personally escorting them...

246
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,731
-...in their transfer vehicle.
-You can follow in a chase car.

247
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,799
I don't believe you heard me.

248
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,798
I'll be accompanying them in their tran--

249
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,564
The only people allowed in the van
are the driver and two guards...

250
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,937
...who've been trained and certified
in prisoner transport.

251
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:04,073
Are you really gonna make me
go over your head?

252
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,677
I'll even dial the phone for you.

253
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,654
This is standard procedure,
Agent Mahone.

254
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,518
We need to keep that environment
as controllable as possible.

255
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,854
The more bodies, the less control.

256
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,762
These men may have knowledge
of the location of the other escapees.

257
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,262
This is knowledge that l....

258
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,902
I need to do my job.

259
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,267
And my job is to ensure
the safe and successful transfer...

260
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,930
...of these two prisoners.

261
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,476
The chase vehicles are right outside.

262
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,313
We're coming to you live
from the Border Patrol facility...

263
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,922
...in Alamogordo, New Mexico,
where Lincoln Burrows...

264
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,354
...and Michael Scofield
are being transferred--

265
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,120
There better be a good reason
why those brothers are alive.

266
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,126
Bad day, Bill?

267
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:56,299
Sorry, I thought this was someone
who still existed.

268
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,528
-How's the jerky business, Owen?
-It's looking good right about now.

269
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,131
You call this number again,
you're a dead man.

270
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,832
You don't kill Burrows and Scofield today,
so are you.

271
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,377
You know it and I know it, and luckily
for you, I know how to save your ass.

272
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,776
The brothers are already
being transferred.

273
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,315
You're too late.

274
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,754
Actually, the transport van is exactly
where you want them to be, Bill.

275
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,892
-Why?
-Why?

276
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,054
You want my help, Bill?
I want my job back.

277
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,063
That means direct access
to the president.

278
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,965
-I report only to her.
-You ' re reaching, Paul. Goodbye.

279
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,868
Don 't shut me out, Bill.
You think Burrows and Scofield...

280
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,703
...are a threat to this administration?
I know everything...

281
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:42,176
... Caroline Reynolds has ever done.
Everything.

282
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,975
Now, before you panic, all I am asking...

283
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,675
...is to be allowed to finish the job
that I started.

284
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,912
To prove to the president and to you...

285
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,024
...that I am still an asset
to this administration.

286
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,885
What's your plan?

287
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,700
I have an old associate in the Illinois DOC.
They're heading up the transfer.

288
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,166
It's gonna take more than one guy
on the inside.

289
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,965
Not if the guy's in the right place.

290
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,900
Bill, you give me the go-ahead on this
and those brothers get in the van...

291
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,238
...it'll be the last thing they ever do.

292
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:44,667
I have never done that before.

293
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,343
Then I guess we was making up
for some lost time.

294
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,121
I have to ask, Sam,
are you married or something?

295
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,450
Me? No.

296
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,252
-What makes you think--?
-Come on.

297
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,155
I may be plain, but I'm not a fool.

298
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,991
Usually, the men I end up with
are just looking for something, you know...

299
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,099
...on the side.

300
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,996
Denise, the only side I'm interested in...

301
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,297
...is the inside.

302
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,602
And that place within you...

303
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,108
...is not plain.

304
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,047
-I have to get back to work.
-Do you really?

305
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,345
I have to close tonight.

306
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,218
How about I pick you up after?

307
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,086
We can have dinner.

308
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,386
-Are you sure?
-Denise.

309
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,359
I insist.

310
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,578
-Yeah?
-Good news.

311
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,409
You're off the hook.

312
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,280
Paul Kellerman has a team ready to move
on the caravan just outside of Albuquerque.

313
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,649
Okay, so where does that leave us?

314
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,088
When it goes down, there's sure
to be a moment or two of chaos.

315
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,696
A certain amount of confusion,
lots of bullets flying....

316
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,362
I need you there to make sure
Paul Kellerman catches one.

317
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,663
A little early to be covering your tracks,
isn't it?

318
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,705
The escapees, that was our deal.

319
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,437
-That's all.
-Right.

320
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,376
Our deal.

321
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:35,617
Refresh my memory. Was our deal supposed
to end with Burrows and Scofield...

322
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,688
...going back to prison,
or bleeding from a hole in their heads?

323
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,625
We're giving you a chance
to make this right, Alex.

324
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:47,294
Just let Kellerman take care of it.
Let him be our Oswald.

325
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,024
And that makes me your Jack Ruby.

326
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,032
Jack Ruby was working alone.

327
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,037
You've got the support of the United States
government behind you, Alex.

328
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,702
Good luck in Albuquerque.

329
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,779
I promise, sir, this'll all be over shortly.

330
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,422
And it'll be back to business as usual.

331
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,960
-Do you regret it?
-What?

332
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:24,900
Knowing what you know now,
do you regret helping me?

333
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,135
You'd have done the same thing for me.

334
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,933
-You think?
-I know.

335
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,479
You didn't answer the question.

336
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,182
I don't regret the act.

337
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,248
Just how it turned out.

338
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,251
We've got a premeditated murder
on our hands.

339
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,556
You wanted to steal money
then kill the witness.

340
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,564
Are you my attorney or theirs?
I told you, I didn't do anything.

341
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,202
No, I'm just explaining their theory
of what happened.

342
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,930
Your explanation to the cops
that you didn't kill Geary...

343
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:05,304
...because you were too busy trying to steal
5 million in federally insured money?

344
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,342
Probably not the best move.

345
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,106
-But there is good news.
-What's that?

346
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,379
The DA is willing to offer a deal.

347
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,576
-Twenty-five years.
-No.

348
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,848
Brad, they'll drop the capital charge.
No death penalty.

349
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,651
No!

350
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:24,262
-I'll be almost 65 when I get out.
-But you'd get out.

351
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,989
If this case goes to trial,
there's an excellent chance...

352
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,689
...you're sentenced to death.

353
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,194
Now, I've been doing this a while,
and I can tell you.

354
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,338
These things never go down good.

355
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,834
When the system wants you,
they get you, one way or another.

356
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:49,544
Part of the deal's gotta be
I do my time in lllinois.

357
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,889
So I can be near my mom.

358
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:13,873
Where are they taking us?

359
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,478
Another foster home.

360
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,842
I don't wanna go. I liked it there.

361
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,506
I know you did.

362
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,847
It's because of you,
the reason they're making us move?

363
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:27,424
-Because you were getting in trouble again?
-Yeah, and I'm sorry.

364
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,259
Seems like I've been dragging you
in trouble my whole life.

365
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,596
Pulled me out of some too.

366
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,131
Yeah.

367
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,624
-Yeah?
-Alex, Paul Kellerman.

368
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,462
-Have you spoken with Bill Kim?
- Yeah.

369
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,667
Yeah, he filled me in.
You're staging in Albuquerque.

370
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,273
Listen, me jumping in at this point.

371
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,605
It in no way reflects my feelings
about the job you've been doing.

372
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,644
I just wanted you to know that.

373
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,673
Of course.

374
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:26,973
So long as we get the job done.

375
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,646
We all get to go back
to our families, right?

376
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,088
The sooner the better.

377
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,589
So, what do I need to know?

378
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,987
As we first reported last night,
after nine days on the run...

379
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,689
...fugitives Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield...

380
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,358
... two of the masterminds behind
the desperate Fox River Eight escape...

381
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:49,029
... were apprehended by Border Patrol
officials near the Mexican border...

382
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:52,608
...and are being transferred back
to Fox River Penitentiary today.

383
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,972
Officials say Burrows,
who was scheduled to die...

384
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,808
...for the murder of Reynolds ' brother,
Terrence Steadman...

385
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:02,147
...could have his execution date rescheduled
for as early as late next week.

386
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,447
With the number of felonies
the pair now face...

387
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,648
...Burrows ' brother, Michael Scofield--

388
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,396
-What' s going on?
-Let me go check.

389
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,376
-What do you see?
-I ' ll let you know.

390
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,939
How much time is it gonna take
to move this?

391
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,176
I've got my men working on it now.

392
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,895
-What's going on up there?
-Are you in a hurry?

393
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,062
Hey, we need some help
getting this rig out of the road.

394
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,499
Linc.

395
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,006
Come on.

396
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,782
All right, let's say we get the cuffs off.
Where do we go?

397
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,290
-There.
-That's too easy.

398
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,596
Come on. Come on, Michael, take it.

399
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,262
Come on. Come on.

400
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,935
Take it.

401
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,101
Take it and run.

402
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:28,290
Let's think about this.
The keys are accidentally left out.

403
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,491
The door is accidentally left open.

404
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,966
-It's our only shot.
-It's their only shot.

405
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,436
They don't have an excuse
unless we give it to them.

406
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,632
-How we doing?
-Nothing so far.

407
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,040
-None?
-They're talking, that's all.

408
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:45,007
They haven't bitten in five minutes,
you pull the semi, you tell them it's fixed.

409
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,878
-You release traffic.
-And do what?

410
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,815
You want the rabbit to hop,
move the carrot, Alex.

411
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,401
You showed.

412
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,702
A gentleman always does.

413
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,845
Where are we going to eat?

414
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,642
Wherever your heart desires.

415
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:24,184
You know, there's just one teensy-tiny thing
I've been meaning to ask.

416
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,184
Anything.

417
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,355
You know, forwarding addresses
are supposed to be confidential.

418
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,056
I really shouldn't be doing this.

419
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:41,171
Well, you shouldn't have been doing
a lot of things we did this afternoon...

420
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,240
...but neither of us
has been "smited" down yet.

421
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,502
There she is.

422
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,580
I'd imagine your cousin'll be pretty surprised
to hear about the money her uncle left her.

423
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,946
You can be certain of it.

424
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,982
Sam, I hope you don't mind me asking,
but....

425
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,689
Your hand...

426
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,657
...what happened to it?

427
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,900
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna make you
feel uncomfortable or nothing. I just....

428
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,806
I wanna know you.

429
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,434
I wanna know everything
about you...

430
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:23,107
...and if this is a part of who you are,
then I want to know how it....

431
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,217
Oh, dear God.

432
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,064
I really wish you hadn't seen that.

433
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,320
Here's what I'm thinking.
You and some of the boys...

434
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,186
...get yourself transferred to ad seg.

435
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,260
We can spend our days playing Scrabble
and watching SportsCenter.

436
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,363
-Look, captain--
-Then in a year and half...

437
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,829
...you recommend me for
those work-release programs.

438
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,833
I can sweat off the rest of my time
heaving hay and getting sun.

439
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,130
-That's why--
-lt ain't freedom, but it's close.

440
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,137
Is that why you requested
to be sent here?

441
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,368
Oh, I go anywhere else as a former C.O.,
I'm a dead man.

442
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,971
Here, I got men to watch my back,
get me the finest accommodations--

443
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,584
-They're not putting you in ad seg.
-I don't care where they're putting me...

444
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,049
-...take me to ad seg.
-It's not like it used to be.

445
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,620
-C.O.'s don't run the game anymore.
-What do you mean?

446
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,452
This new warden.
He's cracking down to prove he's serious...

447
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,890
...about showing preferential treatment.

448
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,789
He's making an example out of you.

449
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,134
Lou, what the hell is this?

450
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,598
Gen pop.

451
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,580
Welcome home, boss.

452
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,646
Okay, everybody, we're moving out.

453
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,999
Window's closing, Michael,
once the truck moves....

454
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,334
If we run now, we give them permission
to put a bullet in our heads.

455
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,238
We stay, I'm dead within the week.
You're locked up for life.

456
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,709
Or until they find a way to get to you,
and believe me they will.

457
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,712
If we go to prison,
we'll have a few days.

458
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,714
We'll have a chance to contact Sara.

459
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,250
We don't know where Sara is.

460
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,750
Sara may be dead, Michael.

461
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,719
Let me get us out of here
the only way I know how.

462
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,456
-Fighting?
-Yeah.

463
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,365
Get the keys.

464
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,843
-Here we go. Here we go.
-Copy that.

465
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,576
All right, we're on.

466
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,840
Heads up. Hold traffic.

467
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,219
Hold all traffic. Okay.

468
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,028
We have no idea
what's behind that door.

469
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,091
Nope.

470
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,472
-You ready?
-No. You?

471
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,970
No.

472
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,066
Let's go.

473
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,974
Get it open. Kick it open. Go.

474
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,511
All men to the tunnel!

475
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,651
Just pray there's another way
out of here.

476
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,302
This way.

477
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,842
Yeah, they're in,
and they're heading straight for you.

478
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,918
-Armed?
-No.

479
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,351
-Where are you? I'll back you up.
-Keep moving.

480
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:49,391
As long as they're running from you, they're
running towards me. They are boxed in.

481
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,993
Yeah.

482
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,018
Oh, hold on one sec.

483
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,420
Could I write a check for the food,
because I don't have--

484
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,257
Hello, Mrs. Hollander.

485
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,366
They say a good woman is hard to find.

486
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,937
Well, if that's true,
you must be very, very...

487
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,631
...very good.

488
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:38,900
Don't be frightened.

489
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,080
Teddy's home.

490
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,546
This way.

491
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,356
They're improvising,
heading toward the surface.

492
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,340
-Where to?
-I don't know.

493
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,103
Look, if something happens to us...

494
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,807
...if we get separated, if one of us
doesn't make it, promise you'll find Sara.

495
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,352
-We're gonna make it.
-Just promise me.

496
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,543
I promise. Come on.

497
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,607
President Reynolds ruined your life.
She ruined my life.

498
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,918
If you wanna take the bitch down,
you just found your inside man...

499
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,814
...but it's gotta be right now.

500
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:41,253
Let's go! Now!

501
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,196
