1
00:00:01,183 --> 00:00:02,377
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:04,793
Excuse me, Iadies.
I need to ask you a few questions.

3
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:08,162
And that dirty Southerner,
he snuck out the back.

4
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:10,489
Do you really think
the Diaper Sniper got all of it?

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,858
If you were Bagwell and you just
got your hands on $5 million...

6
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,115
...where would you go?

7
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:17,359
I'm right in the city.
In the Rainbow Room.

8
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:18,667
Restaurant in New York City.

9
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:21,911
I am gonna be waiting in that spot.

10
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:25,340
And that's all that I want
in this whole world...

11
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,071
...is for my two girls
to be waiting there for me.

12
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:38,746
Three dots, third Ietter.

13
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:41,430
Rendezvous.

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,467
The question is, where?

15
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,175
Sundown, hot.

16
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,338
What? What are you trying
to tell me, Michael?

17
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:51,257
I think I owe you an apology
because I Iied to you...

18
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:53,908
...about Oscar Shales.

19
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:56,599
Right there.

20
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:58,652
That's where I put the bullet in him.

21
00:01:00,447 --> 00:01:01,675
What are you doing, man?

22
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:07,359
You've been hired to do a job.
The reasoning does not concern you.

23
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,917
Don't ask any questions about us...

24
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:11,548
...we'II continue to make sure
no one asks any about you.

25
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,082
Are we clear?

26
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:16,299
They all die.

27
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:51,248
-Hey.
-Hey.

28
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:53,058
Are you new?

29
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,987
Yeah.

30
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:57,503
No one told me
we were getting a new volunteer.

31
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:01,333
I've been working, the night shifts.
CIean up.

32
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,029
And Jimmy said
I could change my shift, so....

33
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:05,561
You know what you're doing?

34
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,346
Yeah.

35
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,956
-I'II see you around.
-Right.

36
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:10,411
-This might be Scofield.
-Copy that.

37
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:44,299
You take that side.

38
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,315
-Freeze!
-Take it easy, man.

39
00:04:20,383 --> 00:04:22,476
-Stay on the ground.
-What's the deal?

40
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:25,689
He's gone.

41
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:33,386
-How you feeling?
-Okay, I guess.

42
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,634
Tired.

43
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:38,892
I'm a target, kid.

44
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:40,704
As Iong as you're with me, so are you.

45
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,612
Things will get a whole Iot worse
before they get better. Understand?

46
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,903
After we meet up with Uncle Mike
and get to Panama.

47
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,237
Panama ain't a sure thing.

48
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:50,911
Your uncle's plan is dangerous.
I mean, really dangerous.

49
00:04:53,214 --> 00:04:57,116
Listen, all the charges against you
have been dropped.

50
00:04:57,119 --> 00:05:00,452
You're free and clear to start a new Iife.
A good Iife.

51
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,413
Not be running,
Iooking over your shoulder--

52
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:03,826
You want me to Ieave?

53
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:08,053
No.

54
00:05:10,975 --> 00:05:15,207
-No.
-Good, because I'm not.

55
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:23,606
Here you go.

56
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:27,867
Turn the sound up on the tube, Jenny.

57
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:29,365
Sure, Hank.

58
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:32,663
Do you have any thoughts
on the death of David Apolskis?

59
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:35,979
-It was unfortunate.
-Tests show he was shot at close range.

60
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:38,499
-David.
-Was there ever any opportunity--?

61
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:41,722
Let me remind you that despite his age,
David "Tweener" Apolskis was...

62
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,989
...a fugitive who made a move
for my weapon.

63
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:47,376
I did not want to have to kill him.

64
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:49,946
Sometimes things happen
that are just out of your control.

65
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,697
That good old boy's
hunting them all down, ain't he?

66
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,565
Sources claim that you have
recovered Scofield's hard drive.

67
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:58,105
-Obtained substantial data from it.
-What sources?

68
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:01,167
Retrieved information detailing
not only how Scofield broke out...

69
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:03,375
-... but how he plans to stay out. Comment?
-No.

70
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:06,219
The event at Blanding Botanical Gardens
earlier today...

71
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,398
...that was a result
of hard drive data you collected.

72
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,838
No comment.

73
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,377
Have you found other locations
where Scofield might be?

74
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,431
-I believe I said no comment.
-There's something about this guy.

75
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,379
It's like he knows where we're going,
what we're thinking.

76
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:22,586
-Tell us where you're heading.
-What role will the hard drive play?

77
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,638
Details of this investigation
are extremely confidential.

78
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,279
Heard it came back from the Iab.
Any findings?

79
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:32,107
Yeah, 3200 nitroglycerine ampoules.

80
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,754
Scofield knew these needed to be
stored in a cool, moist area.

81
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:38,743
Best place for that in the Utah desert
is the botanical gardens.

82
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:40,751
-Stable?
-AII medical grade.

83
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,991
Safely used by heart patients
all the time.

84
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,299
But in the aggregate--

85
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:47,872
It can take out an entire building.
That box right there.

86
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:53,183
This is why we can't have Ieaks...

87
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,117
...coming from this office.

88
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:58,742
God help the agent
who goes behind my back...

89
00:06:58,814 --> 00:07:01,339
...and talks to the press.

90
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,553
Can you elaborate on any of your
tactics in this manhunt?

91
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:14,891
Sun Tzu said that if you know
your enemy...

92
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,465
...you need not fear 1 00 battles.

93
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:19,043
I know these men, who they are,
where they came from.

94
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:21,037
Where they want to go.

95
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:27,257
These convicts are in a constant battle.

96
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:30,348
Not only with me...

97
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,971
...but with themselves.

98
00:07:35,198 --> 00:07:37,393
Second-guessing
every decision they make.

99
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:42,202
Do I turn left?

100
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,686
Do I turn right?

101
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,496
Stay or go?

102
00:07:50,014 --> 00:07:52,744
My job is to know
how they'll answer these questions.

103
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:57,133
The only way to win a war
is to try to know your prey completely.

104
00:07:57,182 --> 00:08:00,583
And then you get to go after
your enemy with everything you've got.

105
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:05,763
Season 2
Episode 9
Unearthed

106
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:40,751
Our half price stuff's in the back.

107
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,664
-I'm Iooking for something very specific.
-Okay.

108
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,535
This is it.

109
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:54,721
-This is exactly what I need.
-Great.

110
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,865
We were just inches away today.
Inches.

111
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,097
I want these blown up huge.

112
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:03,740
-Put them up in my office, on the walls.
-What are these?

113
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:06,867
In there is information regarding
a rendezvous that Scofield set up.

114
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,639
We're gonna crack that code today.
Lang!

115
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:11,897
Today's the day Franklin told his wife
he'II meet her at the Rainbow Room.

116
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,267
-Right.
-Wrong. Today Franklin's going down.

117
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:16,768
-Are you ready?
-Everything's arranged.

118
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:37,341
-It's all here?
-Yeah.

119
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:42,825
Yo, Ray, Iet's go.

120
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,544
Hey, yo, Trey. What's up, nigga?

121
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:50,278
-I know that ain't you.
-It ain't a ghost, man.

122
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:51,659
You holding up all right?

123
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:54,937
Just catching a whole bunch of buses
just to get here to Chi-Town, man.

124
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:57,306
How you think I'm supposed to feel?

125
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:59,924
Chris, Jay.
What's up, FIam?

126
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,523
You Iook Iike you Iost a few, bro.

127
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,121
-SIim-Fast, baby.
-Is that what it is?

128
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:07,456
Feds been in your old Iady's business,
no joke. Up in your crib.

129
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:09,579
-Following her around.
-Yeah, I know, man.

130
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:10,856
Yo, I know you Iove Kacee.

131
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:13,807
I don't know if it's a good idea
for you to come around here.

132
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:14,843
You're a wanted man.

133
00:10:14,974 --> 00:10:16,703
I'm wanted because I kept
my mouth shut.

134
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:18,356
And I kept you out of Fox River.

135
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:20,953
C-Man, we feel that.
And we owe you one.

136
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,690
Good, because I'm collecting right now.

137
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:26,579
My wife is waiting for me...

138
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:29,655
...and I am not Ieaving Chi-town
without my family, you understand?

139
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:33,358
Now, you all are gonna help me.
Let's roll out.

140
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:47,733
Where you going?

141
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:52,165
To take my kid to school.

142
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:53,983
I know about the Rainbow Room.

143
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:56,979
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Phone Iines are tapped.

144
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:59,320
We heard your entire conversation
with your husband.

145
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,154
Since you and Dede aren't booked
on any flights to New York...

146
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:05,039
...don't tell me the Rainbow Room
is a restaurant in Manhattan.

147
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:06,986
Tell me where you're meeting
your husband.

148
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,506
Or I can arrest you.
Right in front of your daughter.

149
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:14,421
You go to hell.
I haven't done anything wrong.

150
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:19,176
You spoke with an escaped felon
about meeting him today.

151
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,994
You've done enough to be charged
with attempt to aid and abet.

152
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,743
PIease, okay. Listen to me.

153
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:26,698
One phone call
and Child Welfare is here.

154
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:29,273
You're going to County,
Dede will be in foster care.

155
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:30,331
-No.
-Don't worry.

156
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:33,761
I hear the families
in the foster system are topnotch.

157
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:43,165
You are asking me to choose
between my daughter and my husband.

158
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,093
Exactly.

159
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,683
-Anything?
-I'm on the phone with Fox River...

160
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:50,495
...checking T-Bag's file.

161
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,162
Hey, what you got for me?

162
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:59,300
Really, 52 times? Where?

163
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:04,727
I owe you, Patterson.

164
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:08,187
We got a Iot of road to cover.

165
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:28,500
We're good.

166
00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:37,342
No more stops
until we get to New Mexico.

167
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,517
-You forgot your change.
-Yeah.

168
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:43,065
-Thanks.
-You were in such a rush.

169
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,134
Thanks. Thank you.

170
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:51,065
Keep walking. Keep walking.

171
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,415
Come on, keep walking.

172
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,842
Damn it.

173
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:09,144
We don't have to ditch the car.
We can keep driving.

174
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:12,981
We can't, the waitress
made me and the car. It's useless.

175
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,944
I'm sorry, you know.
Maybe we can find another car.

176
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:18,982
Cars aren't exactly
growing on trees out here.

177
00:13:19,071 --> 00:13:21,505
We've got 400 miles to go,
and no way of getting there.

178
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:24,262
If we don't get to Michael in time,
he'II Ieave without us.

179
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:26,446
-He wouldn't do that.
-He doesn't have a choice.

180
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:28,323
It's a one-shot deal out of the country.

181
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,661
I said I was sorry.

182
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:34,112
-There was a sign for a train station.
-It ain't that easy.

183
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:36,871
-We follow the road, we won't be seen.
-It ain't that easy.

184
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,253
Hey, I'm not an idiot.
I was on the run too, you know.

185
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:46,818
Yeah, you were on the run,
and you got caught.

186
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:50,949
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I'm not a pro
at being a con Iike you, Dad.

187
00:13:50,974 --> 00:13:54,410
Maybe I should've just Ieft
when you gave me the out.

188
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,455
Not Iike you care.

189
00:13:57,022 --> 00:13:58,785
Take it easy.

190
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:03,402
I'm sorry, all right?

191
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:11,852
I'm sorry, man, I'm just....

192
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:15,978
Let's get out of here.

193
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:30,154
-Mrs. Pamela Mahone?
-Yes.

194
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:32,142
Agent Wayne Merrick, FBI.

195
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:34,690
I'd Iike to talk to you
about your husband.

196
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:47,518
I'm surprised that you're coming to me
for a background check on AIex.

197
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:48,746
It's standard procedure.

198
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:51,922
We run these kind of checks when
an agent's about to be promoted...

199
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:53,524
...to a higher security clearance.

200
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,531
I know that, I did this dance
the Iast time he was promoted.

201
00:14:56,574 --> 00:14:58,565
I just figured that
since we were divorced....

202
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:01,851
I mean, I rarely speak to him,
and I certainly don't follow his career--

203
00:15:01,886 --> 00:15:03,615
We really need to get this done today.

204
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:07,545
So, I promise
I won't take up much of your time.

205
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:10,952
I've given enough time
to my ex-husband, Mr. Merrick.

206
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,077
I see.

207
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:17,416
The Bureau can take its toll
on your family.

208
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,165
I understand that.

209
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:22,129
My ex-wife is, an agent...

210
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:26,076
...and Iet's just say
I know how you feel.

211
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,487
Promise me
that he won't find out we spoke?

212
00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:35,055
Oh, it's totally confidential.

213
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:41,073
-Do you mind if I ask why?
-To be perfectly honest, he scares me.

214
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,428
Information.

215
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:17,083
Hi, I need the number
for a Sundown Hotel please.

216
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,617
-What state?
-AII of them, please.

217
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:20,982
-Got one in Pierre, South Dakota.
-Okay.

218
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:24,455
Another in Sutton, West Virginia.
And one in Gila, New Mexico.

219
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,519
-What can I do you for?
-A batch of them sunflowers, please.

220
00:17:02,558 --> 00:17:03,889
If you don ' t mind me saying...

221
00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:05,989
...you do not sound Iike
you hail from Kansas.

222
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:07,409
You got a sharp ear.

223
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:12,190
I hail from what we call
the Yellowhammer State.

224
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,181
What brings you to Tribune?

225
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:21,553
Sir?

226
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,652
Romance.

227
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:28,965
Thank you so much.

228
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:36,394
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

229
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:38,757
Feds gonna be swinging
bigger bats than these.

230
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:41,337
-We gotta have ours.
-Look, man, that's all we need.

231
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:44,671
Is your car, your truck,
and some guts, man.

232
00:17:44,702 --> 00:17:45,999
We don't need all of this.

233
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,510
-Maybe we should think about it.
-I said no.

234
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,601
What's gonna happen, man,
when the bullets start flying?

235
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,797
Can you guarantee
my family ain't gonna get hurt?

236
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:57,438
Johnny Law's gonna be strapped up.
I'm going in hot.

237
00:17:57,502 --> 00:18:00,300
-I don't think you heard me.
-No, I don't think you heard me.

238
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,341
I'm not going in naked.

239
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,762
I know we said
we'd ride with you on this...

240
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,196
...but I'm not going in there
without some of these.

241
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:17,974
You wanna punk out, man?

242
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:21,878
Then punk out,
because I can do this myself.

243
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:27,265
Ain't nobody punking out. And no guns.

244
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:35,987
But you better be right about this,
if bullets do start flying...

245
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,225
...the only blood being spilt
is gonna be ours.

246
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:40,279
You feel me?

247
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:42,811
I feel you.

248
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:47,289
Agent Kellerman!

249
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,153
-Agent Kellerman!
-Yes?

250
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:51,305
That name you wanted me to track.
Kelli Foster.

251
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:54,765
She booked a flight to New Mexico.
Just Ianded.

252
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:57,713
-Got someone on her?
-No, but we got an ID on her rental car.

253
00:18:57,758 --> 00:19:01,319
-Should I update Mr. Kim?
-No, I'II take care of this myself.

254
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:08,112
We got a tip from a waitress who
thinks she saw Burrows and his son.

255
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:11,286
-Outside St. David, Arizona.
-Get a road team out there to confirm.

256
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:13,794
Once they get a beat on Burrows,
notify me immediately.

257
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:15,981
Everybody out. Let's go, come on.

258
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,316
Yeah?

259
00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:24,339
Sara Tancredi just booked
a one-way ticket across the country.

260
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:28,775
-To where?
-New Mexico.

261
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:32,478
Of course.

262
00:19:32,574 --> 00:19:35,134
-Any Iuck breaking that code?
-Not yet.

263
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:37,393
-But this helps.
-Good.

264
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,251
-Wheeler!
-Sir?

265
00:19:47,294 --> 00:19:49,626
Every combination that has NM in it.

266
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:53,493
I want you to check it to see if
it contains a Iocation in New Mexico.

267
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:54,730
-I want it done now.
-Now?

268
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,437
Yeah, right now.

269
00:19:58,654 --> 00:20:00,121
So how well do you know Alex?

270
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:02,213
He knows me better than I know him.

271
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:06,462
He's a closed book, all right.
But he wasn't always Iike that.

272
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:09,693
In the first few years of our marriage...

273
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:13,594
...he was actually romantic.

274
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:20,050
And then one day, out of nowhere....

275
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,781
-Out of nowhere, what?
-Everything changed.

276
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:30,910
-He became obsessed with getting out.
-Out of the marriage?

277
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,605
Getting out of the marriage.

278
00:20:32,702 --> 00:20:35,296
Getting me out of the house,
out of his Iife.

279
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,519
He Ieft me.

280
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:40,546
He Ieft the both of us.

281
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,249
You said you were scared of him.
Why is that?

282
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,949
He started acting strange.

283
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,966
Started spending all of his time
in the backyard gardening, of all things.

284
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:53,433
I mean, the man was a neat freak.

285
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:56,799
He'd throw away a pair of shoes
if they even got scuffed.

286
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,264
But he'd be out there,
all covered in dirt...

287
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:03,646
...and surrounded by these huge bags
of fertilizer and Iye.

288
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:07,343
We just put this new sod in,
and he just tore it all up...

289
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:09,450
...and planted a flower bed.

290
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:11,398
And I went out back once to talk to him.

291
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:14,944
And he screamed at me...

292
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:18,637
...and said not to come near the garden.

293
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,747
Said that it was his.

294
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:28,015
I'm sorry. If you--
If you wanna take a break.

295
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:32,262
AII I wanted was an explanation
why things ended so suddenly.

296
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:34,949
And all AIex could say was:

297
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,632
"Sometimes things happen
that are just out of your control."

298
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,015
So the picture
in your daughter's bedroom.

299
00:22:07,102 --> 00:22:10,629
The exact Iocation where it was taken
was a merry-go-round, right?

300
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,881
Yeah.

301
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:15,184
AII you have to do
is wait by the merry-go-round.

302
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:17,580
Right where Benjamin's expecting you.

303
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:21,700
Is that necessary?

304
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:24,690
-I mean, Benjamin's not even--
-It's precautionary.

305
00:22:27,582 --> 00:22:32,713
Look, I do this,
you Ieave me and my child alone.

306
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:35,179
You have my word.

307
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:57,673
Is my wife there?

308
00:22:58,142 --> 00:23:01,407
-Yeah, she's here.
-Well, let's go get her.

309
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:15,447
Number three, please confirm
you're in position, number one.

310
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:32,638
In 1 5 seconds a black jeep is gonna
pull up by the parking Iot entrance.

311
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:33,866
Run to it.

312
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,202
Chris?

313
00:23:40,382 --> 00:23:41,781
Go!

314
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:45,908
-I can't, they're gonna take Dede.
-No, they won't.

315
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,549
Is that guy talking to her?
Get a read on him.

316
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:51,162
-Move to positions.
-It's taken care of. Go!

317
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:57,839
Go!

318
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:04,623
She's running. She's running.

319
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,962
Go, go, go! Move, move!

320
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:21,453
Get in! Hold on.

321
00:24:32,158 --> 00:24:35,184
It's a 2007 black Jeep.
License plates have been removed.

322
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:37,094
We're in pursuit, headed-- No!

323
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,549
Move the truck.

324
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,553
Move the truck.

325
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:50,731
I said move it!

326
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:58,438
-Where is my child?
-Here.

327
00:24:59,677 --> 00:25:01,872
-Dede?
-Hey, it's me, baby.

328
00:25:02,238 --> 00:25:06,231
Hey, Iook, I just wanna tell you
that everything is gonna be okay.

329
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,433
We're gonna be a family again,
I promise you that.

330
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,740
Where is Dede?
He said that you had her!

331
00:25:10,814 --> 00:25:12,372
No, no, no, no, no. Be easy, baby.

332
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:16,436
Be easy. Trey is picking her up
from school right now.

333
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,600
Dede Franklin, Dawson EIementary.
I want her pulled from school, now.

334
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:25,555
-What the hell is going on, man?
-They say she's taking a test, man.

335
00:25:25,597 --> 00:25:27,394
But I think they're stalling.

336
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:35,390
What about Oscar Shales?

337
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,257
Oscar Shales? Why is he important?

338
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:47,069
Well, he's just the only fugitive
to ever successfully elude...

339
00:25:47,069 --> 00:25:48,627
...your ex-husband.

340
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:51,395
AIex was consumed with finding him.

341
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:54,685
I mean, after what Shales did to all
of his victims, who could blame him?

342
00:25:54,717 --> 00:25:57,914
It was all he worked on,
all he did for a year.

343
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,296
But I don't think that it was the stress
of chasing Shales...

344
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:03,606
...that caused AIex
to start behaving erratically.

345
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:05,111
Why is that?

346
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:08,114
Because AIex changed
after the trail went cold.

347
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,453
I remember it Iike it was yesterday.

348
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:16,326
He just walked into the kitchen,
after 1 2 years of marriage...

349
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:19,544
...and says that he wanted me
out of the house immediately.

350
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:22,415
I'II never forget the date.

351
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:24,654
It was June 1 5th.

352
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:28,602
I think I have everything I need.

353
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:32,159
You didn't even ask
about social history or education.

354
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:34,817
-That's standard in these checks.
-That's been handled.

355
00:26:34,877 --> 00:26:38,779
I have to get these reports filed
with Strategic Operations, ASAP.

356
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:41,808
-You're with Strategic Operations?
-They handle these checks.

357
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:45,520
Not since the 9/1 1 realignment,
Mr. Merrick.

358
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:48,262
The chief information officer
does them now.

359
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:50,796
They handled AIex's Iast check.

360
00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:55,795
When an agent reaches a Ievel
as high as your ex-husband's...

361
00:26:55,837 --> 00:26:58,169
...S.O. takes over...again.

362
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:02,749
Bureaucracies. Thank you for the coffee.

363
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:12,473
Look, just get her out of there.

364
00:27:14,141 --> 00:27:15,802
They're here.

365
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:18,833
No, no, no, no.

366
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,324
-No, see, we gotta go.
-Don't worry about it.

367
00:27:24,414 --> 00:27:26,507
Just get the car started, all right? Go.

368
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:39,248
-Daddy!
-Hey, baby.

369
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:41,444
-You ready to go?
-Where are we going?

370
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:44,832
-Disneyland.
-Mr. Franklin, you can't....

371
00:27:44,861 --> 00:27:47,295
-FBI, stop!
-Get him, get him!

372
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:53,779
Come on, Iet's go!

373
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:55,250
Let's go, baby. Let's go, baby.

374
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:57,052
Come on, go, go, go!

375
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:01,954
Franklin has the child!
Repeat, Franklin has the child!

376
00:28:09,469 --> 00:28:11,596
Evening, Mrs. Hollander.

377
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:13,440
Don 't you look lovely this evening?

378
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:18,013
You should've told me what you were.
My God, I Iet you near my children!

379
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:21,574
Don't think I won't remember
what your front steps Iook Iike.

380
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:19,597
Come on now, get away from the road.
You wanna get caught?

381
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,629
I saw you checking out those girls
back at the diner.

382
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:31,010
-What?
-Come on, fess up.

383
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:33,233
No, I was making sure
they weren't staring at us.

384
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,471
With what, their asses?

385
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:39,359
Beautiful girls in Panama.
They Iove Americans.

386
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:40,754
Cool.

387
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:44,024
So how Iong you known about girls?

388
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,611
Long enough.

389
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,948
Since when?

390
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:54,196
-Thirteen.
-Thirteen?

391
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,897
With who?

392
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:59,553
-Donna Anselmi.
-She was the kid next door.

393
00:29:59,805 --> 00:30:02,672
-She was about....
-Four years older than me?

394
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,948
Your mom was paying her
for French Iessons.

395
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:07,012
Well, she earned the money.

396
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:11,705
Come on. Away from the road.

397
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:14,105
You're still way too close. Let's go.

398
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:20,092
-You want to learn some tricks, Gracey?
-Like what?

399
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:27,147
I let you into my life.

400
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:31,861
Eighteen, 27.

401
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:39,948
Evening, Mrs. Hollander.

402
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,034
How you feeling, Iittle Teddy?

403
00:31:17,437 --> 00:31:20,702
NM, six....

404
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:26,232
NM.

405
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:30,776
Three.

406
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,044
NM.

407
00:31:43,197 --> 00:31:44,926
NM, 6-3.

408
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,525
NM, NM, NM....

409
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,145
Tomorrow.

410
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,574
Pam, I really can't talk right now.

411
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:14,283
Maybe I should call back.

412
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,846
-Who is this?
-I think you already know.

413
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:35,900
If you've done anything to Pam.

414
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:39,425
-Or my boy--
-We both know your family's fine.

415
00:32:39,453 --> 00:32:42,820
Although Pam did seem a little upset
about you leaving.

416
00:32:42,973 --> 00:32:45,999
But then, you had to, didn 't you?

417
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:48,636
Because you couldn 't let her find out.

418
00:32:49,277 --> 00:32:54,476
-Find out about what?
-Oscar Shales, you remember?

419
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:56,840
The one that got away.

420
00:32:57,341 --> 00:33:00,868
Except he didn 't get too far, did he?

421
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:04,080
-You're slipping, Scofield.
-Maybe.

422
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:06,622
Let's hypothesize for a moment.

423
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:09,777
Let's pretend
I was the one who caught Shales.

424
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:14,835
I don 't think I could have just handed
that psychopath over to the courts.

425
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:16,904
Not after he had eluded me for so long.

426
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:19,457
Made me Iook bad.

427
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:22,350
You've been out in the sun
way too Iong, boy.

428
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:24,158
You Feds make a nice living.

429
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:26,881
But not so nice you go around
tearing up expensive sod.

430
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,841
Not unless you had to do a Iittle digging.

431
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,790
Not unless you wanted
to hide something.

432
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:33,675
Or someone.

433
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:38,664
That's what all the Iye was for,
wasn't it?

434
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:41,092
See, because there are two kinds of lye.

435
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:45,070
Small amounts of the first kind
can be a gardener's best friend.

436
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:48,052
And Iarge bags of the other kind
decomposes bodies.

437
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,288
Oh, you should write mystery novels.

438
00:33:50,365 --> 00:33:51,923
I don 't know about you...

439
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:55,567
...but if I buried someone
in my own back yard...

440
00:33:57,117 --> 00:33:59,551
...I'd think about it all the time.

441
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:05,368
I'd think maybe I should
move that body.

442
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:08,754
Then I'd remember...

443
00:34:08,861 --> 00:34:13,149
...that DNA leaches into soil,
so even when the body was gone...

444
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:15,709
...the proof of what I ' d done
would still be there.

445
00:34:16,861 --> 00:34:19,352
I can imagine how it feels.

446
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:23,153
The pressure.

447
00:34:24,285 --> 00:34:26,446
The constant fear.

448
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:30,751
It's more than a man can bear.

449
00:34:34,653 --> 00:34:35,881
I'm gonna give you a chance.

450
00:34:36,893 --> 00:34:40,852
Back off, Iet me
and my family disappear.

451
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:45,889
And in return, I'll keep your little secret.

452
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:48,395
How does that sound?

453
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,920
Like a dead man talking.

454
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:54,956
I know it's not
how you wanted this to play out.

455
00:34:56,157 --> 00:34:58,921
But sometimes things happen
that are just...

456
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:02,350
...out of your control.

457
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:06,234
This is one of those times.

458
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:09,545
Take care of yourself.

459
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:13,439
I'II see you soon, Michael.

460
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:21,113
Oh, and Michael,
it just may be sooner than you think.

461
00:35:38,717 --> 00:35:40,685
Did you have a nice nap?

462
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:44,132
Visions of 1 2-year-olds
dancing in your head?

463
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:48,669
-You're trespassing.
-Nobody Iives here anymore, Goldilocks.

464
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:50,466
Seems the owner hit the bricks...

465
00:35:50,557 --> 00:35:54,254
...as soon as she heard a certain someone
had re-entered society.

466
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:57,102
Left in a hurry too.
Even Ieft some stuff behind.

467
00:35:58,493 --> 00:36:03,328
So this is where Theodore
practiced " Pervert Knows Best."

468
00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:09,652
This is where he had his family supper.

469
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:12,737
And that, I believe...

470
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:16,164
...is where you and Mrs. Hollander
expressed your Iove.

471
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:20,239
Tell me, Iittle Teddy,
did you make her wear Dr. Dentons...

472
00:36:20,285 --> 00:36:24,051
...and hold a Iunchbox
to help you get all worked up?

473
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:26,524
Bradley, I couldn't possibly expect...

474
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:29,556
...a grown man
who still Iives with his mama...

475
00:36:30,045 --> 00:36:32,741
...to understand the machinations
of Iove.

476
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:44,447
You want to know how we found you?

477
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:48,778
Fifty-two mash notes
sent by you to this address.

478
00:36:48,797 --> 00:36:54,360
AII of them begging Mrs. Hollander
to take your white-trash ass back.

479
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:58,589
And every one of them
boomeranged to Fox River...

480
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:00,989
...marked " Return To Sender."

481
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:04,575
The guards had a real Iaugh
reading them, didn't we, Geary?

482
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:06,366
Oh, damn right, we did.

483
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:11,869
That is one mangy Iooking paw
you got there, slick.

484
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:14,895
What happened, Boy Scout fight back?
Geary.

485
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,602
Now, you're gonna tell me...

486
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,191
...where you stashed
Westmoreland's money.

487
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:23,197
Or I'm gonna pluck you
Iike a chicken, stitch by stitch.

488
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,302
Fine, you wanna know
where the money is?

489
00:37:35,196 --> 00:37:37,960
I did spend a whole bunch of it
Iast night on your mama.

490
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:43,210
Wrong answer.

491
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:01,156
Come on, baby.

492
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:04,088
How are you?

493
00:38:04,189 --> 00:38:05,520
You're good?

494
00:38:05,629 --> 00:38:08,063
-Yeah.
-She's okay.

495
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:24,857
-Baby.
-Yeah?

496
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:28,134
What do we do now?

497
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:57,434
We didn't have to wait too Iong at all.

498
00:39:00,669 --> 00:39:02,432
What are we gonna do?

499
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:06,052
Get a ticket on the train. Come on.

500
00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:09,399
Just wait here until the train comes.

501
00:40:22,396 --> 00:40:25,456
Yeah, I think that's the guy
right over there.

502
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:41,773
Two Caucasian males on foot,
fleeing the Willcox station.

503
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:44,755
I'm running.

504
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:57,742
L.J!

505
00:40:59,197 --> 00:41:00,562
-L.J!
-Hold it, right there.

506
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:02,569
-Stop.
-Don't move.

507
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:04,296
PIease, please.

508
00:41:04,413 --> 00:41:06,540
-He's got nothing to do with this.
-Face down!

509
00:41:06,621 --> 00:41:08,555
-PIease.
-Now!

510
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:11,885
Cuff them.

511
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:16,745
L.J., I'm sorry.

512
00:41:18,749 --> 00:41:21,946
Suspect in custody.
Possible ID, Lincoln Burrows.

513
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:30,334
I'm sorry. L.J., I'm sorry.
