1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,829
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,766
-Where is it?
-Go to hell.

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,496
You did this to yourself.

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,402
Sara, if you're listening, I only hope
by now you've found your safe haven.

5
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:15,139
I took advantage of you and put you in a
place that's every doctor's nightmare.

6
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,109
Sara Tancredi. You know her well?

7
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,342
I'd know her better if you
get my ass moved.

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,953
-I'll talk to the warden.
-Another Chance, Safe Haven.

9
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,683
Those are the names of some of the
chapters in the book they use in A.A.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,463
Don't make no mistake about it.
We will be a family if it kills us.

11
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:32,891
That's your map?

12
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,900
-What happened to your arm?
-My dad drinks too.

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,968
My tummy hurts.

14
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,042
She needs that medicine.
She can't go two days without it.

15
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,905
Kacee's going into the system now.
Aiding an escaped con.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,742
-I'll turn myself in.
-Kacee said you need to run.

17
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,714
If you turn yourself in,
Dede won't have either of you.

18
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,587
-Michael, I want this to be over.
-That makes two of us.

19
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,223
It's looking at whatever
your father gave you.

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,449
It's just a key.

21
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,623
If I may, sir.
The president, she could be useful.

22
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,093
Madame President?

23
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,732
I want you to come home, Paul.

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,596
But not with those brothers
running around the country.

25
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,431
-Caroline.
-Please bring them in, Paul.

26
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,631
And everything can go back
to the way it was.

27
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,761
Agent Kellerman.

28
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,800
Paul, where are you?

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,407
-Out in the cold, remember?
-I'm speaking in Chicago tonight.

30
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,815
Yeah, well....

31
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,715
Lincoln.

32
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,490
Sara.

33
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,886
It' s funny how you only call me
when you need me.

34
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:13,294
-Maybe funny's not the right word.
-All of this can go away, Paul.

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,892
-Can it?
- Yes.

36
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,730
I am the president of the United States.

37
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:22,068
Please just come back to Chicago
and turn Burrows and Scofield in.

38
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:26,736
I promise you that I will make everything
go back to the way it was.

39
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,872
-I have to go.
-Just come back, Paul.

40
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,085
I need you.

41
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,019
You actually think we have a shot?

42
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,583
It depends
on what your father gave you.

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,163
This fell out of his pocket when I found
him. I don't recognize the insignia, do you?

44
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,164
No.

45
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,934
But, uh....

46
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,199
Sara, we've got someone working
with us now.

47
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,751
Good morning, sunshine.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,757
How'd you sleep?

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,361
I tell you what.

50
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,167
I'll go unlock the kids
and make us all breakfast.

51
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,532
No, I'll get the kids.

52
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,601
-No.
-I insist.

53
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,265
No.

54
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,862
I'll get the kids.

55
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,167
And my hand cream will make them
rope burns feel better.

56
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,103
It won't work.

57
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,672
Of course it will.
Says right here on the bottle:

58
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,072
-"Soothes skin irritations and--"
-No. This.

59
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,408
It won't work. I've got a job.
The kids have school.

60
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,845
We're all gonna get back
to our normal routines...

61
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,111
...once this little
adjustment period is over.

62
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,312
-There's someone coming over today.
-Who?

63
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,787
This woman, Patty,
from the Welcome Wagon Committee.

64
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,392
-Call her and cancel.
-I don't have her number.

65
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,257
And if she shows up
and I don't answer the door...

66
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,898
...she's gonna know
something's wrong.

67
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,661
Teddy.

68
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,371
Teddy bear.

69
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,868
You need to go.

70
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,884
If she recognizes you....

71
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,452
I don't want you to get in trouble.

72
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,828
That's nonsense.

73
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,831
It's no trouble.

74
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,198
No trouble at all.

75
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,972
Wakey-wakey, children.

76
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,310
Hi, Sara.

77
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,715
What's done is done.
We all want the same thing.

78
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,556
You didn't tell us you left her to die.

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,025
I was scaring her.

80
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,322
I would've pulled her out.

81
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,556
No. No,
you left me in there to drown.

82
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,963
I wonder how long
you can hold your breath.

83
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,195
-Maybe we should find out.
-You need me and you know it.

84
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,002
You need me.
You need me and you know it.

85
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,779
Why? Why do we need him? We have
the key. We'll find out what it's for.

86
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,073
I can tell you what that key's for
right now.

87
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,349
It's to a private cigar club.

88
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,181
Where?

89
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,292
Chicago.

90
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,797
We have to hurry.

91
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,667
We have to hurry, Larry.
I did a bad thing.

92
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,602
I did a very bad thing.

93
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,736
All gas stations.

94
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,609
On 80, 30, 77.

95
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,514
I want Scofield and Burrows' pictures
on each and every gas pump.

96
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,677
If they have no fuel,
they can't get anywhere.

97
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,015
-Sir.
-What?

98
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,591
We might need to divert our attention
away from Scofield and Burrows.

99
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,389
-Why would I do that?
-One of the escapees just killed a civilian.

100
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,390
Patoshik.

101
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:18,033
A man fitting his description was spotted
running from the scene of a brutal homicide.

102
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,967
It happened in Algoma, Wisconsin.

103
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,465
It's less than four hours
from the president.

104
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,975
Call the field office in Madison
and have them get some agents out there.

105
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,579
-I'll notify headquarters.
-I didn't say headquarters.

106
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,443
Are you not following direct orders?

107
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,942
Oh, I'm following direct orders, sir.

108
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,117
Just not from you anymore.

109
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,387
Everything goes through headquarters
from now on.

110
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,825
May l?

111
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,295
Yeah?

112
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,498
You heard about Patoshik?

113
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:57,802
Just now.

114
00:07:58,845 --> 00:07:59,971
Good.

115
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,710
-He goes.
-Come on.

116
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,076
The man is mentally ill.
He doesn't know anything.

117
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,378
Patoshik was one of Scofield's
cellmates for a while.

118
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,021
He's included in the escape.
Who knows what he knows.

119
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,647
-Scofield and Burrows are still out.
-Don't worry about Scofield and Burrows.

120
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,727
So.

121
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,457
Again.

122
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,026
Patoshik goes.

123
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,325
Take care of it.

124
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,864
Hi. Are you in charge of seating?

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,009
-Yeah. Can I help you?
-Agent Paul Kellerman, Secret Service.

126
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,510
I'm transporting a fugitive to Chicago.
I need you to clear a car for me.

127
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,773
-A fugitive?
-That's right.

128
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,577
It's just, we're already near capacity,
I mean--

129
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,913
You want us to rub elbows
with the passengers?

130
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,680
-No, sir.
-Okay.

131
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,323
What's he wanted for?

132
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,480
Killing people.

133
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,793
-Good Lord.
-Make it happen.

134
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,186
Come on. Follow me.

135
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,840
It's gonna be all right.

136
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,638
If you say so.

137
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,045
We use him to get what we need...

138
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,214
...then we dump him.

139
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,714
Okay.

140
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,698
I'm sorry you got involved in this.

141
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,360
The fact that you're helping us...

142
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,135
...it means a lot.

143
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,562
Thank you.

144
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,775
The other riders aren't in any danger,
are they?

145
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,417
I mean, should I make an announcement
or anything?

146
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,314
You want pandemonium?

147
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,852
-No, sir.
-Okay, then no announcements, all right?

148
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,922
Keep everybody out of this car
and everything's jake.

149
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,925
I've done this a million times,
never had a problem.

150
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,528
Yeah. Will do.

151
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,208
Let's go.

152
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,245
For all passengers
going to Chicago...

153
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,680
...we will be stopping at stations....

154
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,184
We'll be in Chicago in about five hours.

155
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,982
You wanna get some rest?

156
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,899
You okay?

157
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,709
Yeah.

158
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,660
Brad.

159
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,852
You don't look good.

160
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,864
I helped you with Sara Tancredi, and you
were supposed to get me into Ad Seg.

161
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,725
I tried.

162
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,868
But your new warden...

163
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,334
...straight as an arrow...

164
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,410
...but I might be able
to do you one better than Ad Seg.

165
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,283
You found Scofield and Burrows
through the Russian girl, right?

166
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,681
Yeah, Nika. Why?

167
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:32,256
And you tracked down Bagwell
by following Susan Hollander.

168
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,859
Yeah. And I blow my nose
with my right hand...

169
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,326
...and I wipe my ass with my left.
What of it?

170
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:48,531
I've got very powerful people behind me
that want me to finish my job.

171
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:54,141
They can push the quickest habeas corpus
proceedings the courts have ever seen.

172
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,681
The paperwork's sitting on the
right person's desk as we speak...

173
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,288
...setting forth all the constitutional
violations in your prosecution.

174
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,924
It's just waiting to be rubber-stamped.

175
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,389
And what do I have to do?

176
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,695
You just find those cons.

177
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,157
Only this time...

178
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,833
...you're gonna do it for me.

179
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:22,440
Unofficially, under the radar,
no paper trail.

180
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:28,409
I need a junkyard dog who's willing
to do the ugly things it takes...

181
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,106
...to bring a con to justice.

182
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,184
Are you my dog, Brad?

183
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,426
Damn hell yeah, I am.

184
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,595
This is delicious.

185
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,431
What'd you call it again?

186
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,935
That, my dear Pattycake, is what my auntie
back in ' Bama used to call hobo chicken...

187
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,370
...one part chicken, two parts spice,
three parts actual hobo.

188
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,170
Oh, come on.

189
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,675
I know...

190
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,951
...fowl isn't part of a traditional
brunch, per se...

191
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,116
...but I have found a lean meat
can act as an aperitif...

192
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,759
...to awaken the palate...

193
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,558
...for more subtle flavors
and textures...

194
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,167
...such as--

195
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,029
Mommy!

196
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,531
--pumpkin cinnamon bread
with fresh strawberries and cream.

197
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,699
Oh, boy.

198
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,208
Now, how did you two meet?

199
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,637
Church.

200
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,842
After my...

201
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,579
...accident...

202
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,655
...I was volunteering
with some other amputees.

203
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,886
My parish back home
did an exchange program...

204
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,758
...with churches all over this fine country
and, well...

205
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,060
...the good Lord just saw fit to plop
my country rump right down...

206
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,227
...in the pew right beside my Suzie Q.

207
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,339
And you just stole her heart.

208
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,608
I'm a regular one-armed bandit.

209
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,443
Mrs. Wallace.

210
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,818
Teddy just bought me a brand-new bike.

211
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,749
-It's out in the garage. Wanna go see?
-Sure.

212
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,615
We have got company.

213
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,349
Oh, that's okay.

214
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,927
No, it's not. It's rude.
Zack knows better, ain't that right?

215
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,032
You do know better, Zack.

216
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,037
You gotta have discipline.

217
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:48,582
Without a strong father figure,
a young man might just end up in prison.

218
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,762
Since you are such a fan...

219
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,428
...of Elaine's store-bought blueberry pie,
I'm gonna bake you a real pie.

220
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,038
My name's Lance, and I'm an addict.

221
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,651
Hi. My name is not Lance,
and I'm not an addict.

222
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,457
Michael.

223
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,294
Do you know if there's any way
I can get any water?

224
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,831
Yeah, I think there's a bathroom
downstairs. I'll check.

225
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,236
Thanks.

226
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,482
It was never personal, Sara.

227
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,655
-War never is.
-Yeah.

228
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,889
Sara.

229
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,349
Sara, back off.

230
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,052
-Let him go, Sara. Sara!
-Sara.

231
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,194
Settle down.

232
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,934
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

233
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,703
You get one of those.
You get one of those. One.

234
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,878
Down. Get down, right now.

235
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,280
What?

236
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:08,119
These three guys said they saw
what looked to be a fight going on in there.

237
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,454
They didn't, okay?
Just get the train to Chicago.

238
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,223
-Do I need to notify the police?
-Do what I told you to do.

239
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,857
Take the tickets, I'll watch the fugitive,
you can continue to do bong-hits...

240
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,335
...or whatever you do back there, okay?
You guys mind your own business.

241
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,932
Everybody clear?

242
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,005
Great.

243
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,574
Don't interrupt again, please.

244
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,375
Just so we're all clear...

245
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,382
...if she tries that again--

246
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,746
You'll do what?

247
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,751
Just stay on the other side of the car.

248
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,058
It wasn't personal, Paul.

249
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,241
The pleasure was all ours, Pattycake.

250
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,881
Oh, what are these?

251
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,683
I'm gonna do some renovations.

252
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:43,219
I was just tapping the sheetrock,
looking for the stud.

253
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,151
Looks like you already found one.

254
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,649
Potty-mouth!

255
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,895
Me and the girls get together
every Friday for book club.

256
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,263
You ought to host it this week,
and everybody can meet you.

257
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,494
I'll see you then.

258
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,228
Can't wait.

259
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,477
This ain't never gonna work here.

260
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,745
Go pack your things.

261
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,177
We're moving.

262
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,606
Now, if you don't stop me...

263
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:43,976
...I am gonna eat this whole thing
by myself, huh?

264
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,582
All right, sweetie.

265
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,724
Listen, I'll make a deal with you.

266
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,459
Remember that merry-go-round
that we saw today?

267
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:01,458
You're not gonna get a chance to ride it
if you don't eat something. Go ahead.

268
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,863
I don't feel good.

269
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,872
Oh, sweetie.

270
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,539
Okay, come on. Let's go, all right?

271
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,046
I got you.

272
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,722
Okay, just hold on, okay, sweetpea?
Check, please.

273
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,055
All right, nobody move.

274
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,572
-Hey, Sara.
-Not now.

275
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,293
How is she?

276
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,925
Well, she wants to be alone.

277
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,427
So we get what her dad locked away
with that key. What do we do then?

278
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,969
I mean, you saw what they did
with the tape we made.

279
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,606
They're gonna bury everything.

280
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,867
That's why we're keeping him
close to us.

281
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,671
He's got a lot of connections
in Washington.

282
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,138
So we get to this cigar club,
open her dad's box.

283
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,081
What if the only thing inside's
a bunch of stogies?

284
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,151
I think it's worth making the trip
to find out.

285
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,267
-Yes?
-Caroline.

286
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,875
Paul, where are you?

287
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:56,547
I need to know exactly what you meant
when you said you're gonna make this right.

288
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,843
-I need specifics.
-Where are you? What's that noise?

289
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,384
I'm on a train.
I'll be in Chicago later today.

290
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,279
But I need to know some specifics.

291
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,947
Where are Burrows and Scofield?
Are they with you?

292
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,616
Don't worry about them,
worry about me.

293
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:13,993
Paul, there are still positions in my
administration that need to be filled...

294
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,102
...including chief of staff.
I want that to be you.

295
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,206
When I get to Chicago,
we'll meet and we'll talk.

296
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,878
All of it.

297
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:36,350
Man, I just brought enough to get a
sandwich. I was sitting right there.

298
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,549
If you're lying--

299
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:44,162
Look, my daughter is sick and I don't
wanna spend any more minutes in here.

300
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,392
Trust me, that is all that I have.

301
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,596
What do you got, sweetheart?

302
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,835
What do you got?

303
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,910
-You don't want to listen?
-Hey. Hey, calm down, man.

304
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,987
-Shut up.
-All right.

305
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,317
Listen to me.
You've got to calm down.

306
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,587
I can help you get everything
that you want.

307
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,253
But you don't want to hurt
anybody else, right?

308
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,898
Come on.

309
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,134
Look, listen. Hey.

310
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:27,066
Why don't you lock the door
and turn the closed sign back...

311
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,670
...so everybody thinks that this place
is closed, all right?

312
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,367
And then we can get everybody
away from the window.

313
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,740
Is that cool?
Everybody's away from the window.

314
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,041
Let's move everybody on
to this side of the room.

315
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,583
Get on this side. Let's move to this side
of the room, away from the window.

316
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,812
Let's get on this side of the room, okay?

317
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,651
This side of the room.
Why don't you take my daughter, okay?

318
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,420
Take her on this side of the room so that
everybody, everything is gonna be okay.

319
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,563
Everything is gonna be fine.

320
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,859
Because you're not gonna put your hand
on another person, right?

321
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,634
Right. We're all good.

322
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,470
You all good?

323
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,073
We're good, right?

324
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,638
-Hey, Sara.
-Come on in.

325
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,997
I've been sitting here, evaluating.

326
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,703
I jumped bail, I'm on the run...

327
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,981
...and I just tried to take a man's life.

328
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,081
I'm not using.

329
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,753
Which is actually
quite an accomplishment.

330
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,190
But three weeks ago, I was a doctor.

331
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,157
You can get that back.

332
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,160
All of it.

333
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,195
You need to believe that.

334
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,804
You believe that?

335
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,270
You think you can get it all back?

336
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,444
I choose to have faith.

337
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,550
Because without that, I have nothing.

338
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,425
It's the only thing
that's keeping me going.

339
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,832
Well.

340
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,462
I got two things keeping me going.

341
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,004
The first is that I want the people
who took my dad.

342
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,135
And actually the second...

343
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:53,149
...ironically, I probably wouldn't even say
if I hadn't lost it.

344
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,751
But...

345
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,254
...you should know that--

346
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:12,231
The first thing they tell you
when you take the job is...

347
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,972
...never to fall in love with an inmate.

348
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,655
What's going on?

349
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,057
Roadblock.

350
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,506
Linc, it's locked.

351
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,344
Hey, you can't be in here.

352
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,996
-Run the roadblock.
-Man, I can't do that.

353
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,461
Run it.

354
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,791
Hey, hold them up!

355
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,635
Bradley Bellick, FBl.

356
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,765
Brad Bellick,
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.

357
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,311
Brad Bellick, FBl.

358
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,582
Special Agent Brad Bellick, FBl.

359
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,442
Hi, there.
I'm Brad Bellick with the FBl.

360
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,519
I'm an agent with the FBl, Brad Bellick.

361
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,955
Brad Bellick. I'm with the Bureau.

362
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,130
Brad Bellick. I'm with the Bureau.

363
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,196
I already talked to the cops.
Told them all I had to say.

364
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:33,201
Yeah, well, I'm no local hayseed cop.
I'm federal.

365
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,597
And you're not gonna get away
with lying to me.

366
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,772
-I didn't lie to nobody.
-Really?

367
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,912
"He was just some homeless guy.
Hangs around Hancock Square...

368
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,208
...hitting up college kids for change.
He's down there all the time.

369
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,715
If he's not there,
I don't know where to find him."

370
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,649
-That's your statement?
-Pretty much.

371
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:53,621
Well, you see the problem is,
Charles "Haywire" Patoshik's a paranoid...

372
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,125
...who suffers from fear of crowds,
who's terrified of strangers.

373
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,731
If he's anywhere, it's the middle of nowhere,
keeping to himself, being a weirdo.

374
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,958
-And?
-And if you want to get tough...

375
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:06,704
...how about I arrest you right now
for hindering a federal investigation?

376
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,099
Who they gonna believe?

377
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,868
An agent with 1 5 years on the force
and three presidential citations...

378
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:16,173
...or a piece of white trash
with a juvie record?

379
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,510
I didn't ask him to do it.

380
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:22,414
But in case you haven't noticed, I ain't
exactly broken up over my dad's death.

381
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,714
Why can't you just leave
this Patoshik guy alone?

382
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,550
Where is he?

383
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:30,721
Or do you want to get locked up
right now?

384
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,703
-Yeah?
-I got a lead on Patoshik.

385
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:40,860
Where?

386
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,262
I'm on my way.

387
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,703
Keep him there.

388
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,276
Alone.

389
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:54,680
Any information on Scofield and Burrows,
I want to be notified immediately.

390
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,946
If that works out for you.

391
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,553
They're gonna have cops waiting for us
at the next station.

392
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,526
-We need to jump, then.
-And do what?

393
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,063
Hide under a barrel?

394
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,598
Linc's right.

395
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,774
Okay, just put those in there.

396
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,967
So sorry about all this.

397
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,874
It's okay, sweetpea.

398
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,219
Here's everything right here, man.

399
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,726
-It's good.
-All right.

400
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,885
Everyone in the storage room. Now.

401
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,256
What?

402
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,960
Get back there,
until the cops show up.

403
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,302
No, no, no, no.
I can't go back there.

404
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,131
-Come on.
-No.

405
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,297
You kept a cool head this whole time,
don't get yourself killed.

406
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,033
You know what? Listen to me.

407
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,272
I'm a wanted man.

408
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,504
Okay?

409
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,481
The police show up here, they'll take me
back to prison. You know what? That's fine.

410
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,950
But my little girl right here, she's sick...

411
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,911
...and she's gonna be left alone.

412
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,453
And I can't let that happen.

413
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,029
So can you please let us go?

414
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,698
-Split.
-Okay.

415
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:28,542
-Go on.
-Come on, sweetie, let's go.

416
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,542
All right, everyone in the back. Move.

417
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:35,945
Not you.

418
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,553
You're coming with me.

419
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,614
Go on, move.

420
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,491
Look, I want you to stay right here,
okay?

421
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,455
-Go on.
-Hey.

422
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,238
-I think you should let her go, man.
-Take off. Last chance.

423
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,430
You got the money...

424
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,804
...burglary and assault, man.
Hey, that's change, that's little time.

425
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,605
But this right here?

426
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:05,340
You will be in prison for the rest
of your life. You believe me on that.

427
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,542
Unless you want your daughter
to see you die...

428
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,709
...move.

429
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,558
I'm trying to help you, man.

430
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,656
Come here!

431
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,065
Sweetie, stay right there.

432
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,108
Oh, no.

433
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,721
Who did this?

434
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:56,956
I did.

435
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,037
Thank you.

436
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,621
Haywire.

437
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,690
Don't move.

438
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:29,232
Run, Larry, run. Run, run.

439
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,571
Dino, it's Eric.
We got four jumpers.

440
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,274
Three males and a female.
Call it in and get to the next station.

441
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:49,682
Do you hear me?
Get us to the next station.

442
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,789
The men who pushed the roadblock
are off the train...

443
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,861
...near mile marker 54
just south of the Tedford Bridge.

444
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,073
This is the state police.
Stop. Stop where you are.

445
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,073
-Freeze.
-Don't shoot.

446
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,210
Don't shoot.

447
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,641
Turn around.

448
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,851
I'm an employee of the train company.

449
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,550
Dino, it's Eric. We got four jumpers.

450
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,554
Three males and a female.
Get us to the next station.

451
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,817
Let's go. Come on.

452
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:07,755
They told us to jump and run
and not to look back, or they'd shoot us.

453
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,328
We need to find a car.

454
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,405
Yeah?

455
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,051
I got Haywire trapped.

456
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,379
Don't do anything.

457
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,482
Just hold him till I get there.

458
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,453
No problem.
I got this wing nut treed.

459
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,008
-Caroline.
-Paul, where are you?

460
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,745
-Did you send the police?
-No, of course not.

461
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,652
-How did they know I was on that train?
-Paul, I have no idea.

462
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:44,290
-I'll let the president know.
-I contact the president directly.

463
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,497
Are Burrows and Scofield with you?

464
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,231
I was expecting to brief the president.

465
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,067
You report to me now.

466
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,505
Paul?

467
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,500
Where did we spend my 35th birthday?

468
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,009
What?

469
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:05,342
The restaurant, where was lt?
You remember.

470
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,211
Don't be ridiculous. I have to go.

471
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,285
-Do not hang up.
-I have to go.

472
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,513
-Just get Burrows and Scofield.
-Hey.

473
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,688
Whoever this is...

474
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,055
...tell Bill Kim
that he just screwed up...

475
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,696
...big time.

476
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,661
Paul?

477
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,300
Paul?

478
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,223
What's all this?

479
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:55,763
Some wacko climbed to the top
of a grain elevator.

480
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,064
People wanna watch.

481
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:01,830
God, you were supposed to keep a handle
on it. Do you know what that means?

482
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,406
I got you Haywire.
What else do you want?

483
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,340
FBl. He's my chargee.

484
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,542
How you doing, Charles?

485
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,309
I don't wanna go back to prison.

486
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,482
I don't blame you.

487
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,983
I wanna go to Holland.

488
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,814
That's not what I expected to hear.

489
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,250
But you can't go there, son.

490
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,054
I just--

491
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:07,064
I just want to go here.

492
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,395
See?

493
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,539
I'll tell you what.

494
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,876
You don't have to go to prison.

495
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,112
But you can't go to Holland either.

496
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,119
Oh, no, no, no....

497
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,123
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Hey.

498
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,692
You're in a tough spot.

499
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,329
You feel trapped, you got no options...

500
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,694
...and you're caught in a situation
where you have no control.

501
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,931
I know how you feel.

502
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,331
I do.

503
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:45,030
It takes its toll on you,
and all you want to do is run.

504
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,807
But run where?

505
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,414
I just want to go.

506
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,383
There's a way out.

507
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,354
A way out?

508
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,363
Of this maze?

509
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,431
Yeah.

510
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,399
There are private humidors in the back,
each member's name is on their box.

511
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,672
-Any security?
-A receptionist, that's it.

512
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,548
I'm not a wanted fugitive.

513
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,744
Give me the key. I'll do it.

514
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,051
Want to take a walk?

515
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,790
Yeah.

516
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,088
I know you killed your parents
because they hurt you.

517
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:45,160
And I know you killed that guy because
he was hurting Sasha, but what you did...

518
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,237
...was wrong, you know that.

519
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,241
I just wanna go.

520
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,772
You can.

521
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,682
I wanna go now.

522
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,795
It's okay.

523
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,051
Sara.

524
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,084
About before.

525
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,087
Me too.

526
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,072
Yeah.

527
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,195
