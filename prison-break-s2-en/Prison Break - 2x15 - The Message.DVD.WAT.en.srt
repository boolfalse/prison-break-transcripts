1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,533
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:05,262
Yes. I'd like the number
for Channel 1 1 News, please.

3
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:07,429
Hang up the phone now.

4
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,268
This is Michael Scofield.

5
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,706
I'm at the Cutback Motel, room 1 1.

6
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,777
And I want to turn myself in.

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,780
Where is that?

8
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:24,779
It's Holland, where I grew up.
You know that.

9
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,086
It's beautiful.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,526
This message is for Maricruz.
I'll be there in the airport.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,529
In lxtapa, waiting for you.

12
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,831
Hi. My name is Sara, and I'm an addict.

13
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,766
Hi, Sara.

14
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:41,771
I'm just looking to do my time.
I don't want any trouble.

15
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,909
Hey! Break it up, convicts.

16
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:48,775
This isn't fun, what was fun was
when Caroline and I talked about you...

17
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,143
...and the schoolboy crush
that you had on her.

18
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,782
He proposed to her.

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,219
-Terrence!
-Terrence!

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,754
I'm leaving!

21
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,585
Terrence, listen to me.

22
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,388
Just listen, so many people have suffered
because of this, because of you.

23
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,999
But when the press get here,
you can tell the truth.

24
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,498
You can end this.

25
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,767
-Sorry.
-Terrence, no!

26
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:16,234
We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.

27
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,544
It's breaking news
out of Cutback, Montana.

28
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,543
Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield...

29
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:25,445
...two of the prisoners who broke out
of Fox River State Penitentiary in Illinois...

30
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,577
...have continued to elude the authorities,
leaving a trail of crime in their wake.

31
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,123
And today,
they left behind something else.

32
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,622
My name's Lincoln Burrows,
and I'm innocent.

33
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,630
-We're done.
-No other way out.

34
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,776
Next time you hold a conference
do it from a room with a back door.

35
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,639
Just let me think.

36
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,110
This is the Montana Highway Patrol.

37
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,381
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows...

38
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,883
...you need to exit
with your hands in the air.

39
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,023
-This is a warning.
-You got line of sight from there?

40
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,385
Exit with your hands up.

41
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,455
-What about him?
-Him? He's useless.

42
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,460
Dead body?
We got fingerprints everywhere.

43
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,360
You worried someone
will pin a murder on you?

44
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,831
What's your plan?
Leave the body, walk out the door?

45
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,368
Yes. That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

46
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:23,168
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows,
you need to exit with your hands up.

47
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,975
-FBl, hold your fire.
-FBl?

48
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,139
-I have Burrows and Scofield.
-Start rolling.

49
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,114
We're coming out. Hold your fire.

50
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,332
-Hold up, who are you?
-Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.

51
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,702
-We're going to Billings.
-Wait, let me see that lD again.

52
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,342
-Okay, okay.
-Drop the gun!

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,070
Everybody calm down
and this won't get ugly.

54
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,775
All right. I want keys
to both of the cop cars, now!

55
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,475
-Don't do it!
-Don't listen to him!

56
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,848
-Get the keys, get in the car.
-What's going on?

57
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,990
Getting out of here
before anyone gets hurt.

58
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,715
Lincoln, start it.

59
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,122
-Come on, come on!
-This is your last chance.

60
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,458
-I'm not gonna tell you again.
-One more step, and I drop him.

61
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,026
Come on!

62
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,297
Open my door.

63
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,514
Welcome back.

64
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,986
-You feeling...?
-Much better.

65
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,258
-Update?
-Okay, you got it.

66
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,293
Yeah.

67
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,992
You got a lead on something?

68
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,634
One of the CO's from Fox River,
Brad Bellick.

69
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,797
Got locked up last night
for the murder of another guard.

70
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,599
Wait. We're looking for CO's now?

71
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,172
What about the escapees?

72
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,243
-Scofield, Burrows?
-Nothing on them currently.

73
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,402
Also, Franklin's wife...

74
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,445
...was taken into custody
in North Dakota.

75
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,311
His wife?

76
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,747
Line two.

77
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,755
This is Agent Mahone.

78
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:23,957
How long ago?

79
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,941
I'll make you a deal. You don't move
a muscle, I won't blow your head off.

80
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,013
-No one's gonna hurt you, Greg.
-Where are we going, Michael?

81
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,876
We can't keep driving. Lost Steadman.

82
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,018
-Sara's in the wind--
-Turn it up.

83
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,018
...murder of Terrence Steadman,
President Reynolds ' brother.

84
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:52,555
The president could not be reached
as she continues to tour the Midwest...

85
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,386
...shoring up support in key states.

86
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,496
For entrepreneurs and orange growers,
iron workers and artists...

87
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,192
... the American dream is alive
and well for all of us.

88
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,563
Reynolds travels to Colorado today...

89
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,535
...for a scheduled appearance
in Denver that--

90
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,902
-Pull over.
-What for?

91
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,812
Just pull over.

92
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:38,231
Get out. Over here.

93
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,170
-You want to drop off this kid?
-Later.

94
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,776
We should get rid of Kellerman too.
We don't need him.

95
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,880
Actually, we do. We still have assets.

96
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,947
It's just a question
of how we use them.

97
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,891
Bradlee.

98
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,660
Nurse.

99
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,132
Nurse.

100
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,402
-You ain't no nurse.
-You're right about that.

101
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,133
That's a pretty shiner you got,
captain.

102
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,833
Make you think about the times...

103
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,411
...you walked around here
in your fancy guard outfit.

104
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,981
Turning a blind eye
to everything you saw that was wrong.

105
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,847
"Who, me? Oh, I didn't see nothing."

106
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,255
How's that blind eye feel now?

107
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,085
-You son of a bitch.
-You get used to it.

108
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,093
Hear old one-eyed Jack's
gonna be getting screwed in the socket.

109
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,424
-Over my dead body.
-No.

110
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,096
A dead man can't feel a beatdown.

111
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,168
And you got a lot more
coming your way.

112
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,367
Come on now. Let's go.

113
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,399
It'll take the feds a while
to figure that out.

114
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,100
What time is it?

115
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,507
-A little after 9.
-It's gonna be tight.

116
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,375
Four hundred and fifty miles
in six hours.

117
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,311
-What do you think?
-Gotta move now.

118
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,247
Eyes front.

119
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,380
Hey, look at this.

120
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,422
-It's perfect, you ready?
-Yep.

121
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,072
Puerto Rico.

122
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,490
Here, Larry, this is for you.

123
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,148
What about this?

124
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,123
What is this? This is too small.

125
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,629
Why didn't it float? Why didn't it...?

126
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,130
I need more wood.

127
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,098
Wood floats.

128
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,100
This'll work.

129
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,535
Hey, man.

130
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,512
We were just wondering
if you could buy us some beer.

131
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,247
Yeah, sure.

132
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,829
Can I get some food for my dog too?

133
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,725
Do whatever thing you gotta do, man.

134
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,388
You can keep a beer for yourself.

135
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,127
Oh, no.

136
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,734
My dad used to drink.

137
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,688
You're gonna want to see this.

138
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,695
We've shut down every freeway
in central Montana.

139
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,926
-So far, no sign of them.
-Go wider.

140
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,571
Put troopers on 90 and 94,
all the way through Wyoming.

141
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,175
Call Whitefish. Have them lock down
the Canadian border at 1 5.

142
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:54,278
...have continued to elude the authorities,
leaving a trail of crime in their wake.

143
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,416
And today,
they left behind something else.

144
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,647
My name's Lincoln Burrows,
and I'm innocent.

145
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,181
I escaped from Fox River Penitentiary...

146
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,814
...because I was sentenced to death
for a crime I did not commit.

147
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,558
I did not murder Terrence Steadman.

148
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,756
He committed suicide last night
in the Cutback Motel...

149
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,993
...30 miles outside from his home
in Blackfoot, Montana.

150
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,327
He killed himself out of fear...

151
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,803
...fear of the people who 've been hiding him
for the past three years.

152
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,604
The same people
who want my brother dead.

153
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,174
They don 't want you to know
who they are, but know this...

154
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,480
...they've stolen billions of dollars
and murdered dozens of innocent people.

155
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,681
And yet, they plaster our faces
on the news, and tell you to be afraid.

156
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,226
They are a group of multinationals,
corporate interests.

157
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,522
Together, they're known
as The Company.

158
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,223
They are working
with the highest levels of government...

159
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,766
...including
the President of the United States.

160
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,167
-Damage control.
-They've stolen billions of dollars.

161
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,001
Before this hits page one.

162
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,803
-lt' s already airing, sir.
-Start a wildfire in Florida!

163
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,243
Find a storage unit full of Arabs!
I do not care!

164
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,212
As long as it's not about Lincoln Burrows!

165
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,976
-And they operate with impunity.
-Go!

166
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:12,216
Under the cover of the Secret Service,
the very people meant to protect and serve.

167
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,082
Calomatillo.

168
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,128
Much blame has been placed...

169
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,431
...on another innocent person,
Dr. Sara Tancredi.

170
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,937
Do we know how long
the videotape lasts?

171
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,407
Twenty-six minutes, beginning to end.
It's all online.

172
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,302
I know I can 't ask you
for another chance.

173
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,841
I can only hope that by now
you've found your safe haven.

174
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,083
Start a transcript. I need every word.

175
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:29,516
And I put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

176
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,356
I wish I could do things differently.

177
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,930
Call Montana. Send an agent
to talk to the cameraman.

178
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,499
I wanna know what he saw, heard,
what they're wearing.

179
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,570
-Anything he can give us.
-Yeah.

180
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:45,571
One man, Special Agent Alexander Mahone,
is responsible for multiple deaths.

181
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,736
He murdered not only
John Abruzzi and David Apolskis...

182
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,849
...but also the last fugitive
he was assigned to chase.

183
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,712
A man names Oscar Shales.

184
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,150
A man who escaped from prison
two years ago...

185
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,921
... who remains one of this country's
most wanted...

186
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:03,289
-...despite the fact he will never be found.
-Guy' s nuts.

187
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,488
They'll do whatever it takes
to make the deaths look official.

188
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,361
Like they happened in the line of duty.
Disappearances....

189
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,569
-Hey, thank you.
-Sure. Here you go.

190
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,974
What' s the wood for?

191
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,842
I ' m building a raft.

192
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,085
I need more wood
if I ' m gonna make it to Holland.

193
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,048
-Holland?
-Yeah.

194
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,357
You want to see it? The raft?

195
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:42,827
You're gonna try to get
from here to Holland in that?

196
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,031
Yeah, good luck, Gilligan.

197
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,832
I'm gonna take a leak.

198
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,042
How are you gonna know
where you're going?

199
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,839
Do you have like a map or anything?

200
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:59,077
Yeah, I do.

201
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,277
It's right....

202
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,716
Oh, it's right here.

203
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,694
That's your map?

204
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,396
Well, I really hope you make it.

205
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,701
You know, every morning I wake up
and wonder...

206
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,036
...what it would be like to just disappear.

207
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,339
And you're just gonna do it.

208
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,915
I think it's great.

209
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,353
Okay.

210
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,430
What happened to your arm?

211
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,910
My dad drinks too.

212
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,606
What's going on?

213
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,843
-Oh, nothing.
-No, no. No, no, don't....

214
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,419
-l....
-Let me go.

215
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,580
-I just want to fix it. I just want to make--
-Let me go. Stop.

216
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,185
Matt, will you take me home, please?

217
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,954
No, l....

218
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,528
Freak.

219
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,456
All right, now, Brad. How we doing?

220
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,030
I could be better.

221
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:58,966
Yeah, that's a nasty contusion,
but it should go down in about 24 hours.

222
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,074
I got your paperwork here for your transfer
back to gen pop.

223
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,709
Already?

224
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,072
Move them in, move them out.
You know the policy.

225
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,508
Katie.

226
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,811
You look nice today.

227
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,314
You've worked here over 1 0 years, right?

228
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,451
Something like that.

229
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,355
That's a long time we've been friends.

230
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:31,335
Brad, if you think I can pull some strings
to keep you out of gen pop, I can't do that.

231
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,903
Please, please,
you can't send me back there.

232
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,905
Do you want that responsibility,
knowing what they'll do to me?

233
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,373
Just listen, please. One more night.

234
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,410
Just let me stay here tonight.

235
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,810
I know you can do that.

236
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,083
And when you go home,
just leave that door open for me.

237
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,729
They hung a sheet behind their heads
on the wall.

238
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,791
One of them, the guy with the gun...

239
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:08,133
...he found it while Burrows and Scofield
were talking about how far they had to go.

240
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:14,574
Scofield said something
about 450 miles in six hours.

241
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,110
-Four hundred fifty miles to where?
-I don't know.

242
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,313
Four hundred fifty miles in six hours.

243
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:28,892
Any point on this circle
could be their final destination.

244
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:33,293
Seventy-five miles per hour,
stopping for gas.

245
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,898
-It's doable.
-Yeah.

246
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,830
Where are they?

247
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:42,095
I'm not sure. I still need more time.

248
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:46,267
This can't happen fast enough.
They've already done irreparable damage.

249
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,572
Scofield made the video
in a storage facility...

250
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,615
...somewhere between Great Falls
and Helena not long after sunrise.

251
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,445
From there, the witness said...

252
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,418
...that they had 450 miles
to get to where they were going.

253
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,116
There's Seattle, Portland,
Salt Lake, Denver....

254
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,126
-Denver?
-Yes, what?

255
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,560
The president is speaking there
this afternoon.

256
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,730
-Three o'clock.
-Six hours from when they made the video.

257
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,301
They're going after the president.

258
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,517
A tape made by escaped convicts
Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield...

259
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,678
...was immediately dismissed by the
Justice Department as entirely baseless...

260
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:34,724
...which brings us back to the story we'll be
continuing to follow throughout the day.

261
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,690
Terror threat
has been raised to orange...

262
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,798
...as a storage unit rented by several
Arab-Americans was suddenly seized.

263
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,628
They buried it.
Dumped it off the front page and buried it.

264
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,030
It's what they do.

265
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,467
They can spin it all they want.
It's out there now.

266
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,733
Give it time, the tape is gonna work.

267
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,969
-This is a Hail Mary if we don't get to her.
-Getting to her is easy.

268
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,343
-What we do after's the problem.
-Which is why it has to happen quickly.

269
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,076
Once anyone knows we have her,
the curtain comes down.

270
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,115
-I'll notify the White House to cancel--
-No.

271
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:10,227
If there's a change, the brothers will know
something's up and go back into hiding.

272
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,727
We've found them before.
We can find them again.

273
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,661
These are not pets, Agent Wheeler.

274
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,936
Yeah, thanks. I'm pretty clear on that.

275
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,096
But if you use the commander in chief
as bait, that's not gonna--

276
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,742
You have a problem
with the way that I do things?

277
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,712
Yeah.

278
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,744
And I'm not the only one.

279
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,576
Is that right?

280
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:40,624
Internal Affairs has asked me to run all
your moves through them from here on out.

281
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,133
Then, get a pen...

282
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,798
...and make sure
you get this word for word.

283
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,840
The president's day does not change.

284
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,914
The only lead we have is that we know
where these men are headed.

285
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,381
So we're gonna keep quiet about this...

286
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,810
...and let them come.

287
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,887
Now get out of my office.

288
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:21,789
They're two of the most recognizable faces
in America.

289
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,993
How do they think they're gonna get
anywhere near the president?

290
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,263
Because it's not
just the two of them anymore.

291
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,600
I'm gonna go take a closer look
at that video.

292
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,405
If I may, sir, the president...

293
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,413
...are you certain
we should keep her in the dark on this?

294
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,452
Because there is...

295
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,420
...a scenario where she could be useful.

296
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,292
It is her ass on the line, sir.

297
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,662
I think we're pretty clear...

298
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:58,530
...she's been known to get her hands dirty
when that line gets too close.

299
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,704
Maybe we should let her know...

300
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,573
...just how close it is.

301
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,178
Travelling without money is difficult.

302
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,507
They did a good job masking the room.
No reflections or flares.

303
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,673
Audio markers: church bells,
construction, traffic. Anything?

304
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,014
The room tone tells us they were
in a large space, about 1 00,000 cubic feet.

305
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,520
So the kid with the camera,
his story matches up.

306
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,023
We clocked the quality of light
with the time of day.

307
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,683
It fits his wheres and whens.

308
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,089
All right, content.

309
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,494
The usual tells: eyes, hands, feet.

310
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,134
Burrows, we're able to baseline
off his trial footage...

311
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,293
...so we got even more clarity there.

312
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,535
I escaped from Fox River Penitentiary...

313
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:52,370
...because I was sentenced to death
for a crime I did not commit.

314
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,377
-I did not murder Terrence Steadman.
-Okay, there.

315
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,713
The eyes. See it?

316
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,544
A slight shift to the left, then up.

317
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,381
Yeah, the blink rate's up here
verses the pattern.

318
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,524
He committed suicide last night
in the Cutback Motel...

319
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,660
...30 miles outside from his home
in Blackfoot, Montana.

320
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,123
-He's lying.
-Seems so.

321
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,836
Okay, here. Burrows, arms folded.

322
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,473
He' s protecting himself.

323
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,406
Not a lot of confidence in these words.

324
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,374
Like they happened in the line of duty.

325
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,746
They mean something
other than what he's saying.

326
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,484
The posture. Shoulders in for emphasis.

327
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,554
He wants your attention here.

328
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,153
Okay, there.

329
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,728
-Adam's apple.
-Zoom in, zoom in.

330
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,556
See? He's swallowing.

331
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,493
Throat's dry. That's a lie.

332
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,328
-Yeah.
-His behavior is textbook.

333
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,335
If there's anything about
what they plan on doing in Denver...

334
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,097
...they're gonna tell us.

335
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,073
-lf you say it that way, it plays too earnest.
-Of course it will, it's the truth.

336
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,681
But the truth sends them home
to their wife and kids.

337
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,180
Lies will keep them busy.

338
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,444
I'm not telling a lie to the whole country.

339
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,021
-It's our one chance to say it how--
-Say whatever the hell you want.

340
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,682
Tell them you're the Green Lantern.
I know how they break down these tapes.

341
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,421
I've done it. Every detail matters.

342
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:23,863
Bin Laden crosses his legs right over left
tells something different than left over right.

343
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,297
It's not the same message.

344
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,199
To them, it is.

345
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,708
If you want this plan to work,
whatever you say with your mouths...

346
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,776
...you need to say something different
with your bodies and eyes.

347
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,311
Slightly up and to the left.

348
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,346
Yes.

349
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,544
Much blame has been placed
on another innocent person...

350
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,555
President's motorcade is rolling in.
No sign of the brothers.

351
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,285
Right there.
What's Scofield doing with his hand?

352
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:54,054
We've been throwing them fastballs.
What do you say we mix it up a little?

353
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,494
Like what?

354
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,996
I think it's Morse code.

355
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,263
-For what?
-Well, right now, we got a phrase:

356
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,134
"The water is warm."

357
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,099
Any idea what that might mean?

358
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,109
-What the hell does that mean?
-Nothing.

359
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,477
It'll take the feds a while
to figure out.

360
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:14,550
We have teams checking
the surrounding counties for water temps.

361
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:17,085
Yeah, it might be a message
to an accomplice.

362
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,589
The North Platte River runs through the city.
Maybe--

363
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,752
It doesn't mean anything.
He's with an ex-Secret Service guy.

364
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,693
They're spoon-feeding us
every lead they want us to follow.

365
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,528
So this is a distraction
while they go after the president.

366
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,795
They had to know
the tape would be discredited.

367
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,098
They had to know
that we'd talk to the cameraman.

368
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,106
-There's something else going on.
-Much blame has been placed...

369
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,212
...on another innocent person,
Dr. Sara Tancredi.

370
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,011
Sara, if you 're listening...

371
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,345
...I know I can 't ask you
for another chance.

372
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,053
I only hope by now
you 've found your safe haven.

373
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,989
I took advantage of you,
of your commitment to help others...

374
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,619
...and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

375
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:01,993
Sara, if you 're listening...

376
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,362
...I know I can 't ask you
for another chance.

377
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,767
I only hope by now
you 've found your safe haven.

378
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,473
I took advantage of you,
of your commitment to help others...

379
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,740
...and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

380
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,314
...of your commitment to help others...

381
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,077
...and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

382
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,915
I've considered many ways to apologize,
but I must arrive at one.

383
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,290
It' s more of the same here.

384
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:31,758
Body language, his tells. If you ask me,
it doesn't look like he means this at all.

385
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,592
-Don't care what it looks like. Play it.
-I don't see how--

386
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,994
Play it again.

387
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,901
I only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.

388
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,701
I took advantage of you,
of your commitment to help others...

389
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,175
...and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare....

390
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,337
His voice.
Would you say he sounds sincere...

391
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,348
...when talking to her as opposed
to talking about their crimes?

392
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,849
I guess you could say that.

393
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,577
I did say that. Would you say that?

394
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,723
I wish I could do this differently,
but it's too late for that now.

395
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:03,054
-Yeah.
-It's too late for you and for others.

396
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,456
People murdered....

397
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:08,030
This isn ' t about T errence Steadman
and it' s not about their innocence.

398
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,133
-What?
-They're not after the president.

399
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,600
They're going after the doctor.
I want everything we got on Sara Tancredi.

400
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,295
Friends, families, pen pals.

401
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,840
If anybody wrote her a thank-you note,
I wanna know where the hell they are.

402
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,272
Now!

403
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:24,424
Sara Tancredi. Dad dead, mom dead.

404
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:28,663
E-mail account shows a minimal list
of contacts, with very little activity.

405
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,435
Credit cards used mostly for groceries,
sporadic clothing shopping...

406
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,340
...and the purchase
of single movie tickets.

407
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,844
And ob-gyn records tell us...

408
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,075
...she's had very little in the way
of sexual relationships recently.

409
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,618
Tell you the truth, I would say
the bulk of her life was her work.

410
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,300
Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?

411
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,884
Apparently, we took out a janitor.

412
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,622
When it all comes down,
all of this will get cleared up.

413
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,993
Well, it ain't coming down
if we don't get Sara.

414
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,600
She'll be here.

415
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,428
I wanna speak to my brother.

416
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,768
We gotta start thinking
about what to do if she doesn't show.

417
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,606
Or if she does.

418
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,378
What if the only reason
this guy's helping us...

419
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,746
...is to get
whatever information Sara has?

420
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,990
What if this is just one giant setup?

421
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,199
Well, good night.

422
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,051
About time you come home.

423
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,482
You out with that Feytek boy again?

424
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,457
-Sasha.
-No!

425
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,893
You may look like me...

426
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,701
...but you take after your mom
when it comes to the boys, now, don't you?

427
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,701
Hopefully, with a little better taste.

428
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,971
Damn it, girl,
you are gonna show me some respect.

429
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,919
-I know Sara didn't have many friends.
-She's sort of a loner.

430
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,324
But you were her friend.

431
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,598
I like to think so, yes.

432
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,326
But you have no idea where she is now?

433
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,298
No.

434
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,531
This is a transcript
of the Scofield-Burrows videotape.

435
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,574
I highlighted the part
where he talks directly to Sara.

436
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,841
Mean anything to you?

437
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,942
No.

438
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:28,677
You have no idea where
she might meet him, if that's his plan?

439
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,878
No.

440
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,582
Is Brad Bellick still here in the infirmary?

441
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,355
Yeah. Why?

442
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,122
You must be loving this.

443
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,792
I didn't drive all this way to gloat.

444
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,936
Well, then, what the hell
you come here for?

445
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:53,069
First, I really gotta tip my cap to you.

446
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:56,236
You've managed to draw a bead on
the convicts than my own staff.

447
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,813
Well, thanks for the "attaboy."

448
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,918
But as you can see, the correctional system
doesn't share your gratitude.

449
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,445
I won't take much of your time.
I have a few questions.

450
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,147
-About?
-Sara Tancredi.

451
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:10,260
She listed you as a reference
on her job application to work here.

452
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,191
You know her well?

453
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,500
I'd know her a lot better if you can
get my ass moved to ad seg.

454
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,332
I have no influence with the DOC.
You know that.

455
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,841
You want my help, you do.

456
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,372
I'll talk to the warden, see what I can do.

457
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,447
Right after you give me some answers.

458
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,813
Scofield likes to communicate
with Sara via coded message.

459
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,613
You recognize anything here?

460
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,155
Anything that he may be
trying to tell her?

461
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,021
No. I mean, he's saying he's sorry.

462
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,790
Not that that's gonna do any good
with Dr. Cold Shoulder.

463
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,591
But....

464
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,867
What?

465
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,601
Ad seg.

466
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,643
Yeah.

467
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,040
You see here?

468
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,619
Where it says this stuff about
"another chance" and "safe haven"?

469
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,518
-That's out of the Big Book.
-What big book?

470
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,421
Alcoholics Anonymous.
Sara's in recovery.

471
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,061
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

472
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,220
Those are the names
of some of the chapters...

473
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,263
...in the book they use in AA.

474
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,731
Do you have a copy
of the Alcoholics Anonymous book?

475
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,468
Sara, if you're listening...

476
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,472
...I know I can 't ask you
for another chance.

477
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,813
I can only hope by now
you 've found your safe haven.

478
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,182
I took advantage of you,
of your commitment to help others.

479
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,393
I put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

480
00:38:56,267 --> 00:39:00,033
I've considered many ways to apologize,
but I must arrive at one.

481
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,704
-lt' s getting late.
-I know.

482
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,105
She' s not here.

483
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,338
I know that too.

484
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,740
There is a chance
she didn't get the message.

485
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,613
Or maybe she's just sick of all this.

486
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,777
I mean, the girl bailed on you
back in Gila.

487
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,856
What makes you think
she's gonna come running back now?

488
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,924
The same thing that's been keeping us
going for the last three months.

489
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,190
-Faith.
-Yeah, well....

490
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,527
Reality's kicking faith's ass, man.

491
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,929
-Michael Crane....
-Look--

492
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,730
-Wait, wait.
-Wait?

493
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,998
-Man, we can't wait anymore.
-Listen, listen.

494
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,302
Once again, Michael Crane...

495
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,274
...please report to the front desk.

496
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,936
You have a telephone call.

497
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,113
Yeah, Sara Tancredi.

498
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:49,047
Right, she might be with him.
Just--

499
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,156
Yes. Just call the local police in Akron
and tell them to get everyone they have...

500
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,258
...over to St. Thomas Hospital now.

501
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,896
Michael Crane.
I think you've got a phone call for me.

502
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,391
Here you go.

503
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,566
Thank you.

504
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,600
This is Mr. Crane.

505
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,012
It sounded better than origami.

506
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,349
Even if you got the message,
I wasn't sure you'd respond.

507
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,816
I couldn't get to you in time.
This is the only thing I could think of.

508
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,988
I swore I'd leave you alone...

509
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,455
...but I had to contact you.

510
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,194
Because I have something?

511
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,390
How'd you know?

512
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,322
Michael, back in Gila,
I was coming back to you.

513
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,396
Somebody grabbed me...

514
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,837
...and they told me that my father
had given me something.

515
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,000
Did someone hurt you?

516
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,806
I got away.

517
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,515
Michael, I want for this to be over.

518
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,781
That makes two of us.

519
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,917
Do you think that's possible?

520
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,190
With your help, yes.

521
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,799
It's just a question of looking
at whatever it is your father gave you.

522
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,434
It's just....

523
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,501
It's just a key.

524
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,231
Well, we'll figure it out.

525
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,436
Together.

526
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,646
I like the sound of that.

527
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,743
Me too.

528
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,904
Hello, Paul.

529
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,006
Madame President, it's been a while.

530
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,510
I know. I'm calling to apologize.

531
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,740
Okay.

532
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,417
I'm so sorry.
It all just got away from me.

533
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:08,752
And I ended up hurting the one person
who 's always been at my side.

534
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,689
I want you to come home, Paul.

535
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,954
We can fix this together.

536
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,893
But not with those brothers...

537
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:19,695
...running around the country, tearing down
the very office you helped me build.

538
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,066
Caroline.

539
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,968
I want to make it up to you.

540
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,768
Please bring them in, Paul...

541
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:29,379
...and everything can go back
to the way it was.

542
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,981
I have to go now. I'll see you soon.

543
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,393
Did you talk to Sara?

544
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:51,892
In a few days, this should all be over,
one way or the other.

545
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,833
Absolutely.

546
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,807
