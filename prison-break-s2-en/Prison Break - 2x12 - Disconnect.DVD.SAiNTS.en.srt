1
00:00:01,247 --> 00:00:03,078
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:06,398
Listen, why don't I give you
half the money and we call it a day?

3
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:07,898
All right, 60-40.

4
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:09,830
You thieving son of a bitch.

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,116
You better get down on your knees
and pray to God that I don't find you.

6
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:17,247
Because if I do, mark my words,
I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

7
00:00:17,247 --> 00:00:18,805
-Mr. Bellick?
-Yeah.

8
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:20,902
Do you mind answering
a few more questions?

9
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:23,755
We have a lead as to where Burrows
will meet with his brother.

10
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:25,604
A place he referred to as Bolshoi Booze.

11
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:26,855
They're numbers.

12
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:31,241
Plug them into your GPS. It'll take you
to a spot in the New Mexico desert.

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,589
-Daddy!
-Hey, baby. You ready to go?

14
00:00:34,623 --> 00:00:36,284
Come on. Go, go, go!

15
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:38,801
What do we do now?

16
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:44,456
-Has she told you anything?
-Not yet.

17
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:47,068
-Then kill her.
-Well, if she knows something....

18
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:48,625
You disobey me, you are done.

19
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:50,032
Put her in the ground, Paul.

20
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:51,371
You're going to die.

21
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:54,615
And all you had to do was tell me
what your father gave you.

22
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,917
Go to hell.

23
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,952
The plane's gonna stop
at the seven-mile marker...

24
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:06,092
...Route Four, at sunset.

25
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:08,439
-We gotta go.
-I brought someone. Dad?

26
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:11,979
We've met before.

27
00:01:16,446 --> 00:01:18,744
-lt was you.
-Go easy, son.

28
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:21,424
Stay away from me.

29
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:24,420
-What the hell's going on?
-I know him.

30
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:27,878
-You know him? That's impossible.
-I know him. I know this man.

31
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,291
-Michael.
-Maybe that's far enough.

32
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,232
-This doesn't concern you.
-What the hell's going on, Dad?

33
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:48,593
After Mom died...

34
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,021
...you were in juvie.

35
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:57,023
They put me with this foster father...

36
00:01:57,023 --> 00:01:59,617
...down on Pershing Avenue.

37
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:03,596
He punished me.

38
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:06,086
Locked me up.

39
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:09,317
If you leave someone alone
in the dark for that long...

40
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,440
...their eyes start to adjust.

41
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:17,835
You start to see things,
no matter how small...

42
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:22,637
...because if they exist,
they can help you.

43
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,533
Help you do
the only thing you wanna do...

44
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,173
... when you 're alone in the dark.

45
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,340
Get out.

46
00:03:01,694 --> 00:03:03,992
I've used just about every lure
that you can use.

47
00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:07,075
Most of them,
you need to be an expert to use.

48
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:08,932
This MotoLure's a little different.

49
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,219
Everybody, I mean,
everybody, can fish with it.

50
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:15,121
Catch bigger fish,
you 're gonna catch more fish.

51
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:19,615
It even works in weedy areas
where most top water lures won 't work.

52
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:22,675
Take a look at this baby.
This thing looks like a real minnow.

53
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,796
It's one very cool bait.

54
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:28,054
I have never seen anything quite like this.

55
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:31,360
Even if you 've bought lures off TV
in the past and been disappointed...

56
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,291
...and believe me, I know how you feel.

57
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:37,470
-Oh, sorry, man. I thought you ' d left.
-Hey. No, still here. Here I am.

58
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,631
It' s just that a couple guests
are complaining...

59
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:41,178
...about the volume of your TV.

60
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:45,695
Oh, sorry. I fell asleep.
I must've hit the remote.

61
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:48,357
-I'll take care of it. Thanks. Sorry. Thanks.
-That's great.

62
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:52,929
So could you do that for me now, please,
so it's taken care of?

63
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,484
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

64
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,950
Taken care of.

65
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:11,148
Is everything okay in your bathroom?

66
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,278
Excuse me?

67
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:16,750
In your bathroom.
There's a noise coming from it.

68
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,697
Yeah, my daughter
thinks bath time is playtime.

69
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,934
I will clean it up. Scout's honor. Sorry.

70
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,192
-All right. Have a nice day.
-Yeah.

71
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:28,364
You too.

72
00:04:38,463 --> 00:04:39,691
-Michael!
-Michael.

73
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,275
-Michael, please, wait.
-He did this to you?

74
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:43,427
Lincoln!

75
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,850
He did this to you?

76
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,191
Did he do this to you?

77
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,882
Michael.

78
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:02,579
How could you do that
to another human being...

79
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:04,818
...with your own hands?

80
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,151
It's okay.

81
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:18,154
You're safe now.

82
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:24,837
He's not gonna hurt you anymore.

83
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,210
Come on.

84
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:37,852
Come with me and don't look back.

85
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,507
Michael!

86
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,711
Michael.

87
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:01,994
It's gonna be all right.

88
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:54,911
Sara!

89
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,352
Six months.

90
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:54,665
Six months I was in that place.

91
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:56,838
Where were you?

92
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,569
How long did you know?

93
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:01,247
I found you as soon as I could.
The state kept moving you.

94
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,572
Then you went away again.

95
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:05,053
You don't think it killed me
to leave you like that?

96
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,609
To leave in the first place?

97
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:08,481
Since the beginning, I was the problem.

98
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:11,509
Since day one.
Your lives are what they are because of me.

99
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,279
Yes, Linc told me about The Company.

100
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:16,935
You were some kind of analyst.
That's the job you chose over your family.

101
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,392
I thought I was doing the right thing,
protecting you.

102
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:21,082
From what, Dad? From who?

103
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:24,955
The Company had enemies.
I was important to The Company.

104
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,357
I became a target. Easiest way
to get to me would be to get to you.

105
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:30,990
I left as soon as I realized
how corrupt it was.

106
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,868
-How they were buying the government.
-You could've come back.

107
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,511
No, I couldn't!

108
00:09:35,614 --> 00:09:40,278
Michael, turning on The Company
put me and you at even greater risk.

109
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,869
I had to stay away.

110
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,347
We were your sons.

111
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:46,963
And you still are, Michael.

112
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:49,580
We can fix this.

113
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:52,597
I came back so that we could fix this.

114
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:56,508
This can never be fixed.

115
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:01,318
There's a tape.

116
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:04,269
It gives us everything we need.

117
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,108
Linc will be set free if we find it.

118
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:10,592
You're not gonna believe
who he thinks has it.

119
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:12,787
Who?

120
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,834
Sara.

121
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,677
Yes, tall, slender,
brown hair, brown eyes.

122
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:24,551
She'd be pretty banged up.

123
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,507
No one matching that description
has been brought into the ER.

124
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:33,969
Kellerman.

125
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:35,545
The report on Sara Tancredi?

126
00:10:35,646 --> 00:10:37,910
She's dead.
I'm dealing with the body right now.

127
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:42,201
-You must be relieved that it's over.
- Yeah.

128
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:44,899
-Yeah, I gotta go, Bill.
-One more thing.

129
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,218
Confirmation.

130
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:48,918
I need a photo of the body
before disposal.

131
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,390
Take one with your phone
and send it to me, and I'll--

132
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:53,922
Bill, not a good time right now, all right?

133
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,165
Paul, take a breath...

134
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,591
...then take the picture.

135
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,329
I'm waiting.

136
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,864
"They traveled
into a very dangerous place.

137
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:18,469
Now, Arvid knew that, but he held tightly
onto the dragon's leash anyway...

138
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:20,792
...as the creature ran
into the ever-dark forest...

139
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:23,057
...pulling the young boy behind him."

140
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:25,818
Why didn't he just let go of the leash?

141
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:28,822
Well, because he loved the dragon.

142
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:33,527
And when you love someone,
you'll do anything to hold onto them.

143
00:11:33,663 --> 00:11:36,928
Anything to keep them safe and happy.

144
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:38,809
Is that why we're camping?

145
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,205
Yep, so we can all be together.

146
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:44,761
I'm happy.

147
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:49,623
You know, I'm happy too.

148
00:11:56,318 --> 00:11:58,183
Here you go.

149
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:12,279
Well, it's all working out, huh?

150
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,958
Don't say that.

151
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:31,132
You know, this moment,
right here, right now...

152
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:34,196
...it's all worth it.

153
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,495
I love you.

154
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,194
I love you.

155
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,659
Oh, that's old.

156
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:10,929
-The kids are bigger now.
-Sorry, I was just....

157
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:14,375
Oh, getting bored out of your wits
because you've been waiting so long.

158
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:16,229
I'm really sorry about all this.

159
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:18,582
We don't get a whole bunch
of homicides out here...

160
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:21,282
...and we're trying to play catch-up.
Please, have a seat.

161
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,187
I'm real sorry about your friend.

162
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,340
It's a sick world out there.

163
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:31,465
Ain't that the truth.

164
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:35,197
-So you guys out here in Kansas together?
-Yeah, that's right.

165
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:36,715
Doing what?

166
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:38,847
Well, you know, just seeing the sights.

167
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,604
You left Chicago to see the sights
in Tribune, Kansas?

168
00:13:41,662 --> 00:13:43,721
Last I checked,
a man could go where he wanted.

169
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:46,570
-Mr. Bellick.
-Brad.

170
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:49,106
Brad.

171
00:13:49,214 --> 00:13:51,614
I don't really care
what you were doing out here.

172
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:55,705
We're both in law enforcement.
We can each sniff out a perp like a hot fart.

173
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:58,292
Pardon my French.

174
00:13:58,622 --> 00:14:00,920
And we both know
you're not a criminal...

175
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:05,970
...so I don't care if you boys were out here
whooping it without your wives...

176
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,234
...or going Brokeback.

177
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,840
What?

178
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:11,179
Hell, no.

179
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:13,854
My point is,
I don't care what you were doing.

180
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:17,786
I just need to know where you were doing it
and who you might've crossed paths with...

181
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,350
...so I can find out
who carved up Mr. Geary.

182
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:31,085
Geary and I got a lead that one
of the Fox River Eight was in town.

183
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,668
Which one?

184
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:36,147
-Theodore Bagwell.
-The man who did those horrible things...

185
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,055
-...to those teenagers?
-That's him.

186
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,544
We're gonna bring him in for the reward
money but we couldn't get a handle.

187
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:44,262
Geary and I split up,
we figured we didn't have a shot, but--

188
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,309
-But what?
-Well, after what happened...

189
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:50,300
...I'm starting to think maybe Geary
ran into old Bagwell after all.

190
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,992
Right here in Tribune?

191
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:57,062
Now, Brad, do you think
you could answer some questions...

192
00:14:57,118 --> 00:15:00,315
...that might help us, you know,
track down Theodore Bagwell?

193
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,840
I'd be indebted.

194
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,351
I'll do whatever I can to help nail
that son of a bitch.

195
00:15:05,374 --> 00:15:07,239
You think Sara has this tape?

196
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:08,691
The government does.

197
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,990
I just saw her yesterday.
If she does have anything...

198
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:14,316
...she doesn't know.

199
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,712
-Well, where is she now?
-I don't know.

200
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:20,410
Any way you can get in touch with her?

201
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:23,675
-We bought cell phones. I could call her.
-Please, please, please, bro.

202
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,304
Call her from Panama, please.

203
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:29,631
We got less than two hours.
I gotta make the flight.

204
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:34,387
What?

205
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:40,553
Run. Run!

206
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,719
-Where's this car you keep talking about?
-It's over the ridge.

207
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:51,749
Give me that. You guys head for the car.

208
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:54,305
Go!

209
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:02,592
Come on, come on!

210
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,781
Come on! Go, go, go!

211
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,547
Pick up Dad!

212
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:18,469
Dad, get in!

213
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,370
Come on, Dad!

214
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:35,075
We made it! Son of a bitch, we made it!

215
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,994
Linc.

216
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:58,324
Sucre, get us to a hospital.

217
00:16:58,398 --> 00:17:02,814
-Out here? Where the hell am I gonna find--?
-Just get us to a hospital, please!

218
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,282
Don't worry, you're gonna make it.

219
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:08,398
It's bile. He got me clean through.

220
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:11,540
You're gonna be okay. Just hold on.

221
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:14,016
Listen to me, both of you.

222
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:17,891
Sorry.

223
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:20,280
I wish I'd never left.

224
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:25,376
Don't talk. Just breathe, okay?

225
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:32,465
Okay. So do you want a P.B.& B.?

226
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,503
Not really. My tummy hurts.

227
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,178
Where's her knapsack?

228
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,214
Her what?

229
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,818
-Her knapsack. Her medicine's in it.
-I don't know. I just grabbed her and ran.

230
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:48,655
She needs that medicine.
She can't go two days without it.

231
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:51,214
Okay, I know. I'm her father, all right?

232
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:53,585
Where is it?

233
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:56,356
Baby, baby. Look, look, calm down.
What are you looking for?

234
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:59,144
Just tell me what it is
and I'll go ahead and get it, okay?

235
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:00,893
Her prescription.

236
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,970
It's a backup. I keep an extra, in case.

237
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:07,286
Okay, okay.

238
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:12,523
So all I need to do is find a pharmacy.

239
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,998
Don't worry.

240
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,102
Hey, looks like we're going on a ride,
sweet pea.

241
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,483
If we nail Bagwell, he might still have
some of Geary's things on him...

242
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,070
...Iike his backpack,
which has his personal stuff in it.

243
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:29,567
I know his wife would love to have it.

244
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,619
If we find Bagwell...

245
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,445
-...give it to her personally.
-Thanks.

246
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:35,670
It's the least I can do
considering how you're helping me out.

247
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,645
Although some of the guys
on the force are concerned about....

248
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:42,247
-What are they concerned about?
-Oh, nothing.

249
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:44,950
You know what?
Why don't you tell me what you know?

250
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:47,786
We'll track down Bagwell,
get Geary's effects to his family.

251
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:50,739
I'll make sure everybody involved knows
your help was invaluable.

252
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:54,717
I'll even recommend that you get most of,
if not all of that reward money.

253
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:59,294
Well, what is it exactly that the guys
on the force were concerned about?

254
00:19:01,246 --> 00:19:04,613
Some of them thought you weren't
being totally upfront about your injury.

255
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:08,005
I mean, to be fair, it does seem a little off
that you didn't see the guy...

256
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,397
...who hit you smack-dab
on the forehead.

257
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:16,413
You got me.

258
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:21,853
Geary and me had a little dust-up
over how to go about finding Bagwell.

259
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:25,152
It got physical and he hit me.

260
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:29,016
The two of us, we fought like brothers.
I didn't wanna rat him out to the cops.

261
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:33,303
After the fight, we split up.

262
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:35,321
And then....

263
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:39,421
Well, you know what happened to him.

264
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:43,569
I just wish to hell we'd never fought,
you know.

265
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:46,376
Maybe then, he'd still be....

266
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:50,048
Brad, you can't blame yourself.

267
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:57,135
Why don't we refocus our energy
on finding the man who killed your friend?

268
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:02,434
That's what Roy would've wanted.

269
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:22,043
Where you at, baby?

270
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,831
Insurance card?

271
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:28,079
No, I don't have insurance.

272
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:31,093
You're paying for dexamethasone
without insurance?

273
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:34,262
You got Medicaid,
Medicare or something?

274
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:36,553
Nope. I'll just pay cash.

275
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,947
It's 1 25.

276
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:51,909
Excuse me.

277
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:54,601
Excuse me?

278
00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:57,523
Oh, sorry.

279
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:10,229
I'm sorry I don't have anything smaller.

280
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:14,170
I have to go to the back
to get change for a hundred.

281
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:15,899
So I'll be right back.

282
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:30,126
-Right there, hospital!
-I see it, I see it.

283
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,106
-Just get us there.
-No, you'll be caught.

284
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,158
Then we'll be caught.

285
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:36,306
I'm not gonna let you die.

286
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,467
Then listen to me.

287
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:41,459
You find Sara Tancredi.

288
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:43,887
She can end this.

289
00:21:45,118 --> 00:21:47,313
It's up to you now.

290
00:21:57,918 --> 00:22:02,366
Yeah, I want an alarm out
on a dark blue sedan, license AE 9268.

291
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:04,766
Forty miles southeast of Las Cruces.

292
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:07,443
Do it now.

293
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,529
Oh, come on.

294
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:14,587
What?

295
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:17,493
What hospital?

296
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:27,511
Came in with a bad GSW.
Docs called us in.

297
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:29,608
He's in here.

298
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:31,218
We ran his name.

299
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:35,159
Came back with two federal
drug-smuggling warrants out on him.

300
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,496
Heard you wanted to talk to me.

301
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,710
I got some information the feds want.

302
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:46,853
About Michael Scofield.

303
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,587
Like where he's catching a ride.

304
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:55,606
And where would that be?

305
00:22:56,189 --> 00:23:00,489
It's not just the where, but the when.

306
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:03,377
That when is coming up soon.

307
00:23:04,862 --> 00:23:06,853
But I wanna cut a deal first.

308
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:11,852
Give us a minute?

309
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,578
Anything you wanna say?

310
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,199
One day.

311
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:30,412
That's all we had.

312
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:58,213
Back then,
when things were at their worst...

313
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:02,308
...there were days I thought
I'd never see the sun again.

314
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,231
But he saved my life.

315
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:12,312
Just wish he could've let us
be a part of his.

316
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,291
Yeah.

317
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:29,606
I'll tell him.

318
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:35,701
Here's the deal.

319
00:24:35,806 --> 00:24:38,366
All charges dropped,
government picks up medical costs...

320
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,057
...until you're fit to be deported.

321
00:24:40,158 --> 00:24:43,685
All contingent upon your information
being accurate.

322
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:46,282
Where's Scofield?

323
00:24:47,261 --> 00:24:50,458
No deportation. I want citizenship.

324
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:53,639
Citizenship?

325
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,593
A little incentive,
and I want it in writing.

326
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,793
Oh, I'm so tired of playing games.

327
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:02,150
Well, start typing.

328
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,045
No external pacemaker.

329
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:15,054
Hey, this is a good one.
No morphine drip.

330
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,595
-What are you doing?
-FBl. Out, out, out.

331
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,050
-What the hell are you doing?
-Giving you a little incentive.

332
00:25:22,717 --> 00:25:24,878
Come on. Come on, you son of a--

333
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:26,806
And they found nothing?

334
00:25:27,454 --> 00:25:29,388
Okay, thanks.

335
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,354
Well, your instincts are great, Brad.

336
00:25:31,453 --> 00:25:34,718
But the precinct actually sent a unit over
to Hollander's house today.

337
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:37,741
An anonymous caller said they saw
an intruder but no one was there.

338
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:39,347
Damn it.

339
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:41,284
If you knew about
Bagwell and Hollander...

340
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,500
...why didn't you just head
over there yourself?

341
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:46,171
Oh, we couldn't find the house.

342
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:49,443
Really? It's listed.

343
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:56,943
Excuse me.

344
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:05,923
Thank you.

345
00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:08,777
Everything okay?

346
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,095
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

347
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,793
You ever been to the Fauntleroy Hotel?
It's about 1 5 minutes from here.

348
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:19,992
-Never heard of it.
-Well, that's strange.

349
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:22,623
Because they found this receipt
in Geary's hotel room.

350
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:24,152
It's from your credit card.

351
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:29,117
I don't know how that got there.

352
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:36,827
I think you're being evasive.

353
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:41,113
-You should tell me the truth, Mr. Bellick.
-What happened to "Brad"?

354
00:26:42,174 --> 00:26:44,472
About seven years ago,
I got my first homicide case.

355
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:46,567
A woman. Pretty.
She was brutally attacked.

356
00:26:46,653 --> 00:26:48,985
Animal boyfriend left her for dead.

357
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:51,887
But she was still breathing, barely.

358
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:54,402
But she punched into her cell phone...

359
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:57,829
...the killer's number,
so she solved the crime for us.

360
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:00,989
When we found the receipt, Brad,
it was in Geary's hand...

361
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,216
...his finger pointing to your name.
With his last ounce of strength...

362
00:27:04,254 --> 00:27:06,245
-...he told us you killed him.
-Okay, listen.

363
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:09,064
Geary and I found Bagwell
in Hollander's house.

364
00:27:09,118 --> 00:27:12,781
We roughed him up until he told us
where he'd hid the 5 million bucks...

365
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,322
...we knew he'd dug up in Utah.

366
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:16,727
When we found the money,
Geary double-crossed me...

367
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:18,857
...he hit me in the head
and took the cash.

368
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:22,240
I had nothing to do with Geary's death.
You hear what I'm saying?

369
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:24,829
I'm the victim here,
not that son of a bitch.

370
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,695
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

371
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:39,090
Where you at, baby?

372
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:46,742
Hey, could you hurry it up?

373
00:27:46,813 --> 00:27:49,714
It's just it's getting really late
and I gotta get home.

374
00:27:55,677 --> 00:28:01,949
And that's 20, 40, 50 and 20 is 70.

375
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:07,251
One, two, three, four, five is 75.

376
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:10,788
Excuse me.

377
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:23,707
You gotta be kidding me.

378
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,105
Ma'am.

379
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,041
Afternoon, officer.

380
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:39,960
Do you have any lD with you?

381
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:43,822
No, I walked over here,
so I didn't carry anything with me.

382
00:28:43,837 --> 00:28:46,328
Did you? Where'd you walk from?

383
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:48,928
Is there a problem, officer?

384
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:52,354
There's only a problem
if you make one, Miss Franklin.

385
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:54,247
You want to tell us
where your husband is?

386
00:28:56,765 --> 00:28:58,528
I don't know.

387
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:01,681
Place your hands behind your back,
please, ma'am.

388
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:14,151
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

389
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,573
Oh, my God.

390
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,909
Where is Mommy?

391
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:41,139
Mommy is gonna meet us later, okay?

392
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:49,227
-Yes?
-Where's the photo?

393
00:29:49,341 --> 00:29:50,808
Bill, there was a tactical error.

394
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:54,498
I don't want terminology
from the Cover Your Ass Handbook, Paul.

395
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:57,892
-What happened?
-There were unforeseen circumstances.

396
00:29:57,918 --> 00:30:00,978
-Things that could not be predicted.
-Where's Sara?

397
00:30:02,077 --> 00:30:04,102
She's gone, isn't she?

398
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:10,413
Yes. She got away.

399
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:12,461
But there is no way that she--

400
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:15,230
Bill?

401
00:31:23,677 --> 00:31:26,305
I'm not gonna let you die.

402
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,858
I love you.

403
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:35,814
You know that, don't you?

404
00:31:49,853 --> 00:31:51,821
Too many.

405
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:56,695
Too many people died
because I wanted you to be free.

406
00:31:56,925 --> 00:31:58,916
You couldn't have known, Michael.

407
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,405
You couldn't have known
it would've ended up like this.

408
00:32:02,461 --> 00:32:03,758
But it did.

409
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:08,079
They wanted him.

410
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,458
They wanted him in the ground...

411
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:13,074
...and they got their wish.

412
00:32:14,589 --> 00:32:17,387
This thing's not gonna end here, Michael.

413
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:21,094
-I know.
-It's gonna keep spreading.

414
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:26,279
Their hands are gonna get more
and more bloody.

415
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,408
The question is...

416
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:32,468
...is the blood on their hands or ours?

417
00:32:38,717 --> 00:32:39,945
I'm sorry, guys.

418
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:43,038
We gotta go.

419
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:04,799
Get back on with border patrol.
Call the Navy Reserve Air Station in Dallas.

420
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:06,057
They've got planes on alert.

421
00:33:06,173 --> 00:33:08,767
We need an intercept
of a white single-engine A-36 Beech...

422
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:10,160
...heading toward the border.

423
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:13,261
Call Mexico.
Get clearance for an international pursuit.

424
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:16,403
Tell them if they've gotta take
the plane down, just do it.

425
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:00,235
Come on, guys.

426
00:34:00,893 --> 00:34:02,155
Guys, come on.

427
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,768
Come on, guys.

428
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:07,623
What?

429
00:34:09,853 --> 00:34:11,252
We're staying.

430
00:34:16,797 --> 00:34:20,130
Michael, this is what
we've been waiting for.

431
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:22,717
Maybe we'll see you
down there somewhere.

432
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,112
I can't talk you out of this one, can l?

433
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:34,601
Oh, I hope so.

434
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:37,378
Be good.

435
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:41,064
Thank you, Michael.
Thank you for everything.

436
00:34:46,205 --> 00:34:48,036
-You take care of him, all right?
-I will.

437
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:50,505
Fly safe, papi.

438
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,290
Give them hell.

439
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:15,843
-Panama would've been good.
-Are you ready for this?

440
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:18,744
-Been waiting years.
-Good to hear it.

441
00:35:18,813 --> 00:35:21,611
Because today's the day
we stop running.

442
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,494
-What now?
-We go back to the car...

443
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:42,641
...drive to a border town,
find a cell phone signal...

444
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:44,778
...and call Sara.

445
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:57,924
Where the hell are those jets?

446
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:10,841
-You hear that?
-Yeah.

447
00:36:14,237 --> 00:36:15,932
Pull over.

448
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:29,720
They're going after Sucre.

449
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:32,339
They're gonna take him down.

450
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,634
-How'd they find out?
-I don't know.

451
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:41,408
Michael.

452
00:37:10,844 --> 00:37:12,004
What the hell is going on?

453
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:14,184
If you could arrest me
you would have already.

454
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:16,737
-I'm out of here.
-Not really an option for you.

455
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:20,028
What've you got? A receipt?
He left it in his pocket. A fight? Big deal.

456
00:37:20,093 --> 00:37:23,688
I got 1 0 pals in Chicago who'll tell you
Geary and I threw down once a month.

457
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:27,042
You're right. Any of those things
on their own, probably not enough.

458
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:28,593
But when you add this.

459
00:37:29,436 --> 00:37:31,131
What the hell is that?

460
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:33,424
You left a message for Mr. Geary.

461
00:37:34,781 --> 00:37:37,147
You thieving son of a bitch.

462
00:37:37,212 --> 00:37:40,409
You better get down on your knees
and pray to God that I don 't find you.

463
00:37:40,444 --> 00:37:45,006
Because if I do, mark my words,
I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

464
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,944
You wanna hear it again?

465
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:52,752
Now, at this juncture, Brad...

466
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:56,058
...things will go a whole lot easier for you
if you admit to the crime.

467
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:59,908
Now, you listen to me,
you manipulative little bitch.

468
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:03,981
I did not kill Roy Geary!
You understand what I'm telling you?

469
00:38:04,029 --> 00:38:06,759
Bagwell set me up!
Get your hands off of me!

470
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:10,032
You are under arrest for the murder
of Roy William Geary.

471
00:38:10,077 --> 00:38:12,477
You have a right to remain silent.
Anything you say...

472
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,236
...can be used against you.
You have the right to a lawyer...

473
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,955
...and to have him present.
If you cannot hire a lawyer...

474
00:38:18,013 --> 00:38:19,981
...the court will appoint one for you.

I need to speak with the president
right now, please.

478
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:37,875
I'm sorry, this administration
isn 't familiar with an Agent Kellerman.

479
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:42,183
June, it's me.
I need to speak with Caroline now.

480
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:43,983
If you don't put me through...

481
00:38:44,093 --> 00:38:47,153
...I'll make certain the president knows
that you did not allow me...

482
00:38:47,196 --> 00:38:50,461
...to provide her with some very
important information. Now.

483

I'm sorry, this administration
isn 't familiar with an Agent--

Please leave a message after the tone.

485
00:39:09,372 --> 00:39:11,363
Bill, don't do this.

486
00:39:11,452 --> 00:39:14,580
I've dedicated my life to this country.
To Caroline.

487
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:16,486
Everything I have, I give.

488
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:20,270
Every photo. Every file. Get rid of it all.

489
00:39:20,284 --> 00:39:23,253
-Make him a ghost.
-I've been a perfect soldier.

490
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:26,091
I've never asked anything of you ever.

491
00:39:26,493 --> 00:39:28,791
But I'm asking now.

492
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:31,056
Bill, don 't do this.

493
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:40,261
-I don ' t see him.
-Trust me, we haven ' t lost him yet.

494
00:39:48,732 --> 00:39:50,791
Linc, stop the car.

495
00:39:50,877 --> 00:39:53,641
-What?
-We gotta stop the car.

496
00:39:59,804 --> 00:40:01,601
That's a radio tower over there.

497
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:04,662
It must be picking up
some kind of analog signal.

498
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,533
We gotta get closer. Turn around.

499
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:11,817
-What about your friend back there?
-lf we're gonna go down...

500
00:40:11,836 --> 00:40:13,360
...might as well go down swinging.

501
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,737
All right.

502
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:26,888
Come on, come on, come on.

503
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:33,811
We are in business. It's going through.

504
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:35,336
All right.

505
00:40:35,453 --> 00:40:38,013
Come on, Sara, pick up.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

506
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:03,437
Sara.

507
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:26,234
