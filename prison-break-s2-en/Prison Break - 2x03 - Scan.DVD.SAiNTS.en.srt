1
00:00:01,717 --> 00:00:03,150
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:05,415
Hey, y'all, we're headed out, man.

3
00:00:05,493 --> 00:00:07,120
Good luck.

4
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:10,156
-I hope you find the girl, buddy.
-Baby, what the hell's going on?

5
00:00:10,197 --> 00:00:12,665
Hector says that you could serve
your full sentence.

6
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:15,694
-What you doing here? Where's Maricruz?
-She's with me now.

7
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:19,926
What's this I hear about you coming home?
You getting your daughter's hopes up?

8
00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:21,723
You sitting down?

9
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,678
Your man is coming home this week.

10
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:25,563
We can make it
to the courthouse on foot.

11
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:27,951
You don't understand.
Everything is in that car.

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,710
I've been clean for 1 8 months now.

13
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:33,790
I wanna help people get
from where I've been to where I am.

14
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:40,471
You're right. I should never
have gotten you involved.

15
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:43,560
I just need to know
what Michael Scofield...

16
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:45,937
...wanted from you in exchange
for the green card.

17
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:49,441
Caroline, I've been doing this for 1 5 years,
it's never been about anything...

18
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:52,396
...other than you, your family
and most importantly, this country.

19
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:54,462
Now, I need to know
who I'm working for here.

20
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:56,483
You are working for me.

21
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:59,193
Are you aware of any arrangement
Officer Bellick had...

22
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:01,517
...with any inmate
regarding Prison lndustries?

23
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:03,284
Yeah, he sold it to John Abruzzi.

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,358
Officer Brad Bellick to be terminated,
effective immediately.

25
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:10,441
They just announced
the rewards on the TV.

26
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:14,285
-How much?
-A hundred thousand dollars apiece.

27
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:17,918
The money. Just outside of Tooele, Utah.

28
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,078
-I got him.
-He's on the wall!

29
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:23,107
Truck!

30
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:31,814
Get men at all the area hospitals. Wherever
they are, one of them's bleeding good.

31
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,195
-We gotta move.
-I can't.

32
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:41,744
Put in all that work, break out of prison...

33
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:44,475
...only to end up dead
at the bottom of a ditch.

34
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,160
Kind of sad, really.

35
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:48,346
So which one of them was it?

36
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:01,404
We got a blanket on all the hospitals.

37
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:02,721
Free clinics?

38
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:05,671
If they got Band-Aids and Bactine,
we got a body in there.

39
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:09,415
The brothers come in for a medical,
they're getting it in a van back to Fox River.

40
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,896
Anything break on the other six?

41
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,933
Eyes and ears on the families.
So far, no hits. Maybe just laying low.

42
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,561
What's the hardest thing
in the world for a con to do?

43
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:18,883
Nothing?

44
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:21,124
-Two things in life are certain, Miss...?
-Lang.

45
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:23,469
Death, taxes and the fact
that a man on the run...

46
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,771
...will make a mistake
in the first 72 hours.

47
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,939
Needing distance, he'll steal a car.
Needing money, he'll rob a store.

48
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,506
Needing help,
he'll trust someone that he shouldn't.

49
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:33,225
And when he does...

50
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,952
...he will leave behind the crumbs
that will take us right to him.

51
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:45,071
-I need your help.
-Michael, what are you doing?

52
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:47,372
-Cayenne pepper.
-What?

53
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:51,319
In your kitchen, do you have any?

54
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:52,988
Yeah, maybe.

55
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:56,977
I'm gonna need some rubbing alcohol,
some towels and painkillers.

56
00:02:56,981 --> 00:02:58,881
-Whatever you got.
-And some booze.

57
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,762
Please.

58
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:08,109
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

59
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:09,843
Easy.

60
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:15,302
It's fine, man. Let's just keep moving.

61
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:18,509
We keep moving
and that leg keeps bleeding.

62
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:21,814
That leg keeps bleeding
and we're not getting out of lllinois.

63
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:23,676
This is gonna hurt.

64
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:27,193
That's good, that's good, that's good.

65
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:30,894
This will seal the capillaries.

66
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,385
You should not have come here.

67
00:03:33,494 --> 00:03:35,428
The police have been here
asking questions.

68
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,772
We didn't have a choice.

69
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:40,616
I'm thankful for the help with the green card
but I just don't wanna get involved--

70
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:44,565
It wasn't part of our deal.
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

71
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:47,656
I'm sorry. There was nowhere else to go.

72
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:50,329
When I saw you on the news,
I was worried.

73
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,448
I just hoped you'd crossed
the border by now.

74
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:55,196
So did l.

75
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,524
Keep giving him these.

76
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:02,472
-See if you can find him some clean clothes.
-Okay.

77
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:05,094
I gotta go back and get our car.

78
00:04:05,174 --> 00:04:08,109
Forget the car. We can get another.

79
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,050
I don't need a car, I need that car.

80
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,361
Why?

81
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:18,611
Because in that car
is everything we need to disappear.

82
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,218
-What have you got?
-Here we go, boss.

83
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:01,911
One of the blues hauled in a vagrant
a couple of hours ago.

84
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:04,407
It seems the man was in possession
of an item or two...

85
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:06,699
...that didn't exactly belong to him.

86
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:19,087
Looks like we got our first mistake.

87
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:23,514
Season 2
Episode 3
Scan

88
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:04,591
Hey, you got any of that Oriental jerky?

89
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:06,492
Excuse me?

90
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:08,173
Teriyaki flavor.

91
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,322
No.

92
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,734
Well, you got any in the back?

93
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:15,474
Let me check.

94
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:18,802
And get me a bottle of that Early Times
while you're back there, junior.

95
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:22,671
Feel free to earn your paycheck today.
Watch the store, I'll be right back.

96
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,093
How goes it, Roy?

97
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:43,174
To be honest, Roy, I could've done
without the knee to the junk.

98
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:46,679
You bit me, Brad.
Like a little girl, you bit me.

99
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,543
-Well, you had it coming.
-Yeah, probably did.

100
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:54,984
You know, it's crazy, us taking it out
on each other for how things turned out.

101
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,160
You want someone to blame,
how about those convicts staring up at us...

102
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:00,290
...from the papers every morning?

103
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:05,557
They took my job,
my pension, my dignity.

104
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:08,788
When they went over that wall,
they took all of it right along with them.

105
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:11,255
Everything I worked for my whole life.

106
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,971
You see that reward they got?

107
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:16,938
Those ass-hats are worth more dead
than you and I are alive.

108
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,794
-Not for long.
-What do you mean?

109
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:23,353
I mean somebody's gonna get that money.
Might as well be me.

110
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,041
You know, a job like that...

111
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:29,955
...might go a little smoother
with an extra pair of hands.

112
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:32,405
You really think I'm gonna split
that reward with you?

113
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:36,030
I'm just saying, you run into those brothers,
two of them, one of you...

114
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:38,544
...you might find yourself wishing
for a good wingman.

115
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:54,987
Just get it done, Mike.

116
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:58,792
-How you doing?
-Can I help you?

117
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,303
Yeah, I hope so, Chuck.

118
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:04,161
I think you may have towed my car.

119
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:06,812
-What'd it look like?
-What did it look like?

120
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,950
The car you stole the backpack from,
what did it look like?

121
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:13,832
I don't know, man. Maybe it was gray.

122
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:16,744
-It's a gray Accord.
-License number?

123
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,484
Look, man, that's all I know.

124
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,515
I wasn't after the car.

125
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:24,658
-I thought the bag had some clothes in it.
-You remember where the car was parked?

126
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,288
Where'd you park it?

127
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,754
Corner of Hancock and 1 5th.

128
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:30,921
I don't know,
maybe around 1 5th somewhere.

129
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:33,991
-But it ain't gonna be there anymore.
-What do you mean?

130
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:36,801
That's the reason
I didn't get to grab anything else.

131
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,583
-Tow truck rolled up.
-Already on it.

132
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,693
Okay, it's gonna be 60 bucks
for the tow...

133
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:46,422
...and 24 for the overnight.

134
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,643
All right.
I'll be right back with your vehicle.

135
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,911
Shouldn't take but a few minutes.

136
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:15,435
-Hello.
-Petey, it's Sucre.

137
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:17,567
As in Fernando Sucre?

138
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:19,712
-ls there another one?
-Man, I hope not.

139
00:09:19,797 --> 00:09:22,630
But my boy, Sucre, would not be calling me
on the telephone...

140
00:09:22,677 --> 00:09:26,511
...thereby making me an accessory
to his dumb-ass escape, man.

141
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:30,453
I'm sorry, bro,
I just need you to get ahold of Maricruz.

142
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:33,644
I can't call her cell because the feds
will be all over the place.

143
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:36,586
Homes, listen, man,
you have got to forget about that girl.

144
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:39,563
If I could forget about her, pendejo,
I'd still be at Fox River...

145
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:41,698
...sitting in cell 40 on your old bunk.

146
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,649
I hope you're holding onto something tight
because I'm about to break it down for you.

147
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:49,384
She's getting married to Hector
on Saturday.

148
00:09:49,877 --> 00:09:51,708
-What day's today?
-Thursday, bro.

149
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:54,014
Sorry, man.

150
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:58,593
All right.

151
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,404
-You gotta get her to your place tonight.
-But hang on, man.

152
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:04,362
I got one last shot
to make her change her mind, dude.

153
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:06,669
Just find a way to get her there, okay?

154
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:09,266
Wait, Sucre, hang on, man.

155
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:43,982
About the broken window--

156
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:46,751
We got a disclaimer posted on the wall,
says we're not res--

157
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:50,707
I don't care about the broken window,
Chuck.

158
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,344
I had a backpack inside.

159
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:56,837
Not when we got it.

160
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,282
Got some paperwork for you to fill out.

161
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:05,076
You look familiar.

162
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:12,384
Yeah, you were the attending
when I first started here.

163
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:14,616
Sure.

164
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:18,407
Would one of you mind
calling me a cab, please?

165
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,586
I don't think so.

166
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:23,849
Look, Dr. Tancredi, l--

167
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:27,571
-I just wanna say good luck.
-Sara Tancredi?

168
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:29,866
-I'm sorry.
-You have the right to remain silent.

169
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:32,000
Please place your hands
behind your back.

170
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:34,279
If you have any questions,
I'm happy to come down.

171
00:11:34,356 --> 00:11:37,450
Ms. Tancredi, out of respect for your father,
I'm gonna ask you again.

172
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:38,720
My father?

173
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:41,965
I'm sure he'd prefer that this went
without incident.

174
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:45,338
You have the right to speak to an attorney
before you speak to the police.

175
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:48,698
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

176
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:53,094
You may have an attorney present
during questioning now or in the future.

177
00:11:53,556 --> 00:11:55,990
Caroline, they're taking her in.

178
00:11:57,077 --> 00:11:59,443
Of course, I'll keep an eye on her.

179
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:04,685
All you gotta do is sign here
at the bottom.

180
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,216
You'll be one your way.
Excuse me, please.

181
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:13,458
-Brewster's Towing.
-This is Agent Mahone with the FBl.

182
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:16,621
-Who am I speaking with?
-Chuck.

183
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:20,097
I wanna alert you to a possible situation.
Are you listening to me, Chuck?

184
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:22,881
An individual may be coming there
to inquire about a vehicle.

185
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:25,800
A gray Accord,
probably with a busted rear window.

186
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:29,974
Has anyone come by looking for a vehicle
that matches that description?

187
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,754
-Yes, sir.
-When?

188
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:43,297
Chuck, can you tell me
when he was there?

189
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:47,476
Right now.

190
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,694
Brewster's Towing. Scofield's there.

191
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,008
Chuck, stall him.

192
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,754
All units, Fox River subject 01 Scofield,
V-lD'd at Brewster's Towing.

193
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:06,607
It's my supervisor. He says I gotta
get clearance before I can release the car.

194
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,688
Chuck, you there? Hey, Chuck.

195
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:12,899
Come on. Come on, Chuck.
You still with me?

196
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:19,125
Yeah, that vehicle might not be here
when you get here.

197
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,990
You need to send somebody now.

198
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:22,668
Do not let him leave!

199
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:26,881
Oh, he got the keys.

200
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,645
-Where the hell are those units?
-Still six or seven minutes out, sir.

201
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,930
We got chatter. It's Franklin.

202
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:45,836
He's at a payphone downtown.
Mistake number two.

203
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:50,231
I know. Just let me explain, all right?

204
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:52,439
Were you ever even in the military?

205
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:56,880
I served my country
and my country served me up, all right?

206
00:13:56,885 --> 00:14:00,548
Now, look, I wish I could lay this
all out for you right here, right now.

207
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:04,197
But just know, baby, I am sorry
and I love you.

208
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:07,737
And when the time comes,
I will explain everything.

209
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:12,052
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't turn you in right now.

210
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,282
You know what? I'll give you three.

211
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:17,383
Me, you
and that beautiful little girl of ours.

212
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:20,455
Baby, look, I got a plan.

213
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,401
I got a plan that is gonna get us
some money...

214
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:28,917
...where you and I and the baby,
nobody can ever find us or bother us again.

215
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:32,683
You gotta trust me. That's all I need,
is the opportunity for you to hear me out.

216
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:34,589
All right?

217
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:38,904
All right.

218
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:45,843
All right, listen. Has anybody
tried to contact you about me?

219
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:48,358
-No.
-Okay.

220
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:50,996
Okay, that's good, that's good.

221
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:54,244
Listen.

222
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:56,418
In the Rainbow Room--

223
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,412
Restaurant, New York City.

224
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:03,978
--do you remember that beautiful spot
where we took that picture?

225
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:06,991
The one by the window?

226
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:17,168
I am going to be waiting
in that spot one week from now.

227
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,226
And that's all that I want...

228
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:23,471
...in this whole world, is for my two girls
to be waiting there for me.

229
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:27,100
-Do you understand what I'm saying?
-Look, I gotta go.

230
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:31,281
Baby, I just wanna know,
are you going to be there?

231
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:33,582
I don 't know.

232
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,488
But you know me.

233
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:36,936
-Do I?
-Yes.

234
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:40,715
Goodbye, Miles.

235
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:49,394
I'll alert the office in Manhattan.

236
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:51,757
Send Franklin's picture
to the Rainbow Room.

237
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:54,229
And go have a chat with his wife,
woman to woman.

238
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:56,784
Ask her why she never
visited her husband at Fox River.

239
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:59,150
Pretend you don't know,
the relationship is fragile.

240
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,415
We keep tapping the cracks
and she's gonna break.

241
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:03,892
Yes, sir. I appreciate the assignment.
I want you to--

242
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:07,051
Lang, I don't need gratitude.
I need leads, answers, progress.

243
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:09,755
Anybody that can't deliver that,
just don't even unpack.

244
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:11,508
-Clear?
-Yes, sir.

245
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:17,274
-Mr. Wheeler.
-Stand by.

246
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:20,333
Stay on Scofield. I want
the license plate number of that Accord...

247
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:22,307
...and I want you to get it out
on the wire.

248
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,289
-Yeah.
-Now.

249
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:26,659
I'll call you back.

250
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:33,496
What's going on?

251
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:37,911
Apparently, I wasn't the only one
looking for this car.

252
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:40,702
Great. Let's get out of here.

253
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:49,078
I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.

254
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,769
I mean, any more than I already have.

255
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,079
Good luck.

256
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:00,126
To you too.

257
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,623
So....

258
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:09,886
I'll see you.

259
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:12,152
I hope so.

260
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:28,320
-You all right?
-Yeah.

261
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:30,070
Good.

262
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:32,985
We're heading west,
toward the money, toward L.J.

263
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:35,523
Just got one more stop to make.

264
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:37,573
What for?

265
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,288
You trust me?

266
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,202
Of course, I trust you, Brad.

267
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:45,386
It's just that
if anybody finds out about this, l--

268
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:47,225
They won't.

269
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:53,151
Let me handle this.

270
00:17:57,908 --> 00:18:00,775
Humpty Dumpty climbed up a wall

271
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:04,416
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

272
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,633
Look, I already told the feds,
I don't know anything, okay?

273
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:11,892
Those suits with pedicures
and penny loafers? Why would you?

274
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,358
They got rules to follow,
codes of conduct.

275
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:16,548
They got jobs to protect.

276
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,063
-Now me, on the other hand--
-Come on, boss.

277
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:22,389
I swear, those guys
didn't let me in on any plans.

278
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,901
Are you telling me that in all
your little powwows in the yard...

279
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:29,335
...they never once mentioned
what they were gonna do...

280
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:30,920
...once they went over that wall?

281
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,791
That's right.

282
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:41,394
I may not work here anymore, big-uns...

283
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,975
...but I still got influence
with people who do.

284
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:49,183
People who will do whatever I ask them to,
to whoever I ask them to.

285
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:57,093
And a curvy man like yourself....

286
00:18:57,365 --> 00:19:00,357
Let's just say
there's some filthy individuals...

287
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:05,637
...who might enjoy a cellie
with womanly attributes.

288
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:11,950
Now, you're gonna tell me
everything you know...

289
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:14,286
...about where those convicts
are headed...

290
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:18,966
...or I'm gonna throw your fat ass
to the wolves.

291
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:25,781
Okay, thanks.

292
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,104
Mistake number three.

293
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:31,732
Someone reported seeing a man matching
Fernando Sucre's description stealing a car.

294
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:36,260
-Where?
-Defiance, Ohio.

295
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:39,446
Someone's going down today.

296
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,035
I know, mami. I know.

297
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:01,021
Sara.

298
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:04,403
-I paid your bail.
-You took your time.

299
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,496
-I'm the governor. I do have things that--
-Go to hell, Dad.

300
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:11,813
You keep this up, this may be
the only place I'll be able to see you.

301
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:14,092
Do you even wanna hear
my side of things?

302
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:16,360
Not particularly, Sara, no.

303
00:20:16,437 --> 00:20:20,533
Especially when I have no idea
whose side you're on.

304
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,296
But I do know this.

305
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,653
Somebody is gonna go down
because of what happened at Fox River.

306
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:28,099
And it would be in both
of our best interests...

307
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,772
...if that someone was not you.

308
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:32,462
But to ensure this,
certain steps need to be taken.

309
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,524
One, you should go
to a daily recovery meeting.

310
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:38,871
Two, you need to go before a judge
and plead not guilty.

311
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,390
-And three--
-Dad, I don't--

312
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,832
You need to tell the DOC
everything you know...

313
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,993
...about how that prison was being run.

314
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:48,204
And that Warden Pope,
how he was granting favors to Scofield...

315
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:50,804
...because Scofield helped him
with his personal projects.

316
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:53,132
Thereby exposing him
to certain restricted areas...

317
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:56,401
...where he may have been able
to obtain a key to the infirmary.

318
00:20:58,228 --> 00:20:59,456
I can't do that.

319
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:02,735
Oh, yes, you can, Sara.
You can do that and you will.

320
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:05,710
I did it, Dad.

321
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:10,162
I left the door open. Me, and no one else.

322
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:13,117
That's not true.

323
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:15,331
-Yes, it is.
-That's not true.

324
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:19,545
Sara...

325
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:23,032
...just do what you're told.

326
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:29,327
Otherwise, there will be consequences
that will affect us all.

327
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,683
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

328
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,504
Yes, sir.

329
00:21:34,805 --> 00:21:36,636
Good.

330
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,891
In one week...

331
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,313
...I will be appointed the new vice president
of the United States.

332
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,365
There will be a ceremony,
you will be invited.

333
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:48,997
You will not attend.

334
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:53,307
Goodbye, Sara.

335
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,575
-Let's put some music on.
-No.

336
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:13,314
Forgot. No radio.

337
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,488
Man, it's quiet out here.

338
00:22:15,604 --> 00:22:18,368
Inside, there was always noise,
you know.

339
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,981
Someone yelling, guards making rounds.
Kind of got used to it.

340
00:22:22,004 --> 00:22:24,837
You're right. We should go back.

341
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:32,329
The tats. They weren't just
for getting out, were they?

342
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:37,778
Breaking out was just the beginning.
Now it gets a little more interesting.

343
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,079
Because me being strapped to the
electric chair wasn't interesting enough.

344
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:44,373
All I'm saying, is inside,
we had the element of surprise.

345
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,770
No one knew what we were planning.

346
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:51,463
But there's something about this guy,
the one in the elevator.

347
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:54,417
It's like--

348
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:58,020
It's like he knows where we're going,
what we're thinking.

349
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:01,526
It's a matter of time before he
finds out about the money in Utah...

350
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:03,990
...Bolshoi Booze,
our way into Mexico.

351
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:07,040
Everything.

352
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:15,814
You ready for this?

353
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,884
Make the call.

354
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:25,418
Please leave a message.

355
00:23:25,492 --> 00:23:28,893
Hey. It's me.

356
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:32,630
I've got Linc. We're on our way there.

357
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:38,452
If, for some reason, you can 't make it,
call me back at 917-454

358
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:40,249
Just got this from surveillance.

359
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,776
You remember that voice mail Scofield
prepaid for when he went off to prison?

360
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:46,094
-Yeah.
-Someone just left a message on it.

361
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:48,655
-Who?
-Scofield.

362
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:50,783
Something about a meeting.

363
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:54,497
Sounded like he's waiting for someone else
to check the message, call him back.

364
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,178
This prefix, it's a cell phone number.
As long as it's on--

365
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:00,000
We can track exactly where he is.

366
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:25,308
Don't do anything stupid,
don't do anything stupid.

367
00:24:53,364 --> 00:24:54,888
Is there a problem, officer?

368
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:57,862
You know why
I pulled you over today, sir?

369
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,737
Speeding?

370
00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:02,763
Let me see your license
and registration, please.

371
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:06,429
The thing is, I lost my wallet.

372
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,540
Well, I guess your registration
will have to do just fine.

373
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:24,901
So this is your car, Mrs. Miller?

374
00:25:25,844 --> 00:25:28,608
Mrs. Miller's my wife.

375
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,150
I'm Mr. Miller.

376
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:35,633
Well, your tags are expired.

377
00:25:35,923 --> 00:25:37,891
I'll be right back.

378
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:03,613
Did he sing?

379
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:06,839
Like a fat, sweaty bird.

380
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:21,509
Hey, sweet pea.

381
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,145
-Daddy.
-Hey, come on.

382
00:26:24,724 --> 00:26:27,488
Oh, look at you, you're so big.

383
00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:31,872
I want you to do me a favor
and grab a piece of chalk...

384
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:35,052
...draw Daddy a picture
on the ground, okay?

385
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,330
So how you feeling, huh?

386
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:43,119
You keeping your appetite up?

387
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:46,132
Sort of, I guess.

388
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:50,197
That's good. That's real good.

389
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:54,423
Oh, God, it's so good
to see you, baby girl.

390
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,648
Do you understand what Daddy
is going through right now?

391
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:02,576
Sort of. But the kids at school
have been saying stuff.

392
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:04,650
Okay, what have they been saying?

393
00:27:05,236 --> 00:27:08,330
They're saying you're on TV
because you're a bad man.

394
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:12,612
And what do you think?

395
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:16,150
I think if I were some place...

396
00:27:16,212 --> 00:27:18,612
...and they wouldn't let me leave
to see you...

397
00:27:18,676 --> 00:27:20,405
...I wouldn't do what they said either.

398
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,208
You know what?

399
00:27:26,323 --> 00:27:28,757
We are gonna be together real soon.

400
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,048
I promise you.

401
00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:31,858
But Daddy needs you to do him a favor.

402
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:34,356
I need you to get a message
to Mommy, okay?

403
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,012
Okay.

404
00:27:36,116 --> 00:27:41,108
Now, I need you to tell her
if she understood what I told her...

405
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:44,134
...and if she is willing to trust Daddy...

406
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:50,260
...that she needs to turn
on the porch light at 7:00.

407
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,058
Okay? Can you remember that?

408
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:54,802
That's a good girl.

409
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,494
Dede, stay away from the gate, honey.

410
00:28:00,116 --> 00:28:03,108
Daddy gotta get going, okay, sweet pea?

411
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:09,602
-I love you, Daddy.
-I love you too, baby.

412
00:28:17,748 --> 00:28:19,477
There.

413
00:28:26,516 --> 00:28:28,143
It's not much further now.

414
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,375
Okay, they've moved off the interstate,
heading north on Route 38.

415
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:43,023
Talk to me.

416
00:28:44,435 --> 00:28:46,767
Where?
There's a patrolman who thinks...

417
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:49,930
...he has Fernando Sucre pulled over
outside of Latrobe, Pennsylvania.

418
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:51,766
Get in touch with the local dispatch.

419
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,795
Make it clear that we want this man
in custody, not in a body bag.

420
00:28:55,092 --> 00:28:59,461
Yeah, dead men can't tell us
where their friends are. You got it.

421
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:41,772
-Do you have a positive ID?
-It's gotta be. It looks just like him.

422
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:43,177
-Can you take care of it?
-Yeah.

423
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:44,649
-Okay.
-I'll take care of it.

424
00:29:44,756 --> 00:29:47,691
-Proceed with caution.
-I will.

425
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:57,121
Mr. Miller...

426
00:29:57,203 --> 00:30:01,139
...I'm gonna have to ask you to place
your arms outside the vehicle, please.

427
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:06,159
Mr. Miller, I need to see some hands.

428
00:30:38,995 --> 00:30:41,964
-You ready?
-Yeah.

429
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:44,640
Now.

430
00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:00,122
This is the one.

431
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,091
-You see him?
-Nope. Maybe he didn't get your message.

432
00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:21,912
They've stopped.

433
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:23,938
A couple of miles up ahead. There's--

434
00:31:24,276 --> 00:31:28,403
There's nothing up there.
What are they waiting on?

435
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,337
Or who?

436
00:31:35,412 --> 00:31:37,573
All right, that's good, that's good,
that's good.

437
00:31:58,388 --> 00:32:02,119
Oh, come on. Come on.

438
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,517
Go red. Now! Go red!

439
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,127
There's one more thing.

440
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,422
You trust me?

441
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,653
Of course.

442
00:32:41,748 --> 00:32:43,943
How do you throw the hunter
off the scent?

443
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:46,262
Get rid of the prey.

444
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:51,475
Remember, once I hit scan, we'll have
about 30 seconds before it reaches 1 03.7.

445
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:52,806
Then she blows.

446
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:56,079
-That's right. Ready?
-Yeah.

447
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:15,469
All right, let's go.

448
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:21,476
Wait.

449
00:33:21,587 --> 00:33:24,488
The music's not changing.
Wait, wait, wait.

450
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,996
Something's wrong.

451
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:29,844
What happened?

452
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,909
I don't know,
but we're gonna need that explosion.

453
00:33:36,212 --> 00:33:38,009
He's here.

454
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:40,374
He's here.

455
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:51,260
The radio must've jammed.
We're gonna have to set it off manually.

456
00:33:51,668 --> 00:33:53,260
The car could blow any second, Mike.

457
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:55,661
The feds are gonna be here
in about two minutes.

458
00:33:56,051 --> 00:33:58,542
If it doesn't look like we're dead,
we will be.

459
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:00,579
Rock, paper, scissors.

460
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,992
-Linc.
-It's my turn.

461
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:20,191
Better pray for reception.

462
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:31,938
How many stations
between 1 02.1 and 1 03.7?

463
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:37,093
Way out here? Just one, probably.

464
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:17,157
Where's Maricruz?

465
00:35:17,268 --> 00:35:19,395
-Hey, look, man--
-No, no, no, Petey, you look.

466
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:21,705
I haven't slept in 72 hours.

467
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:23,713
I've seen a man's hand
get chopped off...

468
00:35:23,795 --> 00:35:28,884
...I've been shot at, dug up a grave,
stolen a car, jumped on a freaking train.

469
00:35:28,884 --> 00:35:30,715
So please, just tell me where she is.

470
00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:32,735
Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.

471
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:35,344
I was trying to tell you
but you hung up the phone, man.

472
00:35:35,412 --> 00:35:36,879
The wedding is in Vegas.

473
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:41,055
-The city?
-Yeah.

474
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,233
And they left a few hours ago, bro.

475
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,943
Now, wait. No, no, no.

476
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:56,094
Come on, man. Hey, Fernando.

477
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,613
It's pristine, man. It's just--

478
00:35:57,715 --> 00:35:59,706
Gonna be back to you in one piece,
I promise.

479
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:01,888
Can we go back to the part
where I said no?

480
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:04,371
-I wish I had another choice.
-You do have a choice.

481
00:36:04,435 --> 00:36:08,428
I mean, come on, man.
It's a 1 952 Ural motorbike.

482
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:12,098
-Bro, if you so much as scratch it--
-I won't scratch it, I promise.

483
00:36:14,835 --> 00:36:17,429
She's the love of my life, bro.

484
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,007
I gotta do something.

485
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:22,759
-You look like hell, man.
-Been through hell, papi.

486
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:26,069
Now, I just gotta get to Vegas.

487
00:36:34,803 --> 00:36:37,704
Hi, I'm Sara, and l....

488
00:36:44,563 --> 00:36:48,192
Over the years, I've worked
with more than a few people...

489
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:49,735
...who had a history of addiction.

490
00:36:49,843 --> 00:36:51,777
And...

491
00:36:52,564 --> 00:36:57,001
...I would tell them that I could understand
what they were going through...

492
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:58,932
...because I used to be just like them.

493
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:01,326
I used to be an addict too.

494
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:04,435
And I think....

495
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:09,868
I think that what's becoming clear
to me is that...

496
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,093
...the reason I understood them
is because I am like them.

497
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:18,102
I never used to be an addict.

498
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,992
I....

499
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:24,751
Hi, my name is Sara and I'm an addict.

500
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:26,980
Hi, Sara.

501
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:33,190
Hi, my name's Lance and I'm an addict.

502
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:35,167
Hi, Lance.

503
00:37:36,563 --> 00:37:39,760
I guess a lot of what Sara
just said resonates with me...

504
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:41,285
...in what I'm going through.

505
00:37:43,571 --> 00:37:45,869
Put in all that work, break out of prison...

506
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:48,635
...only to end up dead
at the bottom of a ditch.

507
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:50,818
Kind of sad, really.

508
00:37:50,899 --> 00:37:52,526
So which one of them was it?

509
00:37:55,955 --> 00:37:57,422
Shales.

510
00:37:57,523 --> 00:37:59,252
Shales?

511
00:37:59,347 --> 00:38:01,508
Scofield. Might be Scofield.

512
00:38:01,587 --> 00:38:04,454
Probably gonna find his brother
in there too.

513
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,277
Oscar Shales is this guy
Mahone tracked for a while.

514
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:11,570
Nasty little bottom feeder,
you know the type.

515
00:38:11,603 --> 00:38:13,264
He's still in the wind.

516
00:38:13,363 --> 00:38:15,729
Can't get them all, right?

517
00:38:37,587 --> 00:38:40,715
We should have a pretty clear path
to Utah now.

518
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:43,280
They'll turn their attention
to the other guys...

519
00:38:43,347 --> 00:38:45,838
...which means we'll be off their radar
for a while.

520
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,432
They're gonna get the lab results back
from the accident.

521
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:50,364
We'll be in Mexico by then.

522
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:52,282
Provided the transport comes through.

523
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:03,371
Oh, come on, baby.

524
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:17,167
In the Rainbow Room...

525
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:22,835
...do you remember that beautiful spot
where we took that picture?

526
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:25,463
The one by the window?

527
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:32,329
I am gonna be waiting there
in that spot one week from now.

528
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:05,184
She sleeping okay?

529
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:08,211
Yeah, like a baby.

530
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,902
Good.

531
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:15,335
So you said you had some information
you wanted to tell me about your husband?

532
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,979
Looks like I owe you another one.

533
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,383
-It's okay.
-Okay.

534
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:34,784
Well, once we get to Mexico,
I'll send you 1 0,000...

535
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:38,796
...Iike I promised,
plus another 3 for the car.

536
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,795
Are you meeting up with her?
Your doctor?

537
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:44,124
Sara?

538
00:40:46,995 --> 00:40:48,826
I don't know.

539
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:52,203
We should get moving.
Next town's a few miles away.

540
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:55,542
That's fine.
I can catch a bus from there.

541
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,516
Thanks again, Nika.

542
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:18,149
I knew the little whore
would take us right to them.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
