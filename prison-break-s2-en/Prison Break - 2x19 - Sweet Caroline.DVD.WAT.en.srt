1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:03,364
-Previously on Prison Break:
-Let me get this straight.

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,097
Brothers come to a city that's 1 5 miles
from the prison they escaped from. Why?

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:10,572
The president's in Chicago to make
a speech, they're up to something.

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,735
Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

5
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,005
-So we blackmail her.
-ln exchange for what?

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,581
A presidential pardon.

7
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,549
We gonna keep crying about money
you've got coming to you?

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,585
-Or do you wanna make some more?
-I'm listening.

9
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,053
Ever been to Mexico?

10
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,215
When's the meal coming? I'm starved.

11
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,386
Freshen me up when you get a chance.

12
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:32,531
Fernando. Fernando.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,767
-Check this bag for you, sir.
-Oh, no, that's coming with me.

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,138
Sir, I know that bag is way over
the weight limit for carryon.

15
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,968
Your bag will be safe.

16
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:46,579
They're watching you.
But from where? There.

17
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,442
President Reynolds ruined your life,
she ruined my life.

18
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,878
You wanna take the bitch down?

19
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,713
You found your inside man,
but it's gotta be right now.

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,219
Have either of these men checked in?

21
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,323
Yeah. Room 1 006.

22
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,925
Later you'll get a package in your
cell. It's from me.

23
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,153
I need you to use it, okay?

24
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,782
Open on 4.

25
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,453
I need a hand in here.

26
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:43,196
-I need a medic in B-4.
-Let me die.

27
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,700
No.

28
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,840
-Let me die.
-Save your breath.

29
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:57,513
A large crowd is gathering along Wabash
Avenue here in downtown Chicago.

30
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,847
They're anticipating the arrival
of President Caroline Reynolds...

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,717
... who continues her tour with an
appearance at the Grand Carlisle Hotel.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,293
Inner Circle approaching the south
perimeter. Mark One.

33
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,993
Marker Two.

34
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:17,695
Marker Three.

35
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,370
Okay.

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,172
I think you better go.

37
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,374
-You sure?
-Yeah.

38
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,418
Thank you for your help.
There' s nothing more you can do for us.

39
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:35,747
Doesn't feel right.

40
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,254
I don't think you want any part of this.
Thank you.

41
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,160
-It's 1 0 minutes away, right?
-At least.

42
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:51,096
Listen, this doesn't work,
we're gonna need a way out.

43
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,671
-For good.
-Well, that's on you.

44
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,840
Yeah. What about Derek?

45
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,208
-Derek Sweeney?
-Yeah.

46
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,377
-You think he'll be up for this?
-Yeah.

47
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,350
All right.

48
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,080
This is your neck of the woods.
You wanna meet at the park?

49
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,821
-How's Third and Racine?
-Third and Racine.

50
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,094
3:1 5, the corner.
I'll be there.

51
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,466
If anything happens...

52
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,361
...I love you both.

53
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,541
Key.

54
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,649
Go, go, go.

55
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,203
Sit down.

56
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,412
When were they here?
Five, 1 0 minutes?

57
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,115
-They were never here.
-They were here. I know.

58
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,650
Where did they go?

59
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,817
-I don't know.
-No, you do know.

60
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,222
He decided it was for the best
and I couldn't take this anymore.

61
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,556
-It's over, just like that, huh?
-Yeah.

62
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,598
It's over like you flew to New Mexico on a
dead woman's lD to meet up with him?

63
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:45,101
Or it's over like when you met up
at the train station in Evansville?

64
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:49,230
Or maybe like the day today, when you
checked in this hotel here two hours ago.

65
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,673
-Which one?
-I don't care if you believe me or not.

66
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,677
-I'm telling you the truth.
-No call. He's not gonna call you?

67
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,907
Don't lie to me.
You don't wanna do that.

68
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,350
Excuse me, can you tell me
where to find...?

69
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,212
Hey. Hey, hombre.

70
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,680
Hey.

71
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,387
Hey, I need the phone.

72
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,322
Listen to me, man.
It needs to be today.

73
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,463
My family is in trouble, all right?
There's a man out there...

74
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,565
-...trying to hurt my--
-Your family's fine.

75
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,725
-There's nobody after your family.
-Look at me, man.

76
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,700
Look, I'm not crazy, okay?

77
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,434
I know the rules.

78
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,176
I wouldn't be asking you
if it wasn't an emergency.

79
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:11,071
Please, just let me use that phone.

80
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,246
Please.

81
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,254
-Agent Lang.
-Yeah, yeah.

82
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,920
I-- I need to speak to Mahone, please.

83
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,860
-Can I have him return?
-Listen, this is Benjamin Miles Franklin.

84
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,470
And I need to speak to Mahone
right away.

85
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,135
-It's Franklin for Mahone.
-I'll take it.

86
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,448
This is Agent Wheeler.
I don't believe we've met before.

87
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,084
I need to speak to Mahone.

88
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,916
Something I can help you with?

89
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,290
Listen...

90
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,784
...I wanna leave a message for him.

91
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,459
You tell him.

92
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,661
You tell him that I'll do what he wants
me to do, okay?

93
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,132
I just need a little bit more time.
I'll do it.

94
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,294
Just don't hurt them.

95
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,972
You hear me?
Don't hurt them.

96
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,174
What's up?

97
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,177
Excuse me.

98
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:54,213
-Are you crazy? What are you doing here?
-Keep your voice down. Keep it down.

99
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,119
How you been? You all right?

100
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,388
-It's good to see you, man.
-You too, brother.

101
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,431
If the guys knew you were here,
they might not be cool about it.

102
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,865
I ain't hanging around, man.
I need a favor.

103
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,029
-You owe me.
-I do. You know I do.

104
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,767
Look, it's....

105
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,838
Look, it's just your situation right now.
I mean, I just had a kid, a baby boy...

106
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,210
-...and l-- I promised Maria--
-I didn't come here to cause trouble.

107
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,578
I'm short on friends.
I need you to hook me up.

108
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,915
You're the only one who can do it
without the green up front.

109
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,650
I'm serious about this, man.
Here. I need it.

110
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,793
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

111
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,665
-By when?
-ASAP.

112
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,773
-Tomorrow? The next day?
-Now.

113
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,712
Now.

114
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,182
All right, Linc. Come with me.

115
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,313
Stand by. Marker six.

116
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,817
Escort team, stand by.

117
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,091
Okay, stand by for exit.

118
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,967
Seven clear.

119
00:12:58,744 --> 00:12:59,938
Approaching hotel entrance.

120
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,876
Everything looks clear.

121
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,720
-He's over the line. Got him.
- Take him. Take him down.

122
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,163
-Get some hands on that guy.
-Hold it still.

123
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,302
-Detain him. Detain him.
-Get him on ground.

124
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,631
Talk to that guy.

125
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,037
Who saw him go down?
Any press?

126
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,578
We got him down pretty quick
but you never know.

127
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,580
-Somebody may have gotten a shot.
-Check around.

128
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,109
Confiscate cameras if you need to.

129
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,880
Put out a statement
before rumors get started.

130
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,790
And get everyone out of here.

131
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,056
-Now.
-We're still waiting for the response from--

132
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:30,465
You and I both know that this situation
requires us to abandon protocol.

133
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,803
I don't know what you need to tell them,
but I need your men to leave.

134
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,799
Now.

135
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,437
Yes, sir.

136
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,250
Where's your brother?

137
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,218
-I need to see the president.
-Really?

138
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,058
And you think that's a possibility?

139
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,026
-She'll want to hear what I have to say.
-Oh, I highly doubt that.

140
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,305
The only person you get to talk to...

141
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,600
...is me.

142
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,639
And the only way you're gonna live
through the next hour...

143
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,939
...is if you tell me where to find
your brother.

144
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,748
Okay.

145
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,155
-He's in a safe place.
-Be more specific.

146
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,957
Specifically...

147
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,320
...a place you will never find him.

148
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,107
I had the honor...

149
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,939
...to attend Mountbrook
Military Academy...

150
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,809
...whose mission it is...

151
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,286
...to ensure the greatness of this country,
its future leadership...

152
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,186
...encouraging patriotism...

153
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,051
...building a strong moral foundation
and providing the service of men...

154
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:10,231
...committed to the values of honor,
freedom and country.

155
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,231
But, first and foremost...

156
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,567
...they taught you this.

157
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,026
How do you say "cherries" again?

158
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,025
Looks like you have
to get more cerezas.

159
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,101
Mami, I got you a hundred pistachios.

160
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,501
-With the right amount of salt too.
-Well, it's a combination. I need both.

161
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,240
Why am I sucker for you, huh?

162
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,956
-What? What's she saying?
-That looks like T-Bag.

163
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,463
What?

164
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,306
He said he was trying to steal luggage
from the airport.

165
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,911
He's got five million dollars.
Why would he--?

166
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,579
Unless he doesn't have it.

167
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,154
Unless he lost it there.

168
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,690
-Stop it, Fernando.
-What?

169
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,920
Do you really believe that that money
is at the airport?

170
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,931
Hey, forget it. Look at what
we have together.

171
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,161
Do you really wanna risk that?

172
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,505
We have everything that we need.

173
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,001
-Except your cerezas.
-Right.

174
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,580
I'll be right back.

175
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,315
Fernando.

176
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,390
Baby. I'll be right back.

177
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:57,191
You gotta know it's not real
hard for me to recognize a junkie.

178
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:02,072
I-- l-- I'm saying you don't look so good.

179
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,001
I'm fine.

180
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,672
You mind me asking what you're taking?

181
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,052
-Here, you want one?
-No, that's okay.

182
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,319
Save it for later.

183
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,790
Varatril.

184
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,296
Benzodiazepine's a
hard-core tranquilizer, man.

185
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,301
Take these every day?

186
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,374
Twenty milligrams.

187
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,178
You must feel like you're walking
underwater.

188
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,846
I do.

189
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,841
It's very quiet down here.

190
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,521
That's why you started, right?
The peace and quiet?

191
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,657
That's not why you do it anymore
though, is it?

192
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,359
Now it's the headaches, right?
And you probably don't sleep.

193
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,363
And you know you're gonna
destroy yourself, right?

194
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,802
I haven't ruled that out as a possibility.

195
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,939
Hope we hear from your boyfriend.

196
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,783
There's one difference between
me and Agent Mahone.

197
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,851
He doesn't know the value of a bird in the
hand. He keeps beating around that bush.

198
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,687
But if you don't give up Burrows,
I don't care.

199
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,432
-One down, one to go.
-I need to talk to Mr. Scofield.

200
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:38,895
Alone.

201
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,568
Madam President.

202
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,865
Could l...

203
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,074
...have a word?

204
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,617
It wouldn't be prudent for me to leave you
alone with Mr. Scof--

205
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,481
My men are right outside this door.
I have a right to privacy.

206
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,816
Your rights...

207
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,184
...aren't my first concern.

208
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,452
Do I need to remind you
who you are talking to?

209
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,997
Step outside and close the door
behind you.

210
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,691
The things you do for your brother.

211
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,858
It's impressive.

212
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,664
I could say the same for you.

213
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,592
-But I won't.
-Bear in mind...

214
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,670
...your opinion means little to me.

215
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,004
This tape.

216
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,705
You have it with you?

217
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,812
No.

218
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,880
But I can arrange for you to hear it.

219
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:37,919
You don't make arrangements for me,
Mr. Scofield.

220
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,524
I have people for that.

221
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:45,085
I'm not exactly sure
what is on this tape...

222
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,096
...but I doubt it's of any interest to me.

223
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,429
It's a recorded conversation
between you and your brother.

224
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:56,233
Well, out of millions of conversations that
I had with my brother during his lifetime--

225
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,376
I'll narrow it down for you.

226
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,973
It was recorded sometime after his death.

227
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,081
And this...

228
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,685
...particular conversation...

229
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,214
...you might wanna keep in the family.

230
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,162
And where is it?

231
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,858
Twenty different copies
in 20 different locations.

232
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,736
I can call my brother right now.

233
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,599
He can play it for you.

234
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,901
Not on the phone.
Have him bring it here.

235
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,905
These are the terms.

236
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,975
You can hear it over the phone...

237
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,078
...or you can hear it on the news.

238
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,183
It's up to you.

239
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,428
You know, it's why I started.

240
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,654
Started what?

241
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,326
Using. Same reason as you.

242
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,367
Why? Because you had to stay up
all night during residency?

243
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,332
Because the bass player dumped you
in front of the whole sorority?

244
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,635
Yeah, you and I got a lot in common.

245
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,478
I've seen people die too.

246
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,245
I'm assuming you didn't make them die.

247
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,679
You need help.

248
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,448
Not what I'm looking for.

249
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,621
For your sake, I hope your boyfriend
calls back real soon.

250
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,790
Maricruz?

251
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,963
Where the hell's everybody?

252
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,061
Mami?

253
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,643
Hey, lookie here. Good old Sucre.

254
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,747
What'd you do?
Where are they? Maricruz.

255
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,611
Hey, hey, hey.
Keep your cap on.

256
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,775
Out picking apples
for the Snuffaluffagus.

257
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,619
-lf you ever--
-Calm down.

258
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,382
They're gonna walk back in here
any minute.

259
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,489
Which means trouble.

260
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,296
Unless you wanna see me try out the new
T-20-Z on your bella muchacha Mari-poon.

261
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,129
I think you better come with me.

262
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,841
Yeah?

263
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,406
Lincoln Burrows?

264
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,413
Caroline Reynolds.

265
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:55,216
I understand you have something for me.

266
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,124
-You still there?
-Oh, I'm here.

267
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,027
It's good to finally talk to you.

268
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:09,797
Wish I had the chance one of those
242 nights I spent on death row, you--

269
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,994
Please, just play the tape.

270
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,515
It's awful, I know.

271
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:29,183
But the choice was clear. You needed
to be far away from all of this.

272
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,812
I am. I'm the Isle of Terrence,
far off to sea.

273
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,482
But I'm still here for you.

274
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,891
Now, listen to me.
Don 't dwell on the negative.

275
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,123
Some people
deserve to dwell, Caroline.

276
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,268
You know I'm only a phone call away.

277
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,128
And three thousand miles.

278
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,239
Do you know how cold it is here?

279
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,642
We talked about this, Terrence.

280
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,909
You knew that you would be lonely,
but it's only temporary.

281
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,451
His appeals process has started already.

282
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,556
This is gonna fly by quicker
than your 20s.

283
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:09,319
And soon the world will forget
all about him...

284
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,463
...and they'll forget about you too.
I promise.

285
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,098
But...

286
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,996
...it' s killing me not being able
to see you...

287
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,105
-...sweet Caroline.
-I wanna see you too.

288
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:26,004
-But that can 't happen right now.
-This house is so big.

289
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,737
I just-- I just think of you...

290
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,748
...Iying in bed.

291
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,380
-I know. Me too.
-Your warmth, your touch.

292
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,223
Was it quick...

293
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,834
...when he killed himself?

294
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,370
Well, it was a lot quicker
than how my father died.

295
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,506
They shot him in the back.

296
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,673
He died in my arms.

297
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,712
I just wanna know what happened.

298
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,307
Your brother apologized.

299
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:12,086
He said he was sorry and then he blew
his brains out all over the wall.

300
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,086
It was quick...

301
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,194
...and it was his decision.

302
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,525
And now it's time for you to make yours.

303
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:32,932
No, no, no, no. Man, you know,
l-- I can't-- I can't do it. I can't do that.

304
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,472
Yes, you can.

305
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,379
There's nothing to be afraid of.

306
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,273
You don't get it, do you?

307
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,384
You can't stop this guy.

308
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,321
Not without your cooperation, I can't.
But if you talk to me...

309
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,386
...if you tell me what's going on,
I can take care of you, okay?

310
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,622
You've gotta trust me, Mr. Franklin.

311
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,233
I can help you.

312
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,065
C-Note, right?

313
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,136
Yeah, whatever.

314
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:12,672
All I need you to do is tell me exactly
what Agent Mahone told you.

315
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,113
If you give me Mahone,
I'll give you your life back.

316
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,553
God's been smiling down on me,
I can tell you that.

317
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,660
First I caught up to Haywire
up in Algoma.

318
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,695
He did a dive off an elevator
before they could put him away...

319
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,425
-...but I still get the reward.
-Wait, wait. He's dead?

320
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,934
Yep. Like a gnat on a Peterbilt. Hope you
don't take the same route, Sucre.

321
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,733
-Hell, no. I got plenty reasons to live.
-I hope a few of them are in Fox River.

322
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,139
Or maybe if you play nice, I'll throw
your Maricruz a couple of bills.

323
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,779
-After I turn you in.
-How much are you getting for us?

324
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,678
A hundred grand. I bet you never thought
your ass would be worth all that.

325
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,682
Wait, wait, wait.

326
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,823
What if I know where you can
get 5 million dollars?

327
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,994
You heard me.

328
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,163
-Where is it?
-I could take you there...

329
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,096
...if you didn't have to take me back
to the States and turn me back in.

330
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,600
Where is it?

331
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,210
T-Bag's in town.

332
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,305
I made my commitment a long time ago.

333
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:23,818
I agreed to put my country ahead of myself,
like a mother does for a child.

334
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,224
And I thought...

335
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,921
...that what I was doing was noble
and that I would be rewarded.

336
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,257
You were wrong.

337
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,596
Don't you see
that I'm a pawn in this too?

338
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,102
The power that has taken over
this country...

339
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:46,004
...is like a cancer
and it will stop at nothing.

340
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:50,077
-lt is out of my control.
-So is this.

341
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,175
Tell me what you want from me.

342
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,043
Uncuff me.

343
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,614
-I don't have the keys.
-You'll get them.

344
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,918
Second, I want you to arrange for me
to walk away from here alone.

345
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,754
No surveillance.

346
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,421
Okay.

347
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,230
And finally...

348
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:14,795
...I want a presidential pardon for me
and my brother...

349
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,101
...fully exonerating us
of all our crimes.

350
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,369
And I want it today.

351
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,790
I can't just hand out pardons
to anyone I choose.

352
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:37,689
-There is a process, rules.
-This is no exception.

353
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:41,161
A document will be delivered for
your approval just like any pardon.

354
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,163
You'll sign it and then file it...

355
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,428
...with the attorney general,
who'll submit it to Presidential Record.

356
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:49,869
Fine. I will sign whatever
you need me to sign.

357
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,703
That's very kind.
But we both know that's not enough.

358
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,970
What do you want from me?

359
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:58,343
I will unlock you myself,
walk you out of here.

360
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,916
What, you want me to drive you
to the airport?

361
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,350
I guess I'm not as trusting as I used to be.
Especially with paperwork.

362
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,456
It's so easy to lose.

363
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,422
Now, I want you to go out there
in front of everyone...

364
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,927
...and announce our full pardon
on live TV.

365
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,095
You're insane.

366
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,599
That is not the way things are done.

367
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,136
This is not a vacuum.
People will ask questions.

368
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,833
Pardon. On stage. Now.

369
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:34,376
And how do I know that you won't
release the tape an hour later?

370
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,220
You don't.

371
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,014
You'll just have to take my word for it.

372
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:45,255
-Well, I need more than that.
-Well, you're not gonna get it.

373
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,024
Caroline...

374
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,797
...it's time.

375
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,439
Make your choice.

376
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,382
Adams, I need you to uncuff the detainee
and bring him here to be released.

377
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,683
What are you doing?

378
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:16,087
I am going to make an announcement
pardoning Mr. Scofield and his brother...

379
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,990
...and he will walk away unharmed.

380
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,255
Are you out of your mind?

381
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,826
He has brought some indisputable
evidence to light.

382
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,268
We could end this all, right now.

383
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,736
You're gonna let them walk?

384
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:34,276
I am the commander in chief,
and you are a corporate lackey.

385
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,739
I am making the calls now.
You have no authority.

386
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,948
My men will see to it...

387
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,647
...that Mr. Scofield walks away
without the interference...

388
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,917
...of you and your pit bulls.

389
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,126
-You alone?
-Yeah.

390
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,159
-How'd you do?
-Three tickets, one cabin, one way.

391
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,767
Nice.

392
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,969
-I owe you.
-No. We're even.

393
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,766
-These are for you.
-Nice.

394
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,674
And this.

395
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,076
-What's this?
-Eddie. When you broke out...

396
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,682
...he bet me a hundred bucks
you'd be caught in a week.

397
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,876
I said, no way. Not the Linc I know.

398
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,112
Figured I'd split it with you.

399
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,823
So this is it, huh?

400
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,891
Yeah.

401
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,628
Good luck.

402
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,297
-You take care. All right.
-You too.

403
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,561
You be safe.

404
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,395
-This is your neck of the woods.
-Yeah. How's Third and Racine?

405
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,259
I'll be there.

406
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,001
I don't wanna do this. I really don't.

407
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,837
What are you talking about?

408
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,276
You can't say that I didn't give
you a choice...

409
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,348
...you never
take the easy way. You--

410
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,082
And I noticed that about you. You--

411
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:59,053
I should never expect it to be any different
but I have a job to do...

412
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,420
...a job that I'm being made to do.

413
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,085
Pick it up, Sara.

414
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,825
Sara, pick it up.

415
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,563
-Pick up.
-Wait, wait.

416
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,163
Don't move.

417
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,571
Just don't-- Don't move.

418
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,870
Okay, I need the phone.
Give me the phone.

419
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,341
Stay right where you are, please.

420
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,853
You don't really wanna do this.

421
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,353
You don't know the first thing about
what I want.

422
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,634
-You got my message?
-Yeah.

423
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,880
-I got her.
-She's on her way out.

424
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,909
Follow her. She'll take you
right to Scofield.

425
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,972
Sir...

426
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,472
...we need to talk.

427
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,446
In just a few minutes, the president...

428
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:35,347
...is going to announce a pardon
for Burrows and Scofield.

429
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,079
As you're well aware,
this is quite a departure.

430
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,686
She's always been willing to play ball
but I think we need to take some action.

431
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,593
Sir...

432
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,297
...I hate to disturb you...

433
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:55,770
...but I'm not sure you realize the gravity
of what she's about to do.

434
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,288
-Michael.
-Sara.

435
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,496
-lt worked.
-The pardon?

436
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,732
She's announcing it any minute.

437
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,068
Oh, my God.

438
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,739
Oh, my God. Michael, that's amazing.

439
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,807
Just get here, okay?

440
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,405
I'm on...

441
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,213
...Highland. It's a warehouse
that runs right down to the water.

442
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,749
Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way.

443
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,189
-We did it.
-Yeah?

444
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,063
What happened to your face, man?

445
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,361
If you wanna take the ride...

446
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,730
...you gotta buy the ticket.

447
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:38,270
Yeah, right. Well, Derek hooked us up
with a cabin on one of those freighters.

448
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,338
South America via the Great Lakes.

449
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:45,539
Well, we're not gonna need that.
But this is appreciated.

450
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,843
One more time, bro.

451
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,953
-We did it?
-It's done.

452
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,954
I wish I could've seen the look
on her face.

453
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,890
No, you don't.

454
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,756
Oh, yeah, I do.

455
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,666
-Unbelievable.
-She's gonna do it.

456
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,669
Unbelievable.

457
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,214
The president is now taking the stage
here at the Grand Carlisle Hotel.

458
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,443
The 2-hour delay in her appearance...

459
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,454
...due to an investigation characterized
by Press Secretary Ryan Berg...

460
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,184
...as " an over-zealous fan "....

461
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,397
-You are not going to do this.
-I'm afraid I am.

462
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,868
-Developments you need to be aware of.
-I have made my decision...

463
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,133
...and I would appreciate
you not second-guessing me.

464
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,608
I don't think you understand.
We know your secrets too.

465
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,509
We can reveal them just as easily.

466
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,319
You need to ask yourself who you
fear more. Michael Scofield...

467
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,179
...or us?

468
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,419
-You've got 30 seconds.
-Yeah.

469
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,354
I won't keep you.

470
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,560
-The world is waiting.
-Ten seconds.

471
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,459
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

472
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:13,968
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

473
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,869
...four, three, two....

474
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,543
Thank you for waiting so patiently
all afternoon.

475
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,509
If it were not for the support
of this great state...

476
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,881
...my home state of lllinois...

477
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,050
...I would not be here today.

478
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,891
Which is why I have chosen today...

479
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:45,195
...to make
this very important announcement.

480
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,530
A situation has recently come to light...

481
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,574
...and I feel that I must take action.

482
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:57,275
It is my job as president of this
great country...

483
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,076
...to make rational decisions...

484
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,219
... when I am given facts.

485
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:08,214
Decisions that are best not for me
but for the people.

486
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,855
And so...

487
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,055
...after much consideration...

488
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,463
...I regret to inform you...

489
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:23,935
...that I have been diagnosed with
a highly malignant form of cancer.

490
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,707
And because of that reason...

491
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:36,148
...I am no longer fit to serve
as your commander in chief.

492
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:41,921
In the best interest of this country,
effective immediately...

493
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:48,162
...I am stepping down
as president of the United States.

494
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,931
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a shocking announcement....

495
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,165
If she ain't the president,
the tape's useless.

496
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,604
She can't pardon anyone.

497
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,437
We got nothing.

498
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,209
--she will no longer serve
as the president.

499
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,943
There's only one thing we can do.

500
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,421
We gotta disappear.

501
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,526
Forever.

502
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,758
