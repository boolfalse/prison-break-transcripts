1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,396
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,766
I'm breaking out. And you're gonna
make sure my brother goes with me.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,270
I'm sorry, Henry.

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:14,409
This message is for Maricruz. I'll be there
in the airport in lxtapa waiting for you.

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,278
Sucre, down the road, if you're in trouble,
post a note on the message board.

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,614
-What's it called?
-Europeangoldfinch.net.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,915
That's a bird, right?

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,253
Go pack your things. We're moving.

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,726
We will be a family if it kills us.

10
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,762
Pull this off and you're halfway home.

11
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,866
You remember what home is like,
don't you?

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,559
Stay away from my family.

13
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,539
She needs that medicine.
She can't go two days without it.

14
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,201
-I don't feel good.
-Oh, sweetie.

15
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,936
I want for this to be over.

16
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:50,549
That makes two of us. A question of
looking at whatever your father gave you.

17
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,945
It's just a key.

18
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,281
It's locked in a box inside that cigar club.

19
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:59,551
I'm not a wanted fugitive.
Give me the key. I'll do it.

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,591
Wanna take a walk?

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,315
Ms. Tancredi.

22
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,259
I need to have a word with you.

23
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,405
-Ms. Tancredi.
-Of course.

24
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,137
Ms. Tancredi? Ma'am?

25
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,118
-Ms. Tancredi?
-It's time to go.

26
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,521
Ma'am?

27
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,149
They're going out back.

28
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,696
Come on.

29
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,310
Pediatrics, please.

30
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,113
-Hello?
-Cameron.

31
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,350
-Hi, Dad.
-How you doing, big guy?

32
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,223
-Good. I'm eating my lunch.
-Oh, how is it?

33
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,727
Pretty disgusting.

34
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,663
Maybe your mom can bring you
some dinner from home.

35
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,530
-Did you see the doctor today?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,901
He said I could go home this week,
as long as I stay out of the street.

37
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,736
You're a smart young man.
You know how to cross the street.

38
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,503
Are you mad at me?

39
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,146
Listen to me.

40
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,417
No one is mad at you,
and this wasn't your fault.

41
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,420
I should've been looking out for you.

42
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,923
You weren't even there.

43
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,027
But I should've been.

44
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,730
Oh, man. Hey, buddy, listen, I gotta go.
But I'll call you back later, okay?

45
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,869
-Okay. Bye.
-Cameron.

46
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,061
I love you.

47
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,597
Cam?

48
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,978
Yeah? What have we got on Franklin?

49
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,637
Nothing new since this morning.

50
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,841
Another witness from the Minnesota
diner robbery gave a positive lD.

51
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,987
Good, because I just landed
in Minneapolis 1 5 minutes ago.

52
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,419
-Anything else?
-Yeah, the girl, Dede.

53
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,617
Apparently, she's been ill.
Some chronic condition.

54
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,161
Fax Franklin's mug shot to every hospital
in southeastern Minnesota.

55
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:56,132
Already done. With any luck, she'll get sick
enough to need one and he'll show his face.

56
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,334
-You don't have kids, do you, Lang?
-Nope.

57
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,266
Call me when you have something else.

58
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,675
I'll take that.

59
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,618
-We didn't get it.
-What?

60
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,481
And we need to get back in there soon.

61
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,714
Once the Company finds out Sara
was in there...

62
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,154
...it won't belong before
they start wondering why.

63
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,420
Find a spot close to the club and sit tight.
We're gonna take the car.

64
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,860
-Be back in a couple of hours.
-Where you going?

65
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,229
Turns out that maybe there's one member
of that club who can help us.

66
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,165
Who?

67
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,700
Pope?

68
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,574
Just a minute.

69
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,745
Henry.

70
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,544
What are you doing here?

71
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,049
Aside from jumping bail
and evading the authorities?

72
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,951
There's something that you need to hear.
But first, I need to know if you'll listen.

73
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,955
Sara, we've got nothing to discuss.

74
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,357
Please, I need five minutes.
After that, if you want us to, we'll leave.

75
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,894
Who's us?

76
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,773
-I don't want any trouble.
-Good. Because that's not why we're here.

77
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:46,571
What the hell are you thinking about,
waltzing in here? You're a wanted criminal.

78
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,976
In case you've forgotten,
I dedicated my career...

79
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,242
...my entire life, to keeping people
like you behind bars.

80
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,512
You're talking about guilty people.
My brother is innocent.

81
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,623
-We have the evidence to prove it.
-I don't care. I want you out.

82
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,955
It's in a locked box at the Corona
de Oro Club and you're a member.

83
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,461
-Out.
-Henry, please listen.

84
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,896
Sara, I'm tempted to say
you should've known better.

85
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,697
But after what you did--

86
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,771
My father was looking into
the Burrows case when he was murdered.

87
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,932
This key is the only thing
I could recover from his body.

88
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,791
Where are we going?

89
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,131
They're hungry.
We've been driving all day.

90
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,303
Chick-O-Stick.

91
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,170
They need real food.

92
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,538
Soon enough, pumpkin.

93
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,583
Alackaday.

94
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,693
Miscreants. Defilers.

95
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,094
Defacers.

96
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,928
Despoilers.

97
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,112
What is this?

98
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,939
My home.

99
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,329
Oh, no, no, no.

100
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,233
Oh, really, no.

101
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,524
Okay. All right, sweetie,
why don't you sit over here, okay?

102
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:33,229
All right. I'm gonna go over there
and I'm gonna talk to the lady, all right?

103
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,773
So you need anything? You sure?

104
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,501
Okay.

105
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,909
-Yes?
-My daughter, Dede, she's really sick.

106
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,849
She's had this kidney thing
since she was real young.

107
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,488
-It's on the left--
-Where is she?

108
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,317
She's sitting right there.

109
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,016
-Have you been here before?
-No. We're from out of town.

110
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,627
Can I see your insurance card?

111
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,260
No. No, I don't have any insurance.

112
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,164
After I left the Army,
they discontinued my insurance.

113
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,067
Are you a resident of Hennepin County?

114
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,298
Like I said, we're from out of town.

115
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,673
Do you have a driver's license?

116
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:16,838
Look, I don't have a driver's license,
an insurance card or anything like that.

117
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,507
But I do know the law.
You have to see my little girl.

118
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,354
-I'm gonna go get my supervisor.
-Good.

119
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,959
I don't give a rat's ass about you
or your brother.

120
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,123
I trusted you. I took you under my wing.
I treated you like my own son.

121
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,632
I believed you.

122
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,433
Day after day, you lied to me.
What kind of a man does that?

123
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,468
-A desperate one.
-Yeah.

124
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:49,672
Well, you two made
a big mistake coming here today.

125
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:54,047
You gave me no choice.
I'm gonna notify the authorities right now.

126
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,052
I'm sorry...

127
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,391
...but I can't let you do that.

128
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,601
I don't wanna hurt you, Henry.

129
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,604
-Said by the man with the gun.
-lf it's the way I can convince you, so be it.

130
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,140
Well, you're not gonna convince me
by doing that.

131
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,904
-I'm not the man you think I am.
-I have a pretty good idea who you are.

132
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,345
If that's true, then you already know
I never wanted to be in Fox River.

133
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,044
I never wanted to meet you, Henry.
I certainly didn't wanna ruin your life.

134
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,051
Yeah? You've done
a pretty damn good job.

135
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,487
You're not saying anything to him
I haven't said myself, Henry.

136
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,253
I've looked into this.
What he's saying to you is true.

137
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,694
I just want my brother's life back.
I want people to know the truth.

138
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,197
I'd give anything for that.
I'd lay down my life.

139
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,269
That's easy for you to say,
standing on that side of the gun.

140
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,704
What if I'm standing on this side?

141
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,412
There are places
that can better serve your needs.

142
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,646
-Look, I know my rights, okay?
-This isn't a primary care facility.

143
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,348
We provide necessary care
in life-threatening situations.

144
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,585
I know. Are you gonna wait until
she's dead before you give her help?

145
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,424
-ls that what you're telling me?
-I'll not argue with you.

146
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,930
This is a hospital,
not a homeless shelter.

147
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,069
A what?

148
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,332
What did you just say to me?

149
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,608
I can't believe you people.

150
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,973
Come on.
The line is a little bit too long, okay?

151
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,684
We'll go somewhere else.

152
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,519
Where are we going?

153
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,523
We gotta find another doctor, sweetie.

154
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,024
My God.

155
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,528
Let's go.

156
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,258
Move!

157
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,777
Hold on, baby.

158
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,483
Franklin!

159
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,720
Thank you for riding
the Minneapolis Auto Train.

160
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,157
-Move out of the way!
-Please disembark quickly.

161
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,957
FBl! Stop! Stop!

162
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,831
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

163
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,195
All right. Look.

164
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,801
-Baby, you gotta get down.
-No.

165
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,375
-No, no, you gotta get down.
-You gotta let him go.

166
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,206
-Get down.
-You gotta let him go.

167
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,813
-Come on.
-No.

168
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,778
The doors will be closing momentarily.

169
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,249
-She's not letting go.
-Don't let her pay for your mistakes.

170
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,717
You hear me?

171
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,166
I could shoot you right now
and not even think twice.

172
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,865
But you won't.

173
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,774
You've spent too much time around prisons
to throw your life away like that.

174
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,245
-What the hell are you trying to pull?
-It's simple.

175
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,613
That's the key to an innocent man's
freedom. Come on, Henry.

176
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,686
We both know there's something
going on here.

177
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,585
Too many people have died.
Look me in the eye.

178
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,590
Tell me you don't believe
there's a cover-up going on right now.

179
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,355
I've got no moral obligations here,
Michael.

180
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,058
As far as I know,
Lincoln is as guilty as hell.

181
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:33,433
Then take a 1 0-minute drive with me
and we'll find out. That's all I ask.

182
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,871
Henry, you've looked into this before.
You've thought about it.

183
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,942
I have.

184
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,142
And I've come to one conclusion.

185
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,580
This has nothing to do with me.

186
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,712
But I am a man of the law...

187
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,822
...and right now, I've got a convicted felon
standing inside my house.

188
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,989
Well, maybe there's something I can
offer you to make you change your mind.

189
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,719
What do you intend to do with us?

190
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,752
Dumb grease monkey.

191
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,726
You don't deserve minimum wage.

192
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,263
The hell I don't. Working graveyard?

193
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,594
There ain't no man
who deserves more pennies...

194
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,829
...on the dollar per hour
than they got lQ points in his head.

195
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,906
I ain't stupid.

196
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,542
Seems equal stupid as the rest of you.

197
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,669
Seems to run in the genes.

198
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,044
Teddy.

199
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,778
Ten synonyms. Pick a word.

200
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,686
Pick a word.

201
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,154
Destroy.

202
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,958
Ten synonyms for destroy.

203
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,234
Annul.

204
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,241
Mutilate.

205
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,079
Liquidate. Abrogate.

206
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,084
Quell. Ravage. Expunge.

207
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,213
Demolish. Extirpate. Extinguish.

208
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,824
-You see that?
-Stupid, my pail.

209
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,589
My boy's gonna be president.

210
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,314
How come you ain't studying?

211
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,224
Because I'm tired.

212
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,022
Because I feel like a circus freak.

213
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:28,129
Well, now...

214
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,938
...it's in your own best interest.

215
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,037
Don't you understand that?

216
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,950
Now, you gonna be president someday.

217
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,188
You mark my words.

218
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,133
Theodore.

219
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,002
Theodore, do you hear me?

220
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,009
What are you gonna do with us?

221
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,227
We're gonna put down some roots.

222
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,867
You wanted me dead, Paul.

223
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,436
Just following orders.

224
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,869
You sent me to the chair
for something I didn't do.

225
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,839
All for your president.
You were willing to do that.

226
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:44,611
-Just following orders.
-Steadman said you loved her.

227
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,217
Steadman was a deranged man
that lived in a locked box.

228
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,287
You don't love someone
that loves power more than life.

229
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,185
-Bitter, huh?
-Am l?

230
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:59,626
No offense, but you're not capable
of understanding the relationship.

231
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,498
Okay, any way you look at it,
there is no light at the end of this tunnel.

232
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:14,135
One way or another, you and l, we die.
Your brother too.

233
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,248
Which is a shame,
given all he's done for you.

234
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,377
I have a sister I haven't talked to
in 1 5 years.

235
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,884
-You think she's better off for it?
-We'll make it.

236
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,488
-What is that, faith?
-Yeah, that's faith.

237
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,489
All I see is a black hole.

238
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,461
And sooner or later,
they're gonna suck each one of us into it.

239
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:39,571
But when they come for me, I'm gonna
take as many of them with me as I can.

240
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,408
She must have really
broken your heart, Paul.

241
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,376
President Reynolds attended
a Chicago fundraiser last night...

242
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,073
...as part of her two-day stop
in the Windy City.

243
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,742
Reynolds ' popularity continues
to soar in the Midwest...

244
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,855
...with appearances scheduled
in Indianapolis, Detroit...

245
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,923
...and Flint, Michigan later in the week.

246
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,957
A t a Democratic fundraiser
in Milwaukee....

247
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,561
Mr. Kim,
Sara Tancredi surfaced in Chicago.

248
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,528
She was spotted at the Corona de Oro Club
about an hour ago.

249
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,931
-Corona de Oro Club?
-It's a cigar club. Her father was a member.

250
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,833
He kept a private humidor there.

251
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,772
Get me a jet to Chicago.

252
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,556
Tell me you're not still thinking
he's gonna show.

253
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,857
He's let you down so many times.
You know that.

254
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:18,435
Maybe it's the baby in me that's telling me
that this time, it's gonna be different.

255
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:22,937
I don't mean to burst your bubble,
but he's not gonna show.

256
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,745
Bubble's not burst!

257
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,851
-I got three words for you.
-Yeah?

258
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,885
We gotta run.

259
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,920
We'll see you, Theresa.

260
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,008
-I'm so glad you came.
-You're crazy.

261
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,811
How did they know?

262
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,267
You're certain?

263
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:31,899
-About what's in the box?
-No. But it's all we've got.

264
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,942
Thank you, Henry.

265
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,619
You sure about this?

266
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,854
Nope.

267
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,660
Either way, you still owe me dinner.

268
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,570
Is that so?

269
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,036
Yep.

270
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:05,802
First week in Fox River, you promised me
if you got out, you'd take me to dinner.

271
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,810
Well, maybe after we wrap this up,
we can stop off...

272
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,505
...and get you a burrito
on the way back to Pope's house.

273
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,241
I don't know what you're used to...

274
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,751
...but anything short of a filet mignon
is not gonna cut it with me.

275
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,792
It's a date.

276
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,025
Give me the phone.

277
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,070
-Hey.
-How'd you pull it off?

278
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,305
-I'll tell you later. Is he in yet?
-Yep.

279
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,473
This shouldn 't take more
than a couple minutes.

280
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,278
Any longer than that,
we'll know we've got trouble.

281
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,215
Good afternoon, Mr. Pope.
Right this way.

282
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,482
Thank you.

283
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,187
-Mr. Pope.
-Hey, Warren. How's it going?

284
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,231
You hear what happened this morning?
Sara Tancredi came in.

285
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,561
Yeah, so I heard.

286
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,500
Well, next time,
don't let her get away.

287
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,401
Thanks.

288
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,691
Excuse me. You mind if I borrow
your computer for a moment?

289
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,427
-No problem.
-Thanks.

290
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,174
Pitch in, chitlins.

291
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,910
We can't do this. We can't live here.

292
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,954
Of course, not like this.
We gonna clean. We are cleaning.

293
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,351
We gonna rebuild.

294
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:37,154
You can't do this to them. Look at them.

295
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,161
You all mind coming along here
for a minute?

296
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:50,602
Come on. I think we're past me waving
that gun around, don't you think?

297
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,377
In here. Now, come on.

298
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,615
-What are you doing?
-Nothing is gonna happen to them, Susan.

299
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,013
Suzy Q.,
do you think I'd bring you here...

300
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:04,314
...to so sacred a place to me as this,
if I meant you ill?

301
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,514
Look at me!

302
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,488
I am not the animal
you think you see before you.

303
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:17,194
I am the laws of karma
all come down wrong.

304
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,496
-Don't you understand?
-I don't.

305
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:28,440
What I'm trying to say...

306
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,741
...is that I am the sin of my father.

307
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:38,449
-Why are you telling me this?
-Because I love you.

308
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,683
Because I want you to understand me.

309
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,955
I am the last in the line of Bagwells.

310
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,929
The tail end of a corrupted breed.

311
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:54,261
The earth, thank God,
shall see no more of our generations.

312
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,217
I cannot procreate, Susan.

313
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:14,791
And yet there's something in that
that gives me great hope.

314
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,086
No more Bagwells shall roam this planet.

315
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,355
Not with that vile blood in their veins.

316
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,331
All I wanna do is end that bloodline,
extirpate it...

317
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:27,028
...and start another afresh.

318
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,934
-A new family.
-Oh, Teddy.

319
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,541
Those children are my salvation.

320
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,037
My chance to make this world
a better place.

321
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,947
I will be good, Susan.

322
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,018
I will love them. I will love you.

323
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:48,649
I will take communion,
be baptized under a truer light.

324
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:55,756
All I ask is that you love me back,
just a little.

325
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,304
Or learn to do so in time.

326
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,032
Can you do that, Susan?

327
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,383
I can't.

328
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,780
I can't.

329
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,265
I'm sorry.

330
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,945
Please. Please.

331
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,313
Teddy, please. Oh, God.

332
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,015
Teddy.

333
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:58,392
Teddy, please.

334
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,957
Teddy, I'm sorry.

335
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,729
I can do it, I can do it....

336
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,850
-Where are we?
-At the doctor's office, sweetie.

337
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,255
Hello? Hello.
I have an emergency in here.

338
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,164
Hello?

339
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,345
Hello.

340
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,546
-Hey, you the doctor?
-You need to wait your turn.

341
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,018
No, it is my turn.
This is an emergency right here.

342
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:02,785
I need you to look at my daughter, okay?
Now, she's not feeling too good.

343
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,054
Please.

344
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,361
Here, sweetie. Hold on.

345
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,331
I'm sorry.

346
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:14,528
Hey, look,
this is all the money I got, okay?

347
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,106
That's $400.

348
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,775
Please look at my daughter.

349
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:29,981
-What's the matter with her?
-She has a kidney disease. PKD.

350
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,385
Normally, we have it under control,
but I don't like what I'm seeing now.

351
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,459
She's having stomach hurts, okay,
she's always hot.

352
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,562
-How's her appetite?
-It's gone.

353
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,257
-She's always tired. Ain't that right, baby?
-All right.

354
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,593
Hop up here.

355
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,795
Thank you.

356
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,271
Okay, he just wants to take
a good look at you, okay?

357
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:57,278
-I may need to run a few tests.
-Hey, just do what you have to do, man.

358
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,814
I'm gonna be right here, okay, baby?

359
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,748
Okay.

360
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,959
-Yeah?
-What's going on now?

361
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,493
He's still in there.

362
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,426
This is taking too long.

363
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,862
Wait, wait, wait. Here he comes.

364
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,674
-What's happening?
-We got company.

365
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,811
Hello, Henry.

366
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,159
-Didn't know you were a cigar man.
-Who are you?

367
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,762
A friend. A colleague, in fact.
We're both in law enforcement.

368
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,058
I'm not anymore.

369
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,634
That's right. You're retired.

370
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,865
-You know that guy?
-Yeah.

371
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:04,072
Looks like the lifestyle's treating you well.
Socializing over Cubans and cognac.

372
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,682
But that's not what you were doing,
is it?

373
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,419
Henry?

374
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,224
You don't mind if I ask you
to empty your pockets?

375
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,660
-As a matter of fact, I do.
-I'm not gonna play any games, Henry.

376
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,500
We both know why you came here today.

377
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:29,436
I suggest you get out of my way,
young man.

378
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,844
I can't do that.

379
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,777
Unless you'd like to cause serious trouble
for yourself and your family...

380
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,082
...I advise you to hand over
whatever it is you found.

381
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,856
Now.

382
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,527
Michael--

383
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,708
Get in!

384
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,232
Let's go! Linc!

385
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,845
Sara!

386
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:14,133
It's okay, it's okay. Easy, easy.
It's okay, it's okay.

387
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,914
Ma'am, you all right?

388
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,215
I don't understand.

389
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,979
We got a call. Someone said
there was a hostage situation here.

390
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,548
No one knew we were here.

391
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,472
Are you okay? Okay.

392
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,915
So, what's going on?

393
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,577
I'm afraid your daughter
shows signs of renal failure.

394
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,752
Has she ever had hemodialysis?

395
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:06,727
No. Hemo--? No, no.
This has never really gone that far.

396
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,758
What, are you planning
on doing it right here?

397
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,871
We're not set up for it. Neither is she.

398
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,339
But there is a county dialysis clinic
a few blocks away.

399
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:25,449
But we're going to have to place a catheter
in her neck, so she can be examined.

400
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,948
Hold still, sweetie. This'll be a little cold.

401
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,179
It's okay, baby.

402
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,963
Wait, wait, wait. What is that?

403
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,033
It's a trocar.
It's used for placing the catheter.

404
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,261
Lie down, honey.

405
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,668
-Do we really have to go this far?
-Look....

406
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,115
I'm doing the best I can here.
But you gotta understand something.

407
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,750
Your daughter is sick.

408
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:04,547
Now, this may look like
a desperate measure because it is.

409
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,596
This is gonna hurt a little bit, sweetie.

410
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,594
Stop! Stop.

411
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,294
Come on, baby.

412
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,763
Come on, baby. I can't do this.

413
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,020
What's going on?

414
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,185
I made a deal with Pope.

415
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,331
You made a deal with Pope?
What kind of deal?

416
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:56,439
If he came with us,
and if we got what we needed...

417
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,668
...I said I'd turn myself in.

418
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,040
What? We don't even know
what this thing is.

419
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:05,046
It could be nothing, Michael.
You know about this?

420
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,143
Not until it came out of his mouth.

421
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,684
It was the only thing I could think of.

422
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:13,847
You two can still finish this.
You'll just have to do it without me.

423
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:18,021
I'm not gonna let you do this, Michael.
There's no coming back from this.

424
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,597
-Now, look.
-What's the holdup?

425
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,030
Your brother's right.

426
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:29,263
I wouldn't count on the courts
to show you any leniency in this.

427
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,676
That doesn't matter.
I said I'd hold up my end of the deal.

428
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,278
You already did.

429
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,051
I listened to this.
You have something here.

430
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:45,244
There are gonna be a lot of people
who wish you didn't, but you do.

431
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,414
-Listen, Henry--
-I'd go now, if I were you.

432
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,586
And don't consider this forgiveness.

433
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:54,629
In fact, I'm about 1 0 seconds away
from changing my mind.

434
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,826
Thank you.

435
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,117
Okay.

436
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,688
Here, let's....

437
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:25,455
Let's tuck you in, all right? Okay?

438
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,234
Come on, let's go.

439
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,703
Listen, let's just sit
for a little bit longer, okay?

440
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,118
We're gonna go in a little bit, okay?

441
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,874
You know Daddy loves you
with all his heart, right?

442
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,475
I love you so much.

443
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,238
I'm so sorry.

444
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,942
I'm so sorry, baby.

445
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,866
-Yeah?
-I got a call for you.

446
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,598
I'll call back.
I just heard from some clinic up north.

447
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,106
They had contact with Franklin
half an hour ago.

448
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,608
I think you want to take this.

449
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,512
Put it through.

450
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,981
Yeah? Mahone.

451
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:57,484
-ls this the man in charge?
-Oh, yeah.

452
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:04,151
My name is Benjamin Miles Franklin.

453
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,488
And I wanna turn myself in.

454
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,566
But I got one condition.

455
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,396
My wife, well, she goes free.

456
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,165
My little daughter, she needs her mother.

457
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,970
I don't think I need to make
a deal with you, Mr. Franklin.

458
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,040
What if I got something you need?

459
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:09,390
Your wife was released an hour ago.
She'll be here soon.

460
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,393
Promise me that she will be okay.

461
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,667
Just hold up your end of the deal.

462
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:25,638
I will.

463
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,406
I'll get you Scofield.

464
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,427
Here we go.

465
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,942
You think it's a conversation?

466
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,511
