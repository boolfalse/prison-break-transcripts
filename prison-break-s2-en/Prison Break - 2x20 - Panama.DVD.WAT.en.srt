1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,863
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,369
I want a presidential pardon
for me and my brother.

3
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,803
Tell me what's going on,
I can take care of you.

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:12,570
All I need you to do is tell me exactly
what Agent Mahone told you.

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:16,978
I have a job to do, a job that I'm being
made to do. Pick up the ph--

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,243
Wait. Stay right where you are.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,418
Hey.

8
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,862
I know where you can get it.
Five million dollars.

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,628
-Where is it?
-I could take you there...

10
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,363
...if you don't have to take me
to the States, turn me in.

11
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,204
-Three tickets. One cabin, one-way.
-Nice.

12
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,812
Sir, in just a few minutes the president
is going to announce a pardon...

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,242
...for Burrows and Scofield.

14
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:52,408
I regret to inform you,
I am stepping down...

15
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,918
...as president of the United States.

16
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,579
There's only one thing we can do.

17
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,920
We gotta disappear. Forever.

18
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,233
E. STAMMEL

19
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,125
Very heavy.

20
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,230
What have you got in there?

21
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,094
About 75 pounds
of none-of-your-business, Pedro.

22
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,859
For your troubles.

23
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,675
Go, go, go!

24
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,856
T-Bag, T-Bag.

25
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,686
T-Bag, please, I need that money.

26
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,159
-Andale, you son of a bitch.
-Please, please.

27
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,025
I'm begging you. Please.

28
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,496
Please. No.

29
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,342
What time does the ship leave?

30
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,275
Ten minutes.

31
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,374
I can't believe we're running again.

32
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,278
-It's different now, man.
-You think so?

33
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,009
Yeah. We brought the bitch down.

34
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,711
-She stepped down, Linc.
-Because of us.

35
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,756
And yet you're still wanted for murder.

36
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,353
When you came to Fox River,
remember what you said?

37
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,862
You said, " I'm gonna break you out
of here." I'm alive. You did that.

38
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,432
You wanna look for the good,
you look there.

39
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,899
Come on,
let's just finish what you started.

40
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,215
Continuing with our top story,

41
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,146
Caroline Reynolds
made the announcement...

42
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,377
...just a short while ago
that she is stepping down...

43
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,454
...as president of the United States.

44
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,523
We'll be bringing you more information--

45
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,522
-Hello?
-Hey, are you all right?

46
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,894
Yeah, I'm fine. I just heard
about the president. What does it mean?

47
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,625
It means it's time to go.

48
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:24,964
Okay. When?

49
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,039
-Ten minutes. How far away are you?
-Five.

50
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,201
Listen, Sara, Linc and I are on the ship.

51
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,647
This is it.
There's no turning back now, so....

52
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,943
I know it's not what you wanted
from your life...

53
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:43,248
...but in case you're interested,
there is room for one more.

54
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,259
Michael Scofield, you asking me
to sail off into the sunset with you?

55
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,396
Well, it's more of a freighter, but yes.

56
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,625
I'll be there.

57
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,491
I'll see you soon.

58
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,501
She's heading west on Leadwell.

59
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,114
All right. Stay on her.
I'll be right there.

60
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,017
What the hell's this?

61
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,155
I tried, boss.
You saw how he just took off.

62
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:20,452
The only thing I'm seeing is an escaped con
who's begging to be taken norte.

63
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,060
Okay. Okay, look.

64
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,686
Maybe we could call the cab company
and find out where T-Bag was dropped off.

65
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,425
Yeah, now you're talking.
I saw some phones--

66
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,262
What's it gonna take for you
to forget you ever found us?

67
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,464
There ain't enough pesos in TJ.

68
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,944
-Are you sure about that?
-Go ahead, shoot.

69
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,705
But it might not be the best idea...

70
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:45,180
...seeing as how I'm the only one
who knows where your chiquita's tied up.

71
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,285
Where is Maricruz?

72
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,353
If I tell you, I'm as good as dead.

73
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,116
Of course, if you shoot, so is she.

74
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,992
-You're bluffing.
-Am l?

75
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,958
Let me tell you in words
you might be more familiar with.

76
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,230
She's in the hole. Enough food and water
to last about three weeks.

77
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,873
Any longer than that,
your sweet little plum's...

78
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,906
...gonna dry up like a raisin.

79
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,374
-lf anything happens to her, so help me--
-Help you?

80
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,207
The way I see it,
it's you who's gotta help me.

81
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:19,044
You ain't getting your hands on that girl
till I get my hands on that money.

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,585
Guess that makes us partners.

83
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,692
Clear the dock of any obstructions.

84
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,487
Here we go.

85
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,860
She's not here.

86
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,374
Yeah?

87
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,535
Sara, what's the matter?
The ship is leaving.

88
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,451
-Michael....
-What's wrong?

89
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,189
Sara?

90
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,761
I'm already onboard.

91
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,430
I'm sorry, I must've just missed you.
Where are you?

92
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,600
-We're on deck.
-Great.

93
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,303
I'm on my way up. Love you.

94
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,810
We good?

95
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,583
Yeah.

96
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,065
You have the right to remain silent.

97
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,674
Son of a bitch.

98
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,237
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...

99
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,846
...one will be provided for you.

100
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,578
Where is he?

101
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,310
-I don't know.
-No more games, Sara.

102
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,682
-You were on your way to see him.
-No, I wasn't.

103
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,950
You were just compelled
to flee the custody of a federal agent?

104
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,963
All lines astern are loose.
Prepare for cast off.

105
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,001
I couldn't find her.

106
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,301
Sara. We gotta go back.

107
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,002
-There's nothing you can do.
-Always something we can do.

108
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,771
Not this time.

109
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,509
Not this time. It's done.

110
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,809
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,548
-Scofield or prison?
-I just wanted a doughnut.

112
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,756
Get her a doughnut.
Can we get her one?

113
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,864
Get her a doughnut.
Get her a dozen doughnuts. Lock her up.

114
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,464
May, May, May, New Mexico.

115
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,243
Don't, don't, don't....

116
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,060
Where the hell did you go, Michael?

117
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,861
So where the hell is Mahone?

118
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,335
I don't know.
He's been MlA for the last week or so.

119
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,532
You think he knows
I've been barking up one of his trees?

120
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,778
Mr. Franklin, good afternoon.

121
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,313
This is Richard Sullins,
director of internal affairs at the FBl.

122
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,614
Which means whenever one
of our people does something wrong...

123
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,346
...it's my job to make it right.

124
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,121
How right are we talking about?

125
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,781
Well, let's be clear.

126
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,824
You are a convicted felon.

127
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,992
You broke out of a state penitentiary.
I can only do so much.

128
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,029
Well, there's only so much I can say.

129
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,691
Now, I'm sorry
if I seem a little bit skeptical...

130
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,236
...but the last time a federal agent
came up in here offering me a deal...

131
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,967
...there was a string attached
that I was supposed to put around my neck.

132
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,577
I've been authorized
to offer you a reduced sentence...

133
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,180
...in exchange for your testimony
against Agent Mahone.

134
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,077
Instead of 1 8 years,
you get 1 8 months.

135
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,649
Eighteen months?

136
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,082
Hey, you know what?
That man tried to kill me.

137
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,245
So as soon as he finds out
that I'm singing...

138
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,482
...I probably won't even last 1 8 days.

139
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,492
-Mr. Franklin--
-He threatened my family.

140
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,994
Now, I need to be out there
protecting them.

141
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:12,768
So until you can offer me something
like that, I'm not testifying to a damn thing.

142
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,670
Guard.

143
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,433
Free man.

144
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,040
You and your family.

145
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,678
Witness protection, fresh start.

146
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,117
-Clean record?
-Spick-and-span.

147
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,526
You put that in writing
and you got yourself a witness.

148
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,168
Sir?

149
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,404
I knocked, but....

150
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,206
You okay?

151
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,249
What does that look like to you?
There, right there.

152
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,545
-It's a triangle.
-Yeah, I thought so too.

153
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,749
How about this? Right there.

154
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,951
It's the mathematical symbol for pi.

155
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,256
Three-point-one-four.
I'm thinking date, area code.

156
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,662
Three-one-four, that's Missouri.
So you think Scofield's there?

157
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,201
I doubt it.
How's your Greek alphabet, Agent Lang?

158
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,237
I don't know. I guess it's....

159
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,472
What if I told you that triangle was a delta?
And that this--

160
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,614
This here was not the symbol pi,
but the letter.

161
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,612
I didn't see those
in the photos of the tattoos.

162
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,310
They weren't. We pulled these
from his original sketches.

163
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,853
They're off the hard drive.

164
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,960
Scofield numbered the steps of his escape.
That's how he kept everything in order.

165
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:48,192
But it looks like that he didn't use numbers,
that he used letters, like....

166
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,033
The sketch of this tattoo.
Allen Schweitzer.

167
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,798
Marked with an alpha, first letter
of the Greek alphabet. First step in his plan.

168
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,034
Epsilon, fifth letter of the
Greek alphabet. Fifth step in his plan.

169
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,236
Here's theta, kappa.

170
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,643
How about that? Tau.
Be at the border, right?

171
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,785
-Getting closer to the end. You with me?
-So you think....

172
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,180
His omega.

173
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,949
-The last letter of the Greek alphabet--
-ls the last step of his plan.

174
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,552
What is that? Christ in a flower?

175
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,890
-Rose.
-And these numbers, 61 7.

176
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,157
Could be biblical. Chapter six, verse 1 7.

177
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,961
Six-one-seven, 61 7. June 1 7th.

178
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,303
-Oh, what's today?
-Fifteenth.

179
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,772
-So whatever his last step is--
-It's gonna happen in two days.

180
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,889
-What's he saying?
-Nothing, the same as the rest.

181
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,152
Maybe he don't comprende.
What's Spanish for lNS?

182
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,126
Don't be stupid. We're in Mexico.
You're the illegal one here.

183
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:56,166
It doesn't mean he ain't got family up north
trying to clean their way to a green card.

184
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,166
He knows what I'm talking about.

185
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,900
Oh, you are too good to me, Suzy-Q.

186
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,712
Just how I like it.

187
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,153
How did I get so lucky?

188
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,382
Oh, no, Teddy Bear. I'm the lucky one.

189
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,594
The day I met you...

190
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:04,827
...was the day I was born.

191
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,873
-We're out of time.
-No, Susan.

192
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,274
We got our whole lives together.

193
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,074
No, I mean the hour is up.

194
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,183
I'll take care of you plenty, okay?

195
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,218
It's just, we're rolling here,
so let's, you know, get back.

196
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,583
How's the-- What's cooking,
good-looking?

197
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,021
I would really feel better
if you paid me up-front.

198
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:31,993
I told you up-front that if you did this right,
I would take care of you, so....

199
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,831
You paid me for an hour.

200
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,363
The hour's up.

201
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,300
If you want me to stay,
I need more money.

202
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,770
Great. Great, you ruined it. Thanks.

203
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:49,044
You know, for a second, I was like,
"This chick has a brain in her head."

204
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,308
Then, if you did,
you wouldn't be a street whore, right?

205
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,120
You know, I don't know
who this Suzy-Q bitch is...

206
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,553
...but no wonder she wants nothing
to do with you.

207
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,696
You didn't just call her a bitch, did you?

208
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,364
Okay.

209
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,592
I'm going to count to three.

210
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:13,226
And if you don't put your arm down,
I'm going to scream.

211
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,670
One.

212
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,207
Two--

213
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,070
We made it.

214
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,908
Not yet.

215
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,276
First, there's someone we need to see.

216
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,276
Okay, who's got what?

217
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,389
Christ as a rose. It's a common theme
that runs through the Bible.

218
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,457
Martin Luther adopted it,
his coat of arms.

219
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,924
And there's a belief
that Christ rose from the dead.

220
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:14,532
And since this is Scofield's final step,
a new life, could be something there.

221
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,260
You, keep track of this on the board.
On the board.

222
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,629
-Where's Wheeler?
-Here we go.

223
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,104
Harmonists. First settlers
of New Harmony, lndiana.

224
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,470
Used a golden rose
as their symbol for Christ.

225
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,613
-That's a reach.
-There's a flower called the Christmas rose.

226
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,612
Wasn't Christ Rose
the German code name...

227
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,412
...for the counterattack by the Nazis
that led to the Battle of the Bulge?

228
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,848
Where was that?

229
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,546
Ardennes Forest.
On the Belgium-Germany border.

230
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,189
Not a bad place to hide,
if they can find it.

231
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,658
So you gonna look into that?

232
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,490
-Yeah.
-All right, what else?

233
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,859
Christ potentially rose
from the dead on Easter.

234
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,194
-Easter Sunday?
-Easter Seals?

235
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,009
Who's got Scofield's file?

236
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,271
Here we go.

237
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,555
Christ in a rose.

238
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,925
-Yeah, what about it?
-Scofield's mother's name.

239
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,259
"Christina Rose" Scofield.

240
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,834
But I thought she was dead.

241
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,762
Well, so did l.

242
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,832
So did l.

243
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,448
First thing that Scofield did
when they broke out of Fox River...

244
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,017
...is pick up supplies
that he had stashed in a grave.

245
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,984
I want you to find out
where Scofield's mother's buried.

246
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,987
And what?

247
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,025
-And see if she's buried.
-Yes, sir.

248
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,889
-What about Panama?
-What about Panama?

249
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:55,022
We found his hard drive. It was full of
information about Panama in particular.

250
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,668
Which he knows you have.
Guy's got all kinds of hubris.

251
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:01,465
But he's smart enough to stay out of
a country where he knows you'll be waiting.

252
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,006
Unless there's something there
that he needs.

253
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,837
Or someone.

254
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,773
I want a map of Panama.

255
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,915
And find out if Scofield's mom,
Christina Rose...

256
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:15,349
...has any family in Central America,
any property, anything.

257
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,934
Last time I was in a bus like this
I was heading to Fox River.

258
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,967
Man, this country's amazing.

259
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,934
It's beautiful.

260
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:38,572
-What's that smell, man?
-Bananas and sugar cane.

261
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,507
It's Panama's biggest exports.

262
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,907
Come on, man.

263
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,516
You've been talking about Panama and
bumpy bus rides ever since we broke out.

264
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,710
-And now we're actually doing it--
-She should've been here with us.

265
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,020
We got all the time in the world for that.

266
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,524
-Someplace down the track, you and Sara--
-Can we just get there, please?

267
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,423
Sure.

268
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,692
So far, no hits on any connection
between Scofield's mother and Panama.

269
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,964
But there are 38 listings of Christina Rose
in various combinations...

270
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,074
...of first name, middle name
and last name.

271
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,473
All right, cross-reference the names
with the number 61 7 from the tattoo.

272
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,637
Maybe it's not a date.
See if it's an address.

273
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,748
-Got it.
-lf anybody pops, call the embassy.

274
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,113
Have them send an officer
to pick up the woman for questioning.

275
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,483
I don't think we can just arrest
a foreign citizen without--

276
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:35,650
Patriot Act. I could arrest your grandmother
for missing a stitch in her macramé.

277
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,058
If anybody's helping Scofield, dead or alive,
I wanna know who they are.

278
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,340
That her?

279
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,998
Yeah.

280
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,180
Hola, Mrs. Vasquez.

281
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,287
You are late. It's much later
than the date you said.

282
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,219
Well, we ran into a little bit of trouble.

283
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,858
Who is this?

284
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,761
It's a business associate.

285
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:15,090
Christina Rose. I remember.

286
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,734
You will find her here.

287
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,940
I'll meet you outside.

288
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,942
I forgot to ask something.

289
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,341
All right.

290
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,544
Do you have a phone I could use?

291
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,290
Yes, I need an international operator,
please.

292
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,592
United States.

293
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:53,033
It's 31 2-346--

294
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,105
-What are you doing?
-Making a phone call.

295
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,968
You can't.

296
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,666
We don't even know if she's alive.

297
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,904
If Sara's in custody, they got her phone.

298
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,143
You wanna get caught?

299
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,760
-Yeah?
-Three things I hate, Alex.

300
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:28,235
Traffic, hockey, and calling you
with the same question over and over.

301
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,467
Then don't call me anymore.
But I believe the brothers are in Panama.

302
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,737
-Is that so?
-The key to where is on Scofield's tattoos.

303
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,212
While I'm thrilled
you've narrowed it down to a country...

304
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,248
...that's not why we're talking.

305
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,284
Benjamin Miles Franklin is alive.

306
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,853
I'm aware of that, yeah.

307
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,820
And being released from custody.

308
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,517
Not possible.
They would need permission from my office.

309
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,525
Good to know you're on top of things.

310
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,497
Find me Agent Wheeler.

311
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,874
He'll see you now.

312
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:24,821
Forgive me for asking, sir,
but couldn't we be doing this in my office?

313
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,055
It'd be much more comfortable.

314
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,298
I felt we needed to speak freely.

315
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,165
For the next several hours,
this is what those...

316
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,299
...in the intelligence community refer to
as a blind spot.

317
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,005
Something to do with the position
of the sun, I'm told.

318
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,979
Disrupts long-distance recording devices.

319
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,220
If I may apologize again, sir...

320
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,323
...for the unfortunate outcome
with the president.

321
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,121
I know how important she was to our
interests. I assure you that moving forward--

322
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,889
You won't be moving anywhere
until you can explain to me...

323
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,794
...how this happened.

324
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,532
The brothers.

325
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,540
-They're making it--
-Still alive?

326
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,842
Yes. It appears they were able
to flee the country.

327
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,505
To where?

328
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,708
Mr. Mahone seems to believe
they're in Panama.

329
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:33,593
Does our Mr. Mahone know
where exactly in Panama they are?

330
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,791
Not yet. Why?

331
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,301
How much do you know
about Sona, Mr. Kim?

332
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,235
Only what I've been given clearance on.

333
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:48,768
Perhaps what our situation requires
is a change in strategy.

334
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,517
How long till the court
approves the arrest warrant?

335
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,282
Any time now. Just waiting
for the indictment to come down.

336
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,254
Okay. Well, I've got a question for you.

337
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,951
What if he's in there?
I can't keep avoiding him.

338
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,495
He reads people. That's what he does.

339
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,429
If he finds out I'm involved,
I'm gonna need protection from--

340
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,764
Wheeler, relax. Take a breath.

341
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:16,601
The only thing Mahone can read is what
you write for him. Can you act normal?

342
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:17,935
That's all you have to do.

343
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,304
We don 't want him to get spooked
and take off.

344
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,843
This is all gonna be over soon.

345
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,140
All right. Thank you.

346
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,181
No. Thank you.

347
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,624
Wheeler.

348
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,989
Where you been?

349
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,800
I gotta do this.

350
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,010
What are you doing, Alex?
I'm not wearing a wire.

351
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,479
-You gonna tell me what's going on here?
-ln Old England...

352
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,677
...the punishment for a traitorous act
was beheading.

353
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,887
Following the execution, they would
hold up the severed head by the hair.

354
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,289
Not for the crowd to see the head,
but for the head to see the crowd...

355
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,125
...because consciousness sticks around
for another eight seconds.

356
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,200
Idea was that it would give the
traitor one more chance to take--

357
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,133
You don't wanna do this, okay?
Just take a moment--

358
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,399
If you're gonna stab me in the back,
Agent Wheeler...

359
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,406
...be smart enough
to cover up the knife.

360
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,704
You go and visit Franklin
three times this week.

361
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,847
Called Sullins, what, twice a day?

362
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,074
Didn't you learn anything
working for me?

363
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,617
You gotta cover your tracks,
unless you....

364
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,021
Unless you wanna get caught.

365
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,597
You wanted me to know it was you.

366
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,662
-You're a killer, Alex.
-ls that so?

367
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,899
Soil samples from your yard in connection
with the disappearance of Oscar Shales.

368
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,807
Forensics is prepared to submit a report
detailing the irregularities...

369
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,210
...in the shooting
of David "Tweener" Apolskis.

370
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,749
There's your blatant disregard
for protocol in the death of John Abruzzi--

371
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,218
And the escaped con who says
that I told him to kill himself, I know.

372
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:16,292
You think his testimony is gonna send you
to the Promised Land?

373
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,355
You can erase me too.

374
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,524
But it's not gonna erase
the very real fact...

375
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,796
...that you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in prison.

376
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,201
You know....

377
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,477
You remind me of myself
when I was a young agent.

378
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,381
What?

379
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,584
I wish I could take that as a compliment.

380
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,122
That's some real fine work, Wheeler.

381
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,985
Good job, though.

382
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:52,955
Don't you let anyone scare you
into doing the wrong thing.

383
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:58,997
Let me take you in.

384
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,304
Whatever mess you're in,
we can clean it up.

385
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,101
There's only one way to clean this.
One way.

386
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,447
Hey, you got a visitor.

387
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,746
-Yeah, who?
-I don't know.

388
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,479
I was just instructed to bring you.

389
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:22,422
Hey, look, I ain't going nowhere until
you tell me who it is I'm meeting, all right?

390
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,859
You guys, just stop it.
Listen to me for a second.

391
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,861
That's all you gotta do,
go out and check.

392
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,523
Look, the guy's kind of tall, okay?

393
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,933
It's the least that you can do, huh?

394
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,338
-What the...?
-Daddy.

395
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,774
Oh, my God.

396
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,971
Come here.

397
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,148
Daddy loves you so much.

398
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,856
So is it real?

399
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:06,329
He says you're gonna go free,
that we don't have to run anymore.

400
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,632
-I mean, what happened? What changed?
-Hey, hey, hey.

401
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,139
Now, don't you worry about it.

402
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,402
You just know that your man
handles things.

403
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,342
Ain't that right? That's right.

404
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:20,946
Okay. I don't believe it, but okay.

405
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,384
Benjamin, if I could just have
a quick word.

406
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,018
Yeah. Hey....

407
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,596
Why don't you go down the hall
for just a quick second, okay?

408
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,391
-I'll be right there.
-Okay.

409
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,934
Here it is.

410
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,971
New address, new identities.

411
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,838
The prosecutor's gonna be in touch
to go over your testimony.

412
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,674
So you just make sure you show up
where he says and when he says.

413
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,544
Yeah, okay, okay.

414
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,947
But I'm a free man, right?

415
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,283
Free man.

416
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,194
Oh, wait a minute.
What about Mahone, you know?

417
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,353
I don't wanna be looking
over my shoulder for the rest of my life.

418
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,864
You let me worry about Mahone.
You just worry about staying out of trouble.

419
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,901
Hey, you ain't gonna have a problem
with that. Trust me.

420
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,005
Don't screw it up.

421
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,727
How much further?

422
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,591
Not far.

423
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:43,964
You know, for what it's worth,
no one forced Sara to do what she did.

424
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,065
Whatever gets you through the night.

425
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,832
What the hell does that mean?
I didn't ask you to use her.

426
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,441
It's not that simple.

427
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:55,477
-Whatever gets you through the night.
-You know what amazes me, Linc?

428
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,642
Nothing ever registers with you. Ever.

429
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,011
It just rolls right off your back,
doesn't it?

430
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,977
We ruin Sara's life
and it's like you don't even care.

431
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,124
-ls that what you think?
-We're here, and Sara's back in prison.

432
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,089
-Does that seem fair?
-None of it's fair.

433
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,093
-Don't make this about boy loses girl.
-Who should it be about?

434
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,094
Westmoreland? Tweener?

435
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,755
-L.J.?
-Let me stop you there.

436
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,165
Remember the name of the guard murdered
because of the riot I started?

437
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,168
-Shut up.
-Do you even remember his name?

438
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,967
-Shut up.
-Bet you remember Veronica's, don't you?

439
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,736
-Mention her name again, I swear to God!
-What about T-Bag?

440
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,469
He's out there now because of us.

441
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,170
You and me.

442
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:39,081
Every life he takes,
that's blood on our hands.

443
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,952
And for what?

444
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,589
I didn't ask you to do what you did.

445
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,898
They were gonna kill you, Linc.

446
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,693
Well, maybe you should've let them.

447
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,363
Take that back.

448
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:23,164
As bad as I feel about Sara,
she had a choice.

449
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,203
Veronica didn't.

450
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,203
I listened to her die, Michael.

451
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,669
I listened to her die,
and there was nothing I could do.

452
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,107
Nothing.

453
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,921
We've lost so much, man.

454
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,583
We can't afford to lose each other.

455
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,661
We just can't.

456
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,687
Going somewhere, Alex?

457
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,826
I don't know. Am l?

458
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:27,023
Come on. You know I don't like
to get my hands dirty.

459
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,971
It's surprising the things a man will do
when properly motivated.

460
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,612
Wasn't it you who told me that?

461
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,310
You know, I would kill you right now...

462
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,917
...if I thought it would give me
an ounce of peace.

463
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,915
And what would give you peace?

464
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:57,125
I've been able to hold it together
through all this...

465
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,658
...because there was a light
at the end of the tunnel.

466
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:06,498
A life at the end of the tunnel
for me, for my family.

467
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,263
And now what?

468
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:12,239
Do you see my son?
Do you see my wife?

469
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,268
What have I got?
What have you given me?

470
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,279
What if I was to tell you...

471
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:24,311
...that there was something
that could turn that light back on?

472
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,717
What would you say?

473
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,950
I'd say that's the same offer you made
when you dragged me into this.

474
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,757
And look where it's got me now.
They're gonna drag me before the public.

475
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,058
They're gonna prosecute me
like some kind of murderer.

476
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:40,796
There's evidence, really hard,
tangible evidence that you can't take away.

477
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,899
You're right.

478
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,074
But I can help you get away.

479
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,740
And at this point,
I don't think you've got any other options.

480
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,421
Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell
was apprehended in Mexico.

481
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,181
Oh, let me guess, you want him dead.

482
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,757
Oh, no.

483
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,596
There's been a change in strategy.

484
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,061
We're gonna need him alive.

485
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,567
I'm talking about
a very real finish line here, Alex.

486
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,205
You've come so far.

487
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,102
How much further would I have to go?

488
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,301
Well, you're lucky.

489
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,010
For this, you only have to go to Panama.

490
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,818
I'm trying to remember the last time
our lives made any kind of sense.

491
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,858
Before Mom died,
when it was just the three of us.

492
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,363
Well, there she is.

493
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,706
Hello, Lang.

494
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,111
What's going on? I mean, there's suits here
going through your office.

495
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,910
I'll explain later.

496
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,382
All right.

497
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,690
-Did you get the fax?
-No, why?

498
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,085
What do you got?

499
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,784
Information on Christina Rose
you might find interesting.

500
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,260
Looks like she was commissioned
about four months...

501
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,800
...before Scofield robbed that bank by a
builder in Panama named Amparo Vasquez.

502
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,664
Son of a bitch.

503
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,709
She's beautiful.

504
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,009
Yeah, she's not the real thing, but....

505
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,709
So where to, man?

506
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,979
Anywhere we want.

507
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,826
So is it really over?

508
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,865
Yeah. Yeah, baby, it's really over.

509
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,662
Okay.

510
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,646
What is it, baby?

511
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,586
Nothing.

512
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,922
Let's go home.

513
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:33,773
Okay, so we checked the train station
in Malinalco, the bus depot in Puebla...

514
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,311
...and just about every hotel there is.

515
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:41,181
Hello.
Hey, hey, hey, slow down, Sancho.

516
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,615
For you.

517
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,200
That was the guy from the tourism bureau.
He found him.

518
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,665
Where?

519
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,203
An E. Stammel just boarded a plane
to Panama City.

520
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,466
What the hell's he doing in Panama?

521
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,634
Speak English?

522
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,264
Say, "Good morning, Teddy."

523
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,300
Good morning, Teddy.

524
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,965
So then actually, no,
you don't speak English.

525
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,643
Habla any inglés around here?

526
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,720
Say, "Good morning, Teddy."

527
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,790
Good morning, Teddy.

528
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,894
Say, "Good morning, Teddy Bear."

529
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,628
Good morning, Teddy Bear.

530
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,791
You like wigs?

531
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,961
For the right money, I like anything.

532
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,375
There's nothing.

533
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,671
Nothing online about Sara's arrest.

534
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,211
Maybe they're keeping it quiet.

535
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,214
What about the message board?
The Gold Finch thing.

536
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:58,551
Just something from C-Note,
and there is a message from Sucre.

537
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,747
Still running, huh?

538
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,493
What?

539
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:11,394
Sucre says T-Bag's here, in Panama.

540
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,230
How the hell did he know?

541
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,895
I don't know.
He says, "The Bag still has the bag.

542
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,667
He's in Panama City
at the Fin Del Camino Hotel.

543
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:22,973
If you're there and want to help put that
bird back in the cage, let me know. Sucre."

544
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,308
What is that son of a bitch doing
in Panama?

545
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,246
-We gotta go after him.
-Just let it be.

546
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,978
-We don't need the money.
-It's not about the money, Linc.

547
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,920
Whatever good we do from here on out
doesn't matter as long as T-Bag's out there.

548
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:37,322
-Michael, we made it. All we--
-Much has gone wrong. If we could just....

549
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,192
if we could just make this right.

550
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,228
Panama City is only an hour away.
And now we know where he's staying.

551
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,130
Call the police.

552
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,238
There's a reason I chose Panama.
There's no extradition laws.

553
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:50,930
They're not gonna touch him.

554
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,973
So, what are you gonna do?

555
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,075
I'll figure something out.

556
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:58,579
Figure it out? You don't take a piss
without a plan, man. Come on.

557
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,774
Look, I never think,
and look where it got me.

558
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,816
Yeah, in Panama
with a boatload of booze.

559
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,114
You got me that.
I got me a death sentence.

560
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:10,283
Look, let's just get out to sea,
think things through.

561
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,986
When the time's right, we make it right.

562
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,889
Okay?

563
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,648
Trans-Panamanian Airlines flight 27 1
to Panama...

564
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,314
...now boarding
all first-class passengers.

565
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:45,690
Again, we're boarding for Panama City.

566
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,763
See you soon.

567
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,231
Home, sweet home.

568
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,670
I got the booze, but the limes are shot.

569
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,975
Michael?

570
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,479
Michael!

571
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,083
Michael.

572
