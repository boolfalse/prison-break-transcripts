1
00:00:01,087 --> 00:00:02,384
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:05,191
-The ranch is gone, Michael.
-We gotta do something.

3
00:00:05,247 --> 00:00:08,375
-It's not gonna involve hurting anyone.
-I got an idea.

4
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:11,536
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?

5
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,244
Those cons are in one of these towns.

6
00:00:13,343 --> 00:00:16,278
They couldn't have gone further
than 64 miles in any direction.

7
00:00:16,319 --> 00:00:17,980
I want everything in that perimeter.

8
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:22,559
You know, to be honest,
I was expecting to brief the president.

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,787
You report to me now.

10
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:26,559
Frankly, the biggest issue
we have to address...

11
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:28,454
...are the charges facing your daughter.

12
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:30,133
PIeasure to meet you, sir.

13
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:34,115
Sara, did you remember that guy
that I met with you in your apartment?

14
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,925
I want you to stay away from him.

15
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:38,932
-What are you talking about?
-I found out some other things too.

16
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:42,601
-Where is that?
-Oh, it' s Holland.

17
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:44,122
It's beautiful.

18
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,346
Gas up the car. And we'II meet you
right back here in an hour.

19
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:48,983
Okay.

20
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:51,521
Put your hands behind your head
and drop to your knees.

21
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:58,091
-Oh, God.
-Don't say a word, you old whore.

22
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:00,602
Or I'm gonna cut your throat out.

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,760
You try that again, I'II pry those vocal cords
right out of your throat.

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,150
She's coming up.

25
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:14,708
What's she doing?

26
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:17,368
She's coming up here.

27
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:21,446
Stay there, stay there.

28
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:35,518
Hey, Mom, you home?

29
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,944
Stay here. Stay quiet.

30
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:52,826
Mom?

31
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:42,179
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Back away and put your hands up.

32
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,706
-Just go easy.
-Go nothing.

33
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:45,899
She ain't the one carrying the cards here.

34
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:48,239
Back away and put your hands up.

35
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,755
I put my hand up,
I'm gonna take her jugular with it.

36
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:54,300
I don't want anyone
to do anything stupid, okay?

37
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,710
Don't move.

38
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,878
Let's be civil.

39
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:05,248
Stop, relax. Here you go.

40
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:08,043
Guy at the garden center said Burrows
was strong as a gorilla.

41
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:09,119
TOOELE, UTAH
TOOELE POLICE DEPARTMENT

42
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:12,216
-It was 1 p.m. when they tangled it up.
-The guy ID'd both of them.

43
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:14,381
Scofield, Burrows.
No doubt about it in his mind.

44
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:17,057
That was 1 p.m., they could be
300 miles from here by now.

45
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:20,247
You have picks, shovels and power tools
missing from that store.

46
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:21,810
They're here and they're digging.

47
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,945
Five million dollars buried somewhere
beneath the streets of Tooele.

48
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,049
-You really believe that?
-They believe that.

49
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:28,602
And that's the important thing.

50
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:32,639
They could be anywhere now.
We don't have the units to go door to door.

51
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,766
And we won't need them.

52
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:37,921
He's gonna tell us where to Iook.

53
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:48,746
Season 2
Episode 7
Buried

54
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:21,546
It's so funny,
I was just about to text you.

55
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,564
-Today's your Iucky day.
-Is it?

56
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:29,535
Yeah, my Aunt Maxine finally gave me
her famous chocolate-chip-cookie recipe.

57
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:33,562
And if you're free tonight,
I'd Iove for you to be my guinea pig.

58
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,535
I can't. Not tonight.

59
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:39,346
Come on. You sound just Iike Daniel,
"Not tonight. Not tonight."

60
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:42,260
You know what? If you don't mind,
I've actually gotta go.

61
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:46,570
Are you okay?
I mean, your cart's empty....

62
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,978
I'm good. Yeah, I just gotta go.

63
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:50,714
Sara....

64
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:08,850
-This is going wrong in every possible way.
-This is stupid, man. We cannot do this.

65
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:10,660
Hat's over the wall now.

66
00:05:10,975 --> 00:05:13,205
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

67
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:16,108
I mean we committed.

68
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,522
It's time to go get the hat.

69
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,751
-We don't have a choice.
-Yeah, we do.

70
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:22,925
We can walk right up
out of here right now, man.

71
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:24,497
And then what?

72
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,525
We are already in the house.

73
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,450
Those women are bound.
We have already committed this crime.

74
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,874
We Ieave, it ain't gonna change
any of that.

75
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:40,389
Why couldn't there just be a silo
in the middle of a field with no one around?

76
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,113
We'II figure it out
and get the money another way.

77
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,852
Yeah, maybe I can rob another bank.

78
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:50,107
You know what Charles once said to me?

79
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,745
He said there's no such thing
as an ex-con.

80
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:59,557
Because I used to think there was a way
we could wipe the slate clean.

81
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,800
Make up for everything we've done.

82
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:07,681
The hat's over the wall, Linc.

83
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,395
For everyone.

84
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,740
Sorry isn't gonna mean anything
to you right now.

85
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,043
But I wanna say it anyway.

86
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,591
This wasn't supposed to happen.

87
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:35,051
One or two hours, tops,
and we'II be out of here.

88
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,938
You have my word, no one will harm you.

89
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:44,065
Keep your eyes open, okay?

90
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,865
Nothing happens to them.

91
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:48,723
Nothing.

92
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,112
The doctor is suspicious.

93
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:06,627
She should be. She was on the Iine
with the governor when you walked up.

94
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:07,951
You were Iistening.

95
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:10,530
Both lines are tapped. We're not rookies.

96
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,457
Did her father tell her what he found?

97
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:15,562
Not over the phone.

98
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:17,424
But he knows who you are.

99
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:20,334
And so does she.

100
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,950
Seeing how she was supposed to Iead you
to Scofield and Burrows...

101
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:26,490
-...we're back to square one.
-Not necessarily.

102
00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:28,992
-There are other people they care about.
-The kid.

103
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,857
L.J.

104
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:36,543
-Now, in terms of the governor, Bill--
-The Burrows kid, Paul.

105
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:38,010
Focus.

106
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:48,901
Governor Tancredi's office, please hold.

107
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,928
-Governor Tancredi's office. Hold, please.
-Is my father in, Chris?

108
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:53,365
-Just a second.
-Okay.

109
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:55,268
-Governor Tancredi's office.
-Hey, Bruce.

110
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:57,083
-Oh, hi, Sara.
-I'm trying to get Dad.

111
00:07:57,182 --> 00:07:59,377
-I need to reach him on his cell.
-He just Ianded.

112
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:00,682
-Should be home soon.
-Okay.

113
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:03,734
-Don't know if he'II be in a talking mood.
-Why?

114
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,967
Your father got a call from the White House.
They withdrew his nomination.

115
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:11,368
What? I talked to him two hours ago.
He didn't say anything about that.

116
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,520
It just happened. According to them,
his confirmation was going to be a problem.

117
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:19,664
-We had the votes, right?
-Supermajority.

118
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:23,848
Okay, so President Reynolds
pulled the plug on a sure thing...

119
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,236
...in order to start over from scratch?

120
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:29,067
How often does something Iike that
happen in politics?

121
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,066
Never.

122
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:39,799
Since when did we become kidnappers?
It ain't right.

123
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,595
Well, we can buy a conscience
tomorrow.

124
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:47,175
Yeah, well, yeah, closing your eyes
ain't gonna make it go away.

125
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,417
I'II take five minutes
of a situation I can control...

126
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,434
...over 50 years of one I can't, any day.

127
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:57,286
Hey, Mr. Hundred Dollar Bill.

128
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,426
What's it Iike being
with the African persuasion, anyhow, huh?

129
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,893
-Yo, shut the hell up.
-Oh, hit me a nerve.

130
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:11,273
-Why don't you get in that hole and dig?
-How about you backing up, dark fella?

131
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:14,127
You're a Iong way away from home,
Trailer Park.

132
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,049
I can put you in that hole.

133
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:18,922
-And nobody would ever hear you scream.
-Knock it off.

134
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:21,033
We have security expert
Mark Bruni with us...

135
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:23,780
...who will explain how other prisons
are ensuring...

136
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:27,330
... that they are not victimized
by the next Fox River Eight.

137
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:33,022
Should be the Fox River Seven
now that Abruzzi's taken his dirt nap.

138
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:35,013
God rest the man's soul, of course.

139
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:38,451
Speaking of numbers, we're short one.

140
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,793
Kid's taking a Iong time
to fill that gas tank up.

141
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:53,244
I Ieaned on him
in every way I can think of.

142
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:55,336
He's not talking.

143
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,963
Are you Catholic?

144
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:16,582
Are you Catholic?

145
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:24,487
Not much good in it. A Iot of guilt.

146
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,558
But the one good thing is confession.

147
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:36,144
Whatever you got eating at you,
you just give it up.

148
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,105
Feels good, I have to say.

149
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:42,481
Guess it's Ietting it out.

150
00:10:43,422 --> 00:10:47,381
-Letting another human being hear--
-I got nothing to say to you, man.

151
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:55,488
What if I told you something?

152
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:59,394
A secret nobody else knows.

153
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,129
Oscar Shales.

154
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:12,697
A guy I was chasing a few years back.

155
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:15,090
Smart as hell.

156
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:19,259
I kept just missing him.

157
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,994
It became kind of a game, Iike chess.

158
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:25,930
Would've been fun
if it weren't for the fact...

159
00:11:26,014 --> 00:11:28,915
...that he were killing people
all along the way.

160
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:38,010
Bodies kept stacking up, and I started
to feel that it was because of me.

161
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:40,540
Because I couldn't do my job.

162
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:43,370
Because I wasn't smart enough.

163
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,055
Never did catch him.

164
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,168
But I did Iose it.

165
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:57,882
Saw things when I would drive at night.

166
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,349
Bodies.

167
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:02,403
Nightmares to the point
that I couldn't sleep.

168
00:12:06,014 --> 00:12:08,676
It was a complete break from reality.

169
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:13,416
That's what these Iittle guys are for.

170
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,631
Keep me in the game.

171
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,390
So now you know.
Now it's off my chest.

172
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:26,733
Ought to try it sometime.

173
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,370
Like I said before...

174
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:44,530
...I ain't gonna tell you nothing.

175
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,004
You know where those guys are.

176
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:51,947
If you're Iooking for a rat,
you've got the wrong guy, man.

177
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:54,799
No, I'm just trying
to spare you some guilt.

178
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:04,197
Bagwell was free Iess than 24 hours
before he killed his first victim.

179
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,873
If you don't tell me where he is now,
he's gonna kill again.

180
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,815
And that blood is gonna be
on your conscience and nobody else's.

181
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:23,685
Confession might not be
such a bad thing, huh?

182
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:32,849
He just arrived, L.J.

183
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,324
That's impossible.

184
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:37,696
I don't have a meeting scheduled
with my Iawyer.

185
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,361
He's a court-appointed public defender
in IIIinois.

186
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,796
I doubt he would come to Arizona
without calling me.

187
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:46,386
Let's go.

188
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,874
Yeah?

189
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,481
We're all set in Arizona
with the Burrows kid.

190
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:20,779
Good.

191
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,953
The kid's as good as gone.

192
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,431
What'd you say the name
of that Iawyer was?

193
00:14:31,518 --> 00:14:34,078
Didn't give it to me.
Gave it to the warden.

194
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:36,770
Then I want to talk to the warden.
Hey, you hear me?

195
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:38,492
After.

196
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:05,767
Hello, L.J.

197
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:09,209
-What do you want?
-They didn't tell you why I came here?

198
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:10,804
No.

199
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,401
I'm an ADA here in Mojave County.

200
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,495
I'm here to serve you with these.

201
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:18,105
What are those?

202
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:20,003
Your release papers.

203
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:39,431
-Hey. Is my dad in?
-Ms. Tancredi.

204
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,180
-In the study.
-Great, thank you.

205
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,698
Dad?

206
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:01,789
Help!

207
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:28,303
I need my pills.

208
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:31,471
PIease, I need my pills.

209
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:39,052
-What?
-I need my pills.

210
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:41,570
-Forget it.
-No, you don't understand. I need them.

211
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,293
They're for my baby.

212
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,890
They're Metformin,
to prevent a miscarriage. PIease.

213
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:51,259
They're in the drawer in the kitchen.

214
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:55,721
That one right there.

215
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:00,569
-How many?
-Two.

216
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,390
And water. PIease.

217
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:22,655
-Now I gotta put the gag back on.
-Wait.

218
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,241
Before you do,
I just have one more question.

219
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,278
You seem Iike a really good guy.

220
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,837
Why are you doing this?

221
00:17:33,342 --> 00:17:35,367
I'm not a good guy.

222
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:41,938
And these changes, do you really think
they'll help keep predators...

223
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:44,780
...Iike Theodore Bagwell
safely behind bars?

224
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,195
Without a doubt.

225
00:17:46,302 --> 00:17:49,863
Picture makes me Iook Iike a sociopath.

226
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:56,208
I'm not joking with you, Trailer Park.
Now, get in here and dig.

227
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:59,519
I am incapable, thanks to all y'all.

228
00:17:59,806 --> 00:18:03,708
Just remember, my X marked the spot!
You remember that.

229
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,905
We got a bigger issue. The kid.

230
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:09,247
-How Iong's it been since he Ieft?
-An hour and a half, maybe.

231
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:12,770
An hour and a half to fill a tank of gas?
That ain't right.

232
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,131
There has been a breaking development
in the double-homicide prosecution...

233
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:17,625
...of Lincoln Burrows, Jr.

234
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:20,286
Due to the sudden disappearance
of crucial blood....

235
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,477
Hey, Linc, I didn ' t know you had a boy.

236
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:26,080
--the Cook County District A ttorney's
Office had no choice...

237
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:30,442
...but to drop all charges
against the 1 6-year-old.

238
00:18:30,814 --> 00:18:32,509
Burrows is scheduled to be released...

239
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:35,268
...from the Klipton Detention Center
in Kingman, Arizona...

240
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:38,625
... where he 's currently being held,
tomorrow morning.

241
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:45,136
Keys to her car. Where are they?

242
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:46,508
-Here.
-Just hold on, okay?

243
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:49,501
-You can ' t do this, Linc.
-Why not?

244
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:54,129
-We are five minutes away in there.
-We've been five minutes for four hours.

245
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:57,600
-Just give me some time. Be patient.
-You think I give a damn about the money?

246
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,928
-I'm doing what's necessary.
-You're afraid to fail.

247
00:18:59,998 --> 00:19:01,829
You're afraid this plan ain't gonna work.

248
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:04,751
You wanna get caught proving
you can pull this off, be my guest.

249
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:06,732
L.J.'s out there. I'm gonna get him.

250
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:10,191
We have come 1 500 miles
across country.

251
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:13,173
We have made it this far.

252
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:18,724
Then I guess this is where we part ways.

253
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,822
-Any word on the interrogation?
-No, the kid's still stonewalling.

254
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,667
But we've got confirmation on Patoshik.

255
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:04,022
His prints were all over
that old Iady's house.

256
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:06,425
So he Ieaves the cash and the jewelry.

257
00:20:06,494 --> 00:20:09,725
The only thing he steals
is the $1 0 oil painting.

258
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:12,055
What the hell does he want with that?

259
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,369
Is there something I can help you with?

260
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,767
What? No.

261
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:41,085
You know, it'd be a Iittle easier
if you used a cart for all that stuff.

262
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:42,346
I'm just....

263
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:46,125
I wanted to see if it all fit in the bag.

264
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:50,488
What happened to your knee there?

265
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,387
Motorcycle accident.

266
00:20:52,478 --> 00:20:55,811
So you don't move around
too well then, do you?

267
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,361
Not really.

268
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,995
-Well, that's good.
-Hey, hey. Hey!

269
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:21,057
You can still come with me.

270
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:22,980
No, I could....

271
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,559
I could do this.

272
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,990
-And if you can't?
-Then we still meet up.

273
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,538
-Exactly where we planned.
-Bullshai Booze.

274
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:36,089
-Bolshoi.
-Bolshoi.

275
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:37,839
L.J.'s gonna be with me.

276
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:41,730
-You remember how to get there?
-How can I forget?

277
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,816
Thursday night, 6:00.

278
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,709
It's our Iast shot.

279
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:50,386
If we're....

280
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,877
If we do this right, we're gone forever.

281
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:59,367
A Iot of ground to cover in three days.

282
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:01,806
A Iot of ground.

283
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:04,334
AII right.

284
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:07,643
Take care.

285
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:10,961
They'II be gunning for you.

286
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:14,184
They'II get you any way they can, so....

287
00:22:14,974 --> 00:22:16,407
Yep.

288
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:22,726
Tell L.J.... Tell him I said there'II be
a surfboard with his name on it.

289
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:25,632
Nice. Bolshoi Booze.

290
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:27,286
-Three days.
-Three days.

291
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,084
Keep your head down.

292
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:00,234
Ms. Tancredi.

293
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:03,307
Hi...

294
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:05,866
...I just want to Iet you know
that the M.A...

295
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:08,679
...she's finished her preliminary
examination of the body.

296
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,669
She found no signs of foul play.

297
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:18,654
I know it's a shock, but we've also spoken
to the detail guard stationed outside.

298
00:23:18,654 --> 00:23:21,782
And he didn't see anyone, other
than your father, enter or exit...

299
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:24,052
...since he came back
from Washington.

300
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,252
My father's not a suicidal man.

301
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:33,043
Look, is there any extended family
I should call?

302
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:35,713
I'm an only child
and my mother passed away.

303
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:40,591
-Could I have a moment, please?
-Yeah.

304
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:13,529
That's a hell of a good deal, son.

305
00:24:14,238 --> 00:24:17,469
I mean, we're talking no additional time
on your sentence for the escape.

306
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:20,334
You want it in writing,
I'II put it in writing.

307
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:21,939
We will put you up at CIub Fed.

308
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:27,483
You'II spend your days playing racquetball
with stockbrokers and Iawyers.

309
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,404
Four years from now,
you'II be on the street.

310
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:33,588
Twenty-two years old,
with a clean slate...

311
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,461
...and your whole Iife ahead of you.

312
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:39,793
And no blood on your hands.

313
00:24:39,838 --> 00:24:41,567
Okay?

314
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:47,485
There's a woman in the house.

315
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,588
If you guys show up...

316
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:58,158
...they're just gonna turn her
into a hostage.

317
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:03,483
T-Bag, he ain't coming out alive.

318
00:25:03,486 --> 00:25:05,681
And he's gonna take her with him.

319
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:07,191
Let me worry about that.

320
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,939
No, hell, no.

321
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,262
The only way that
that woman comes out free...

322
00:25:14,302 --> 00:25:18,877
...is if someone shows up
on that porch that they trust.

323
00:25:18,877 --> 00:25:20,708
Being you.

324
00:25:22,973 --> 00:25:24,873
Being me.

325
00:25:33,277 --> 00:25:35,040
I'II take you to them.

326
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,728
Oh, you Iike....

327
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:43,414
You Iike jerky?

328
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:48,312
You Iike jerky.

329
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:55,716
What were you in for?

330
00:26:56,893 --> 00:26:58,224
I don't want to talk, Iady.

331
00:26:58,813 --> 00:27:01,213
I'm a prisoner in my own house.

332
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,543
The Ieast you could offer me
is a Iittle conversation.

333
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:08,188
AII right.

334
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:10,390
Just Iet me know when I hit it.

335
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:12,940
Murder. Rape.

336
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:16,149
Kidnapping. Sexual abuse.

337
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,852
-Child sexual abuse.
-Aggravated robbery.

338
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,904
-How Iong were you doing?
-Five years.

339
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,231
How much Ionger
did you have Ieft to serve?

340
00:27:26,301 --> 00:27:27,632
Eighteen months.

341
00:27:27,741 --> 00:27:30,209
Why on earth would you break
out of prison with--?

342
00:27:35,805 --> 00:27:37,705
What's her name?

343
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:40,432
Doesn't matter.

344
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:43,978
So, what? She was running away
with another man?

345
00:27:46,302 --> 00:27:49,135
-You should've Iet her go instead of--
-She's having my baby.

346
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:54,594
-How far along is she?
-I don't want to talk about it.

347
00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:58,149
I'm two months. I just had
my first-trimester sonogram on Tuesday.

348
00:27:58,174 --> 00:28:00,438
Ten-five. Dispatch to all units.

349
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:02,568
Has she shown you pictures of--?

350
00:28:02,653 --> 00:28:05,986
Transporting David Apolskis in FBI custody.
Stand by.

351
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:16,855
Yo, this is gonna take all day.
We need more manpower.

352
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:20,522
Standing around and jabbering
ain't gonna get the dirt out of that ground.

353
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:22,065
AII right, that's it.

354
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:25,281
You son of a bitch! Now what?

355
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:31,329
-We gotta roll.
-Why?

356
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:33,380
They got Tweener. It was on the radio.

357
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:37,844
Nice knowing y'all.

358
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:41,680
-They say anything about where we are?
-I'm not hanging around to find out.

359
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:47,543
Yo, maybe you should.

360
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,914
Maybe you should.

361
00:29:06,686 --> 00:29:09,314
Maybe we all should.

362
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:29,595
Let's go over this again.
None of them were armed?

363
00:29:29,661 --> 00:29:31,322
Guns? No.

364
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:34,754
Bagwell had a screwdriver or something.

365
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:37,910
-Do we really need this, man?
-Yeah.

366
00:29:37,949 --> 00:29:41,316
In case you decide to do something stupid,
Iike tip them off.

367
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:44,624
You don't have
a problem with that, do you?

368
00:29:46,877 --> 00:29:48,674
Compass, check.

369
00:29:48,765 --> 00:29:50,892
Map, check. Rope, check.

370
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:52,201
Okay.

371
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:59,625
I bet you're wondering what we're doing
down here by Lake Michigan, huh?

372
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:05,572
It's because if you go far enough that way,
you get to the ocean.

373
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:08,181
You know what's out there.

374
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,380
Holland.

375
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:19,189
We're gonna Iive in a windmill.

376
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:21,995
AII we need is a raft.

377
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,769
I'm gonna build it.

378
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:29,289
AII starts with this....

379
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:31,465
No, this stick.

380
00:30:37,213 --> 00:30:42,845
Charles Westmoreland, God bless you
and your wrinkled old sack.

381
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:44,800
It's all here.

382
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:47,054
I owe you a profound thanks, Pretty.

383
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,612
Couple of days from now...

384
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:53,092
...I'm gonna be walking the streets
of Bangkok with a million U.S.

385
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,950
That's about 40 million baht
in the Iocal currency.

386
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:58,625
What the hell is up with you
and Thailand, huh?

387
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:02,238
BIack-market surgery,
anonymous transplant donors.

388
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:05,363
Hes dressed Iike shes.
What's there not to Iike?

389
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:07,876
Are you really gonna try
to replace that hand?

390
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:10,160
Body ain't taking to this one.

391
00:31:15,421 --> 00:31:17,685
-Unbelievable.
-AII right, Iet's move.

392
00:31:18,173 --> 00:31:20,641
You know, that hand
ain't gonna be white.

393
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:22,970
-What?
-The new one.

394
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:26,698
Even if you get down there,
it ain't gonna be white.

395
00:31:27,358 --> 00:31:30,293
Hey, Johnny KKK over here's
gonna have an Asian hand.

396
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:49,390
No mistakes. Let's get them clean.

397
00:31:58,078 --> 00:32:00,672
I need to know if I can trust you.

398
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:02,194
They're escaping.

399
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:03,721
No, you can 't leave me here.

400
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,772
-Not like this.
-We had a deal, remember?

401
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:07,616
Now walk.

402
00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:56,552
-Scott.
-I don ' t got much time, all right?

403
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:58,833
I had to tell you something.

404
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,434
What you did for me
that day at the motel....

405
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:06,334
Ain't nobody in my Iife
that's been to bat for me Iike that.

406
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:10,138
-Get him. Go, go, go!
-And I Iied to you, okay?

407
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:13,272
My name ain't Scott.

408
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:15,170
-My name's Dave.
-Oh, my God.

409
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:17,252
-David Apolskis.
-Go now, go!

410
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:19,571
-Get away from the door!
-Get down. Now!

411
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:21,670
-Put your hands on your head!
-And I just....

412
00:33:21,757 --> 00:33:22,985
Put him in the car.

413
00:33:24,573 --> 00:33:27,371
I wanted you to know, all right,
I'm gonna be writing to you.

414
00:33:28,157 --> 00:33:30,625
And I sure as hell hope
that you write back.

415
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:33,208
AII clear!

416
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:51,508
Can I help you?

417
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,979
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

418
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:57,344
Contractor. Got some electrical issues.

419
00:33:57,725 --> 00:33:59,659
No, you can't help me.

420
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:01,072
Excuse me, is there a problem?

421
00:34:02,237 --> 00:34:04,296
-Ms. Owens?
-She's not home.

422
00:34:04,637 --> 00:34:07,071
Yeah, well, I'm supposed to drive her
to the club for--

423
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:08,430
She already went to the club.

424
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:12,868
Yeah, she came out,
said she was going to the club.

425
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:14,121
She got in her car and Ieft.

426
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:17,861
I don't know what else to tell you.

427
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:21,738
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

428
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:44,861
He's gone, but we gotta get out of here,
because once he gets to the club...

429
00:34:44,861 --> 00:34:48,490
...he's gonna find out she's not there
and he's gonna be back.

430
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:55,679
You know what? You were right.

431
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:58,767
It does feel good
to get stuff off your chest.

432
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:02,347
I'm sorry I had to play you Iike that, bro.

433
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:12,030
Yo, what's up?

434
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:16,464
Come on. It's gonna be a Iong drive.

435
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:17,838
Stretch your Iegs.

436
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:41,011
AII right.

437
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:59,453
Kellerman, I thought you were gonna deal
with the L.J. Burrows situation.

438
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:01,148
Oh, I did.

439
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:03,110
Then why is he being released
from custody?

440
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:05,961
In and of himself,
the kid is useless to us.

441
00:36:06,012 --> 00:36:09,573
His only value
is in who comes Iooking for him.

442
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,732
More importantly, Bill.

443
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,965
Governor Tancredi. Not part of our plan.

444
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:17,905
Last time I checked,
you Ieft no shortage of bodies in your wake.

445
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:21,612
No, I did what I had to do
to get Caroline where she is.

446
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:25,120
Now that she's there, Iet's not draw
any more attention than we have to.

447
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:27,492
You think getting to the top
is the hard part?

448
00:36:27,773 --> 00:36:30,833
She's a hundred times more visible.
Has a hundred times more enemies.

449
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:33,140
Anyone who knows anything
has got to be dealt with.

450
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:36,105
If someone is a Iiability, they go.

451
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:38,853
Tancredi was becoming a Iiability.

452
00:36:40,669 --> 00:36:42,466
So is his daughter.

453
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:44,404
Wait. What?

454
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:46,033
Sara?

455
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:49,641
Goodbye, Paul.

456
00:37:33,437 --> 00:37:34,995
You walk out with those guys now...

457
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:38,195
...it's only a matter of time
before you get caught. You realize that?

458
00:37:38,237 --> 00:37:40,171
You're not just dealing
with escape charges.

459
00:37:40,252 --> 00:37:42,243
Assault, unlawful imprisonment,
kidnapping--

460
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,062
-I don't need to hear this.
-No, you do.

461
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:47,615
How much Ionger do you really think
you can stay ahead of the cops?

462
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,198
Look, if you turn yourself in...

463
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:55,311
...I will testify at the sentencing,
I will say that you cooperated.

464
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,119
-That can make a difference.
-Shut up.

465
00:37:57,213 --> 00:37:58,441
Be smart.

466
00:37:58,557 --> 00:38:01,856
You have a baby on the way.
Wanna be around for its second birthday?

467
00:38:01,885 --> 00:38:03,443
-Or its 22nd?
-Shut up.

468
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:06,382
If you didn't wanna hear
what a big mistake you were making...

469
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:08,124
...you would've put that gag back on--

470
00:38:13,277 --> 00:38:16,212
Fernando! It's time to go!

471
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:20,633
You can still do the right thing,
Fernando.

472
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,385
Hey, Iooky here.

473
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:29,598
Looky here.

474
00:38:29,693 --> 00:38:33,561
Pocket change, in case you wanna
tip the valet when you're at the Ritz.

475
00:38:33,565 --> 00:38:36,363
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, boy.
Where's Sucre?

476
00:38:37,437 --> 00:38:38,734
Right here.

477
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:41,487
What are you doing?

478
00:38:41,597 --> 00:38:43,064
Drop the bag.

479
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:45,360
No one's going anywhere.

480
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:03,256
Hey, yo.

481
00:39:03,837 --> 00:39:07,204
Just so you know, man,
I'm not gonna roll on those guys.

482
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:10,892
It ain't gonna happen,
so if that's what this is about....

483
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:18,158
We were talking about confession earlier.

484
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:21,745
And....

485
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:27,741
I think I owe you an apology
because I Iied to you...

486
00:39:29,788 --> 00:39:31,278
...about Oscar Shales.

487
00:39:35,452 --> 00:39:38,319
Smart-ass just kept pushing it.

488
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,008
I snapped.

489
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,008
Right there.

490
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:47,352
That's where I put the bullet in him.

491
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:55,757
I don't care about none of this.

492
00:39:55,837 --> 00:40:00,001
Mistake about that is that forensics
will tell the whole tale.

493
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:04,313
Powder burns.
The gun was right against his head.

494
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,213
Sir....

495
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:11,293
-We should go back--
-That's what's good about confession.

496
00:40:11,357 --> 00:40:13,791
Because you say something,
you get it off your chest...

497
00:40:13,852 --> 00:40:16,377
...and it just goes out there
into the whole world.

498
00:40:16,445 --> 00:40:19,141
I'm so sorry about this, kid,
because I hope you understand.

499
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:21,893
-Yo, yo, hold on--
-I got nothing against you, kid.

500
00:40:23,677 --> 00:40:25,110
What are you doing, man?

501
00:40:25,853 --> 00:40:27,252
But they do.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
