1
00:00:01,183 --> 00:00:02,980
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:05,437
I need a number
for a Sundown Hotel, please.

3
00:00:05,503 --> 00:00:07,368
I got one in Gila, New Mexico.

4
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:11,658
NM, 6-3. Tomorrow.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,738
-Who is this?
-I think you already know.

6
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:17,486
If I buried someone in my own backyard,
I'd think about it all the time.

7
00:00:17,503 --> 00:00:21,887
Let me and my family disappear.
And in return, I'll keep your little secret.

8
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:23,855
It's not how you wanted this
to play out.

9
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:26,927
But sometimes things happen
that are just out of your control.

10
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:29,773
I'll see you soon, Michael.
It may be sooner than you think.

11
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:31,748
-You can ' t be here.
-Where's your sister?

12
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,830
-I need to see Maricruz.
-Wedding's at 2:30.

13
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:35,819
Maricruz, she told him no.

14
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,736
-Do you believe that?
-Go on. Get your girl.

15
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:46,324
L.J.

16
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:48,262
-Both of you, face down. Now!
-PIease.

17
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:53,533
Suspect in custody.
Possible ID, Lincoln Burrows.

18
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:04,159
Now, you're gonna tell me where
you stashed Westmoreland's money...

19
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,061
...or I'm gonna pluck you Iike a chicken,
stitch by stitch.

20
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:40,752
For a millionaire, you travel Iight.

21
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:45,328
Hey. Hey, what is this?

22
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:50,753
It's for my blood pressure.

23
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,002
Lookie what I found.

24
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,538
Guess Ms. Hollander
Iiked to beat some meat.

25
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:01,990
A couple whacks with this would help
you remember where you put the money.

26
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:05,246
Hey, we've been beating his ass all night.
He ain't coming off the goods.

27
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:07,179
We need to do something different.

28
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:11,551
It don't matter what you do to me.
I ain't talking.

29
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,611
Well, I ain't stopping
till I get what I came for.

30
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:18,112
-How about we Iisten to that again?
-PIease.

31
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:25,310
Tell me where that money is
or I'm gonna read it on your tombstone.

32
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:31,436
Okay, I will give you a Iittle clue.

33
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,434
It ain't here.

34
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:57,656
-Confirmed. Burrows is in custody.
-Yeah!

35
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:04,075
Unbelievable.
He made it all the way to Arizona.

36
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:06,391
Another day, he'd have been gone.

37
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:08,499
You find Mahone?

38
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:12,304
No. Keep trying to call,
it goes straight to voicemail.

39
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,914
This is Alexander Mahone.
Please leave a message.

40
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:24,305
-Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Kellerman.

41
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:28,219
-Lincoln Burrows is in custody.
-That's the reason I called.

42
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:30,486
-Who has him?
- Willcox, Arizona P.D.

43
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:32,740
We need to extricate him. Right away.

44
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:34,455
Where' s Mr. Mahone?

45
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:37,528
I ' m getting in touch with him now.
But I can take care of this one.

46
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:40,535
This is why we hired Mr. Mahone.

47
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:44,272
-He's the official face here.
-Don't worry, this won't be official.

48
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:47,084
-And there won't be any questions.
-Of course there will.

49
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:51,317
Just make sure
no one's Ieft to answer them.

50
00:04:03,038 --> 00:04:05,302
My son had nothing to do with this,
please.

51
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,400
A judge will decide that.

52
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:12,417
-Did you call in?
-Yeah. Phoenix is sending backup.

53
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,310
I don't think that's one of ours, Jimmy.

54
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,050
What the hell?

55
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:37,279
Hey!

56
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,714
Come on!

57
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,524
Move it! Run! Don't stop!

58
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,459
Come here.

59
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,408
-Let go of me.
-Okay, calm down. Calm down.

60
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:19,827
-You try that again--
-Who are you?

61
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,799
We're on your side.

62
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,278
We're with your father.

63
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:30,572
Mahone, Lincoln Burrows
has been apprehended.

64
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:31,954
-Where?
-Arizona.

65
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:34,428
I'm on my way, and I need your talents
on the ground.

66
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:36,689
I'II get there as soon as I can.

67
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:39,530
I don't think you heard me.
Get to Arizona.

68
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,574
I'm this close to Scofield.

69
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:43,459
Well, we have a bird in the hand.

70
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,712
Yeah, well, so might I.

71
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,124
You wanted me to figure out
Scofield's rendezvous with Tancredi?

72
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:54,996
It's happening today.

73
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,251
And I'm sitting right on top of it.

74
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:13,531
Season 2
Episode 10
Rendezvous

75
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,237
What are you Iooking at?

76
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:15,391
-Where are we?
-It doesn't matter.

77
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:18,913
You're safe here. You can take a seat.

78
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:21,468
I ain't doing a thing until I see my dad.

79
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,628
AII I can tell you is, he's on his way.
His flight Iands in an hour.

80
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:27,102
Why should I trust you, Iady?

81
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,583
I don't see you have much of a choice.

82
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:34,706
I could drop you off back with the cops
if you'd prefer.

83
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:42,183
-You have somewhere else to be?
-Matter of fact, we do.

84
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,536
Well, we can't Iet you Ieave.

85
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:46,047
Your father was expecting
your brother to be with you.

86
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:47,635
Do you know where he is?

87
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:49,574
Do you really think
I'm gonna answer that?

88
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:53,215
You need to start cooperating
with us, Lincoln.

89
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:55,884
We're only trying to help.

90
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:02,816
Michael Scofield.

91
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,377
He escaped from Fox River Penitentiary
a week ago.

92
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,865
Nope. Never seen him.

93
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:11,496
Well, if you do,
please call me at that number.

94
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,247
Will do.

95
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:15,072
There's another hotel down the road.

96
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,436
Thanks.

97
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:59,522
-Yeah?
-You got a fax.

98
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:02,334
Could you put it under the door, please?

99
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:07,164
Thank you.

100
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:19,879
Theresa. It's Fernando Sucre.

101
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,858
-Fernando.
-Theresa.

102
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,306
-She's not here.
-PIease don't hang up. I'm so sorry.

103
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,933
PIease, just--

104
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:28,505
I just need to know something.

105
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:30,905
You've got bigger problems
than my sister right now.

106
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:32,942
No, no, wait. PIease, please.

107
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:35,991
-I need to talk to her. PIease.
-You can't.

108
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,930
My-- We're Ieaving this afternoon.

109
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:39,812
-Where are you going?
-Ixtapa, Mexico.

110
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:41,529
We won 't be back for a week.

111
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,565
We're taking the honeymoon
she had planned with Hector.

112
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:47,040
She's picking me up in a few hours.

113
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:49,264
-What time?
-A Iittle before 2.

114
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,175
She's gonna have to call me, okay?
I'II give you the number.

115
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:54,884
-Where are you?
-Take this number of the caller ID.

116
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:56,740
Please, Theresa.

117
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,731
Just have her call me, okay?

118
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:01,833
I'II be right here.

119
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:46,723
Hello, Sara.

120
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:59,610
I wasn't sure you'd come.

121
00:14:00,478 --> 00:14:02,537
I didn't have a choice.

122
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:07,878
This isn't gonna be easy for you.

123
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:11,301
You said in your message
that you had a plan to make this right.

124
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:13,521
I need to know what that is.

125
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:27,473
Yeah. Yeah, she checked in Iast night.

126
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,417
-Was she alone?
-Yeah.

127
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:34,688
Kelli Foster. I put her in Room 9.

128
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,409
You the guy calling this morning?

129
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,207
-A guy tried to call this morning?
-Yeah, he was trying to send her a fax.

130
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:43,578
-Did he do it?
-Yeah, 20 minutes ago.

131
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:45,013
Does your fax have memory?

132
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,675
I guess so.

133
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:54,720
-Do you know where that is?
-It's five minutes away.

134
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:58,654
If she comes back,
is there anything you want me to do?

135
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:00,939
She isn't coming back.

136
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,004
I've arranged for us to get to Panama.

137
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:07,111
We're meeting up with my brother
tomorrow.

138
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,270
Wait, that's your plan?

139
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:18,186
To run away to Panama with
the two most wanted men in America?

140
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:24,383
I came here because I thought you
were gonna have real answers for me.

141
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:25,804
This is an answer.

142
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:31,083
And right now,
it's the only one we've got.

143
00:15:31,422 --> 00:15:36,126
Running away into the sunset
with the man who Iied to me?

144
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:39,459
Really? I mean, did you know
about the other guys?

145
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:42,512
Did you know that I would be putting
T-Bag back out onto the street?

146
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:44,958
I never meant for that to happen.

147
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:47,115
I was doing what I needed to do.

148
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,383
-My brother was gonna die.
-Now my father's dead.

149
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,634
I am sorry about your father.

150
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,448
I'm sorry for a Iot of things.
For what I did to you.

151
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:16,165
I have many...

152
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,763
...many regrets.

153
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:21,610
-But that's the biggest.
-That doesn't help me right now.

154
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:28,444
I'm sorry for that too.

155
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,966
I didn't expect you to....

156
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:36,731
I didn't expect you to forgive me.

157
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,578
But I don't want you to....

158
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:43,862
I don't want you to be alone in this.

159
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:57,398
I don't wanna be alone.

160
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:09,370
-Let's go. Get in the car.
-We can't get out this way.

161
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:12,969
-Michael, that's the only way out of here.
-Then that's the way we're going.

162
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:31,776
-Hold on. Just hold on.
-Michael, what are you doing?

163
00:17:31,838 --> 00:17:33,601
Just hold on.

164
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,990
Come on.

165
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,145
Michael!

166
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:09,158
-You all right?
-He's still behind us.

167
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:20,375
Hold on.

168
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:01,349
On your feet, Bagwell.

169
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,459
Skewer's hot.

170
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,826
He's got a key.

171
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:24,197
I'm gonna get that key if I have to....

172
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:32,699
Down.

173
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,867
We're gonna see that key again, friend.

174
00:19:45,054 --> 00:19:46,681
We're gonna see it real soon.

175
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:52,684
Give me my credit card.

176
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:55,317
What did you get me?

177
00:19:57,662 --> 00:19:58,924
What else you get?

178
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,374
Prune juice, smokes, a Iittle dip,
and a bag of sliders.

179
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:06,772
What do you want first?

180
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:10,553
Looks Iike a chew guy to me.

181
00:20:23,614 --> 00:20:27,106
-No spitting.
-He's had worse things in his mouth.

182
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:04,667
What do you want, Fernando?

183
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:07,159
From the future?

184
00:21:09,277 --> 00:21:11,768
Would you run if I said you?

185
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:15,646
Would you chase me if I did?

186
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,518
We gotta get back to my car.

187
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:36,716
It's too far.

188
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:38,919
If we go now,
before he gets more people....

189
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,440
He's not gonna call for backup.

190
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,362
-He wants his privacy.
-Why?

191
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,100
He's not trying to catch me.

192
00:21:51,198 --> 00:21:53,359
He's trying to kill me.

193
00:22:04,062 --> 00:22:05,859
Your grandfather...

194
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,151
...he was the reason I was set up
in the first place.

195
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:12,824
He used to work for the people
who wanted me dead.

196
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:16,414
This is all just to get to him.

197
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:19,018
Your father should be arriving
any minute now.

198
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:22,759
Jane, right?

199
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:26,068
Sorry.

200
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,629
Don't worry about it.

201
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:30,031
You know my dad?

202
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,361
Well?

203
00:22:33,822 --> 00:22:35,687
Well enough.

204
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:37,536
We used to work together.

205
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,818
The Company.

206
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,647
Yeah.

207
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:43,089
But that was a Iong time ago.

208
00:22:43,198 --> 00:22:45,758
And now I work against them,
just Iike he does.

209
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:49,258
I guess you walked out on your family too.
No explanations, no goodbyes.

210
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:50,938
I don't have a family.

211
00:22:51,422 --> 00:22:53,447
He really wants to see you
and your brother.

212
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:55,900
He hasn't seen Michael
since he was 1 0 years old.

213
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,490
They're here.

214
00:22:58,109 --> 00:22:59,508
Wait here.

215
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,485
-Let's go.
-Where are we going?

216
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,965
Michael never met your grandfather.

217
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:14,681
Hey!

218
00:23:24,094 --> 00:23:25,322
Dad.

219
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,701
I don't wanna get trapped in here.

220
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,001
There's gotta be an exit
on the other side.

221
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,032
-You go on.
-Michael.

222
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:36,302
I'II be right behind you. Go.

223
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,391
The news is not good. Burrows was
intercepted before I got here.

224
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:51,668
It is a setback,
but we're not that far behind.

225
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,642
Paul, Paul. Calm down.

226
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:57,210
It'II be all right.
Someone will take care of it.

227
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,109
Someone who?

228
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:02,099
Bill, tell me you're not bringing
someone else in on this.

229
00:25:02,142 --> 00:25:04,667
You didn't think
you were alone on this, did you?

230
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:08,169
You're a soldier. There's an army.

231
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:11,821
Tell me, what do you have
on Sara Tancredi?

232
00:25:11,998 --> 00:25:15,331
-What does that have to do with this?
-Go back to your original assignment.

233
00:25:15,357 --> 00:25:17,552
Bill, I'm here now. I can do this.

234
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:18,857
-And then--
-The girl.

235
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:21,698
We need to know
what her father told her.

236
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,920
When you find out, give me a call.

237
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:34,584
This is Agent Kellerman. I need that
rental car information on Sara Tancredi.

238
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,192
Yeah, this is it right here.

239
00:27:15,838 --> 00:27:20,318
Seventy-five foot, twin diesel Azimut...

240
00:27:20,318 --> 00:27:21,945
...fly bridge, panoramics.

241
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:24,037
Pull up in a boat Iike that,
you're somebody.

242
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,353
-Let me see.
-Hey, get off.

243
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:26,800
No.

244
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:38,334
How you doing, Bagwell?

245
00:27:42,141 --> 00:27:44,735
-Get the stool.
-What stool?

246
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,594
The stool.

247
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:57,075
It's from one of them Iockers
in a bus station.

248
00:27:57,757 --> 00:28:00,419
I'II try not to think about
where it's been.

249
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:12,480
-91 1 operator, what's your emergency?
-Don't do that. Come on.

250
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:15,339
Hey there, send the police.
Some scumbag broke into my house.

251
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:18,119
- Your address?
-Yeah, 1 605 Midberry Hill.

252
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:21,268
-Is he still there?
-Yeah, you better come quick.

253
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:24,440
-Let's hit it, Roy.
-Come on, now, please don't do this.

254
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:27,103
Don't Ieave me Iike this.
I can take you back to the money.

255
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:29,156
-I know right where it is.
-So do I.

256
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:32,152
I'm begging you, don't do this. PIease.

257
00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:34,701
Geary, we can make a deal.
I know what you want.

258
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:37,909
No deals. You just crapped out
your Iast bargaining chip, pal.

259
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,110
Wait, please!

260
00:29:25,693 --> 00:29:28,992
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, AIex.

261
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:31,081
You smell that?

262
00:29:31,165 --> 00:29:32,928
It's propane.

263
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,046
It's filling the room.

264
00:29:35,134 --> 00:29:39,594
And if you pull that trigger,
we both die.

265
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,194
No!

266
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:57,828
-I'II do it. I'II do it.
-Maybe.

267
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,954
But before you do...

268
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:02,394
...Iet me ask you a question, AIex.

269
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,294
Do you think
you're still one of the good guys...

270
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:07,000
...fighting the good fight?

271
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:09,535
Because I think we both know
you've crossed over.

272
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:12,123
You're on the wrong side
chasing the wrong guys.

273
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,673
My brother is innocent.

274
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,618
-He never killed anyone.
-Well, thanks for opening my eyes.

275
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:22,020
Okay, AIex, shoot.

276
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:25,169
-We both know what'II happen.
-The propane will kill me anyway.

277
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:27,613
What difference does it make?
Might as well do it now.

278
00:30:27,677 --> 00:30:29,702
That's a good point.

279
00:30:30,653 --> 00:30:32,348
There you go.

280
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:36,634
There. There!

281
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,192
That'II give you time
to think about what you're doing.

282
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:41,752
But first, a word of advice. Stop.

283
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:47,638
Because when you get close,
I will win every time.

284
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:50,104
You think?

285
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:55,504
-I'm not the one in a cage.
-No, you're not.

286
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:58,611
There's one big difference
between you and I, Michael.

287
00:30:59,165 --> 00:31:01,531
And you just proved it.

288
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:03,030
You can't kill.

289
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:05,863
And that's what it's gonna take
to stop me.

290
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:08,249
Because I don't have
the same reservations.

291
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:10,012
I can't.

292
00:31:11,005 --> 00:31:14,065
So whether it's today in Gila
or tomorrow in AIbuquerque...

293
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:17,340
...or two months from now in Panama...

294
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:21,067
...I will get you.

295
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,116
I don't have a choice.

296
00:31:50,813 --> 00:31:52,644
I bought us some time.

297
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:56,066
-You okay? You're bleeding.
-Let's go.

298
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:57,856
Get your seatbelt.

299
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:17,036
Here, 804.

300
00:32:17,117 --> 00:32:18,550
Move.

301
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:40,220
Ain't that the most beautiful thing
you ever seen?

302
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:42,187
AII that green.

303
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:44,831
It's prettier than the Grand Canyon.

304
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:47,555
You know, Roy, this is a monumental
moment for both of us.

305
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:48,910
Hand over the bag, Bradley.

306
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:52,538
-Put down the pounder, Grandma.
-Hey, hey, I'm not kidding around.

307
00:32:52,573 --> 00:32:54,973
Oh, you think your pansy ass--?

308
00:33:07,357 --> 00:33:09,882
Next time, you pick through the crap.

309
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:42,995
Okay, first-aid kit, disposable phones,
a couple of toothbrushes.

310
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:44,233
What about the motel?

311
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,836
They charge by the hour,
so they didn't ask for ID.

312
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:56,750
-Do you have the keys?
-Yeah.

313
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:00,723
Want your hat?

314
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:18,217
Sorry, we're not home. Leave a message
at the beep and we'll get back to you.

315
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:21,570
Theresa, this message is for Maricruz.

316
00:34:21,597 --> 00:34:24,293
I was right there waiting for your call...

317
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:27,011
...but the cops showed up
and I couldn't pick up the phone.

318
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:31,802
I know probably that's the exact reason
why you may not wanna be with me.

319
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:33,865
Listen to me.

320
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:37,280
My Aunt Idalyz,
she Iives outside Mexico City.

321
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:42,717
In the mountains, on a farm,
with a IIama for the baby to ride.

322
00:34:42,717 --> 00:34:46,813
So next week,
when you fly back home...

323
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:49,782
...when you go to the airport,
I'II be there.

324
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,790
In the airport, in Ixtapa, waiting for you.

325
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:55,491
I promise you, mi vida.

326
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,540
I Iove you, Mommy.
I Iove you more than anything.

327
00:34:58,621 --> 00:35:00,782
And I can't Iive without you.

328
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:05,355
I just know I can make it work, baby.

329
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:10,264
This is in case you run into trouble
down the road.

330
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,303
I have a way.

331
00:35:18,045 --> 00:35:19,444
-Where is she?
-Who?

332
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:22,017
Maricruz. She wasn't at home.
She's not at work.

333
00:35:22,077 --> 00:35:24,511
Well, she's not here.
I don't know where she is.

334
00:35:24,573 --> 00:35:27,235
You trying to cause problems for me, bitch?
Don't Iie to me.

335
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:36,447
She went to Mexico, didn't she?

336
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:39,762
Went on our honeymoon.

337
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:43,579
Paid for with my money.

338
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:49,834
This isn't gonna feel good.

339
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:52,715
I have a high tolerance for pain.
You know that.

340
00:35:52,765 --> 00:35:54,255
You do.

341
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:58,108
And you're not a diabetic, are you?

342
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:03,704
Right.

343
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:14,121
Michael, tell me something.

344
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:18,220
You think there's a part of you
that enjoys this?

345
00:36:18,461 --> 00:36:21,157
Peroxide in an open wound? No.

346
00:36:22,173 --> 00:36:25,199
I mean escaping from prison...

347
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:29,404
...and being on the run and the danger
and the fear and the rush. AII that.

348
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:30,996
It....

349
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:35,486
It feels to me Iike chasing a high.

350
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:42,070
And I know what that's Iike...

351
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:44,509
...and I should know better by now.

352
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:49,573
I never thought about it Iike that.

353
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:58,881
I know you've heard this before...

354
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:01,341
...but it won't always be Iike this.

355
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:04,317
From everything you've told me,
it's getting worse.

356
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:06,008
They can't chase us forever.

357
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:08,577
The guy who caught up with us today
stops at the border.

358
00:37:08,637 --> 00:37:10,730
That's why we have to get across.

359
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,940
I have the people in place
to help us do that.

360
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:14,955
We're meeting them tomorrow.

361
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,928
One more day, Sara.

362
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,371
One more day.

363
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:25,667
That's all I'm asking.

364
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,708
You can go get cleaned up.

365
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:31,312
Keep this dry.

366
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,491
Sara...

367
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,433
...I'm glad you came.

368
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:01,843
So...

369
00:38:03,837 --> 00:38:05,327
...this is him.

370
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:07,337
Lincoln Junior.

371
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:11,163
-Named him after yourself.
-I wasn't gonna name him AIdo.

372
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:16,444
L.J...

373
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,008
...this is your grandfather...

374
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:20,536
...AIdo Burrows.

375
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,959
Hi.

376
00:38:25,468 --> 00:38:28,198
I've waited for this for a Iong time.

377
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:37,449
I've arranged a safe place
for both of you to go to.

378
00:38:40,189 --> 00:38:42,919
Well, thanks for bailing us out...

379
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:44,406
...but we gotta meet Michael.

380
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:46,064
Where is he?

381
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:49,961
Down by the border.
A place called Bolshoi Booze.

382
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,971
-I can go alone and get him.
-No.

383
00:38:55,549 --> 00:38:57,380
Things are different.

384
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,061
There's some evidence.

385
00:38:59,164 --> 00:39:00,825
We just need a Iittle more time...

386
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:03,325
...and we can blow this whole thing
wide open.

387
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:06,847
There is no time. I trust Michael.
He has a plan to get us to Panama.

388
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,708
You don't understand, Lincoln.

389
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:10,992
You don't need to go to Panama.

390
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:13,633
You don't need to run anymore.

391
00:39:16,508 --> 00:39:18,100
Where is he?

392
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,480
I can go alone to get him.

393
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:24,591
-Tell me good news.
-Hey.

394
00:39:24,636 --> 00:39:27,605
I got Burrows. The trifecta.

395
00:39:28,253 --> 00:39:30,050
-Take care of them.
-What about Scofield?

396
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,301
-They're gonna meet him.
-It doesn 't matter.

397
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:34,564
Do it now.

398
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:12,404
Sara?

399
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,180
Hi, Sara.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
