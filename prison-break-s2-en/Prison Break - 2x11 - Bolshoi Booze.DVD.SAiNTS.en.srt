1
00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:03,050
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:07,011
There's one big difference
between you and I, Michael.

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:08,633
You can't kill.

4
00:00:08,803 --> 00:00:09,861
I will get you.

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,577
This is...

6
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:14,828
...in case you run into trouble
down the road.

7
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:17,247
Lincoln, he really wants to see you
and your brother.

8
00:00:17,315 --> 00:00:19,715
He hasn't seen Michael
since he was 10 years old.

9
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:20,768
Let's go.

10
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:23,595
Michael never met
your grandfather. Dad.

11
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:25,812
-I got Burrows.
-Take care of them.

12
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,121
You think there's a part of you
that enjoys this?

13
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,459
It feels to me Iike chasing a high...

14
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,523
...and I should know better by now.

15
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,072
Sara?

16
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:39,875
Hi, Sara.

17
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:41,753
Hey, what is this?

18
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:45,556
It's for my blood pressure.

19
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:47,937
-Geary, come on. We can make a deal, man.
-No deals.

20
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:50,301
You just crapped out
your Iast bargaining chip, pal.

21
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:53,431
Ain't that the most beautiful thing
you ever seen?

22
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,224
This is the Tribune police.

23
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:26,364
This is the Tribune police.
Make yourself known.

24
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:32,386
Code 4. AII clear.

25
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:42,780
Hey, you're in Iuck.

26
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:45,859
-I had a case in back.
-Excellent.

27
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:48,724
Fishing reel oil.

28
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:51,525
And you want the whole case?

29
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,447
Whole case.

30
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,358
And the GPS?

31
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:02,183
-And the GPS.
-Must do quite a bit of fishing.

32
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:05,476
Yeah, a Iot of fishing.
Not a whole Iot of catching.

33
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:09,237
Ninety-six dollars and 23 cents.

34
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:15,989
You know...

35
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:19,399
...I'm just gonna take the reel oil.

36
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,694
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

37
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:34,464
Hey, you have to pay for that.

38
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:44,117
Just take it. PIease don't hurt me.

39
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:46,078
PIease.

40
00:03:00,355 --> 00:03:01,617
You have to pay for that.

41
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:04,177
The vault. Open it.

42
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:06,636
Come on, pretty.

43
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:13,528
I wasn 't going for me,
I was going for my daughter.

44
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:16,131
Give Emma her papa's Iove.

45
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:20,501
I'm gonna cut your throat out.

46
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:24,422
I Ioved you, Michael,
but you just used me.

47
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:29,091
Cops found your girlfriend,
fish-belly white, gargling in her own puke.

48
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:32,254
And what do you care?
As Iong as she Ieft the door open for you.

49
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,383
I feel very fortunate to have met you.

50
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:38,535
I'm sorry, Henry.

51
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,694
It's corporate interests
taking over...

52
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:05,975
...buying elections, fighting wars.

53
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:08,452
People dying so they can turn a profit.

54
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:13,213
-We're trying to stop it.
-What are you, a bunch of spies?

55
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:15,566
Just a handful of senators, congressmen.

56
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:18,313
People Iike me
that once worked for The Company.

57
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:21,272
People willing to expose the president
for what she is.

58
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:23,374
A shill working for these corporations.

59
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:26,326
We bring her down, we bring them down.

60
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:27,838
What's it got to do with me?

61
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:32,034
Because the way we'II bring her down is
also what we're gonna use to set you free.

62
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:34,366
About a week ago,
we finally got a break.

63
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:37,632
An NSA analyst
sympathetic to our cause...

64
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,763
...finally worked his way up
and got clearance into the Echelon program.

65
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,560
E-mails, cell-phone calls
all across this country.

66
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,901
If it's transmitted,
it goes through Echelon.

67
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:51,856
It's cataloged, interpreted,
and then stored for Homeland Security.

68
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,467
Nothing is missed by them.

69
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:54,857
Nothing.

70
00:04:54,978 --> 00:05:00,507
Including, by accident,
for a few months after 9/1 1...

71
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:02,260
...the White House.

72
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:06,329
The analyst got his hands on
a phone conversation the president had...

73
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:11,088
...with Terrence Steadman,
two weeks after you supposedly killed him.

74
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:16,111
The analyst tried to get
this information out of the building.

75
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:19,599
Excuse me. Could you come with us?
We need to ask you a few questions, sir.

76
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,382
Turns out someone else
was snooping too.

77
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:29,439
Someone else wanted answers
about the president.

78
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:32,863
I'm convinced
they're turning the....

79
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:35,989
-AIdo and Lincoln wanna be Ieft alone.
-Sure, I understand.

80
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:44,346
Twenty-four hours Iater,
Tancredi is dead, the analyst is missing...

81
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:48,792
...and the White House Echelon tapes
have been deleted from the mainframe.

82
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,229
The tape is still out there.

83
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:56,216
And judging by how hard they're going
after Sara Tancredi...

84
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:58,887
...I'm pretty sure they think she has it.

85
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:01,596
And I think they're right.

86
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,635
She's the key
to this whole thing, Lincoln.

87
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:40,958
L.J., come with me.

88
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:47,254
Season 2
Episode 11
Bolshoi Booze

89
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,063
I would imagine...

90
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:21,755
...that you're feeling
slightly betrayed right now.

91
00:08:23,298 --> 00:08:25,027
I understand.

92
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:35,687
As you can see...

93
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:39,389
...hi, my name is not Lance,
and I'm not an addict.

94
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,062
Okay.

95
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:43,924
There's one thing about me...

96
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:46,333
...that should mean a great deal to you
right now...

97
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:48,370
...and that is,
I am reasonable.

98
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:51,443
If you tell me what you know,
you get to go.

99
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,754
And then maybe,
when this is all behind us...

100
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:56,659
...we get to grab a piece of pie
for old time's sake.

101
00:08:56,706 --> 00:08:58,071
Okay? Come here.

102
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:06,069
I don't know where Michael is.

103
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,613
This is not about Michael,
this is about your father.

104
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,892
He Ieft Washington with something
that didn't belong to him...

105
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:13,486
...and we need it back.

106
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:15,468
-And you killed him for it.
-I didn't.

107
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:18,182
No, for what that's worth.

108
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:21,297
But I hope that his death
properly illustrates...

109
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:24,747
...the magnitude of the situation
that we're in right now.

110
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:30,432
So where is it?

111
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:33,986
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Where is it?

112
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,422
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Where is it?

113
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:40,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

114
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,515
Sara, there's a next step
involved in this...

115
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:46,148
...and you don't want to experience that.

116
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:53,525
I swear to God,
I don't know what you're talking about.

117
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:56,131
My father didn't give me anything.

118
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:59,278
I don't know what you're talking about.

119
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,168
BIess me, Father, for I have sinned.

120
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:26,385
How Iong has it been
since your Iast confession?

121
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:27,661
This is my first time...

122
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,161
...in a Iong time.

123
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,195
And what are the nature of your sins?

124
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:35,941
The nature?

125
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:39,506
I'm not really sure.

126
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:43,058
Deep down inside your heart, you know.

127
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:46,624
Righteousness, maybe.

128
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:49,931
Believing the ends justify the means.

129
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:52,079
And what are those ends?

130
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:54,223
Saving someone's Iife.

131
00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:56,952
And the means?

132
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:00,634
I've broken just about
every Iaw you can name.

133
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:03,837
But it's not just what I've done.

134
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:06,587
It's what others have done...

135
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,195
...because I Iet them.

136
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,619
Because I was doing
what I thought was right.

137
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,610
-I should have known better this time.
-This time?

138
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,384
When I was a kid...

139
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,598
...I watched a man bleed out and die.

140
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,948
And I was glad...

141
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,945
...because he deserved it.

142
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,476
Life is only for God
to give and take, my son.

143
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:40,974
Suddenly, there was this
dark space inside of me...

144
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:43,706
...and I knew it was wrong.

145
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,739
-But here I am.
-There is a way to stop this.

146
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:51,559
Surrender your will to God.

147
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:54,065
If I surrender now...

148
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,004
...I Iose everything I Iove.

149
00:11:57,315 --> 00:12:01,376
But do you Iose your soul in the process?

150
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:07,447
Well, we all have our crosses to bear.

151
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,339
You okay?

152
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:20,385
This is never gonna stop.
They're gonna keep coming after us.

153
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,022
Lincoln, don't.

154
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,191
-Is it done?
-You are.

155
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,773
-Lincoln Burrows.
- Your man 's dead.

156
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:52,238
Just Iike anyone else you send
to take out my son.

157
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,569
We want you.
This isn't about L.J.

158
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:59,761
There's a very simple way
for all of this to end.

159
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:01,070
I'II tell you how it'II end.

160
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:04,314
Me staring into your dead eye
with my hand around your throat.

161
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,490
You don't even know who I am.

162
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:16,543
How much further?

163
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:27,873
Right here is good.

164
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,767
Right. You got it.

165
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:38,358
-Thanks for the ride.
-No problem.

166
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,522
Agent Mahone. Bill Kim.

167
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,768
I'm here to pick you up.

168
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:50,469
I called Kellerman.

169
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:52,499
He's busy right now.

170
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:56,700
-Does anyone else know you're here?
-No.

171
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,170
-Good.
-Can you open the gate?

172
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,654
And I need a new vehicle.

173
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:04,907
There's something
you should know about me.

174
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,267
I don't Iike being out in the field.
I only do so when there's been a screwup.

175
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:13,783
I'm out in the field, AIex.

176
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,221
Why don't you open the gate...

177
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,767
...and you can hurry back to D.C.
before your shoes get dirty?

178
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,485
We have a Iead as to where Burrows
will meet with his brother.

179
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,055
It's a place he referred
to as Bolshoi Booze.

180
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:26,384
That mean anything to you?

181
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:29,059
Yeah, it's one of a hundred tattoos
on Scofield's body.

182
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:31,591
-What does it mean?
-I don't know yet.

183
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:34,085
You need to figure it out
in the next couple of hours.

184
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:37,707
If Scofield and Burrows cross the border,
they'II be out of your jurisdiction...

185
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,255
...and you'II be of no further value to us.

186
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,533
-Open the gate.
-So you can do what?

187
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:49,685
I wanna hear it. Straight from the mouth
of the guy who's supposed to be our closer.

188
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,429
I'II get Scofield and Burrows
and all the rest of them.

189
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:57,294
And then me and you and Kellerman...

190
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,894
...we're gonna part ways.

191
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:01,351
I just hope you're properly motivated.

192
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,340
Because as Iong as you do your job,
we forget about Shales.

193
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,221
And then you can go back to Colorado
and visit your son, Cameron.

194
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:26,020
He's 5, right?

195
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,390
Don't you ever mention his name again.

196
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:33,009
There he is.

197
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:36,900
That's what I wanted to hear.

198
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,081
Get cracking, AIex.

199
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,210
A Iot of people are relying on you.

200
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,635
Jane will take care of it.
You can trust her.

201
00:16:56,674 --> 00:17:00,132
I know this is hard, but it will work out.
You have my word.

202
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,925
-Thank you.
-Be careful.

203
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,975
Listen....

204
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:18,241
I know.

205
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,247
Jane's gonna Iook after you.

206
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,395
-I don't even know her.
-She's all right.

207
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:27,076
She's been working for Dad for a while.

208
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,255
I'II....

209
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:32,553
I'II see you soon, I promise.

210
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:36,525
Isn't that the same thing
your dad told you?

211
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:38,461
Yeah, but I mean it.

212
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,043
Hey.

213
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:28,643
Bo-- No.

214
00:19:09,794 --> 00:19:11,421
Hey, it's me.

215
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:15,192
Just call me when you get this, okay?
It's important.

216
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,288
They're numbers.

217
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,079
Is that my payment?

218
00:20:48,386 --> 00:20:51,184
-Medical nitroglycerin?
-As promised.

219
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,217
You have no idea how hard it is
to get this kind of grade.

220
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,456
Even with my contacts.

221
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,137
It's time for your end of the deal.
Where's that plane gonna be?

222
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:12,707
They call me a couple of hours
before with the drop-off point.

223
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,433
Keeps the DEA off our backs.

224
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,910
So it's gonna be a while.
You might wanna stay out of the sun.

225
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,557
Hey, hey, hey.

226
00:21:26,657 --> 00:21:28,147
Hey.

227
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:30,895
Is there a problem?

228
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:32,998
They're just my cousins.

229
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:47,479
Now, after your father accessed
this information...

230
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:52,450
...he made three calls from his cell phone,
all to you.

231
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,747
What did he tell you?

232
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:56,088
Just that he was coming back
to Chicago.

233
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,150
Good. You're being honest. Good.

234
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:02,354
Now, there's a half an hour
between when your father Ianded...

235
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,962
...and when he got home
that is unaccounted for.

236
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:07,324
I know you stopped by his office.
You see him there?

237
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:08,861
No.

238
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:11,430
The Iast time I saw my father,
he was dead in his study.

239
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,957
He have anyone
give you anything?

240
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:16,585
You think I'm just withholding information
because I Iike hanging out with you?

241
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,669
If I knew something,
I would tell you. I don't.

242
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,687
I don't know anything about any of this.

243
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:25,473
Really? Then why did you give your father
the file on Lincoln Burrows?

244
00:22:25,473 --> 00:22:27,668
Why open the door for Scofield,
help him escape?

245
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:29,679
Why did Scofield send you
those coded notes?

246
00:22:29,761 --> 00:22:33,288
Why did you come to New Mexico
to meet him?

247
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:38,430
Don't try to float
a babe-in-the-woods routine by me.

248
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:40,693
It's really gonna piss me off.

249
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,601
So come on.

250
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,293
Okay, come on.

251
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:03,255
You're okay.

252
00:23:05,506 --> 00:23:07,064
AII right.

253
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,204
Look, Sara...

254
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:19,078
...we're gonna have to come
to an understanding. You know that, right?

255
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,852
Yeah, you were right.
They are coordinates.

256
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:32,365
PIug them into your GPS. It'II take you
to a spot in the New Mexico desert.

257
00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:34,479
It's in the middle of nowhere, basically.

258
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:36,928
-AII right, thanks.
-Yeah, no problem.

259
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:38,461
Sir, who are you meeting--?

260
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,665
What the hell is he doing?

261
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:44,753
He's keeping us out of the Ioop,
that's what he's doing.

262
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:49,348
You know, constantly running from the Iaw
with a bad heart.

263
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,006
Mexico, where I'm from,
has got a Iot of great things...

264
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:55,118
...but health care ain't one of them.

265
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:58,637
You all right? You Iook a Iittle nervous.

266
00:23:58,658 --> 00:24:00,057
I don't do this every day.

267
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:04,928
I just wanna get the information
on that plane and move on.

268
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,650
-Is that it?
-That's it.

269
00:24:09,474 --> 00:24:12,272
Because I know who you are.
Oh, you don't have to worry.

270
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:15,849
We can't go within a hundred feet
of a federal marshal to collect the reward...

271
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:19,206
...because we got U.S.
and Mexican warrants on our head.

272
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:23,933
But this plane to Panama....
Sit down.

273
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:34,532
-This is all for your brother?
-Yes.

274
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:37,827
I got four brothers. Two in prison.

275
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,451
Accept a call? Yes. But break them out?

276
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:46,669
My brother gave me a baseball mitt
for my 1 4th birthday.

277
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:47,917
I owed him.

278
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,853
You're a better man than I am.

279
00:24:50,177 --> 00:24:51,872
Time will tell.

280
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:03,241
Shouldn't they have called by now
about the plane?

281
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:04,890
Yeah.

282
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:08,554
But you know, I have a question.

283
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:12,562
I thought that these came in glass vials...

284
00:25:13,858 --> 00:25:14,882
...not plastic.

285
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:18,426
I thought so too.

286
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:21,054
The guy I bought it from
said he packed it in plastic...

287
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:25,889
...for transportation over Iong distances
to prevent a fire or an explosion.

288
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:27,539
Really?

289
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:30,003
I never heard of that.

290
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:40,717
What's going on?

291
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:43,048
We're gonna do
a Iittle quality-control test.

292
00:25:43,137 --> 00:25:44,365
It's the best available.

293
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:46,926
We got time.

294
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:22,206
For the Iast time, some black male,
early 20s, jumped me from behind.

295
00:26:22,241 --> 00:26:23,833
Didn't get a good Iook at his face.

296
00:26:23,938 --> 00:26:26,702
-Assailant attacked you from behind?
-That's what I just said.

297
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,948
Yet he managed to make contact
on your forehead.

298
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:31,550
-That's right.
-With what? A boomerang?

299
00:26:31,618 --> 00:26:33,609
Come on, why don't you
tell me what happened?

300
00:26:33,698 --> 00:26:36,826
Look, I'm a retired correctional officer
out of IIIinois.

301
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:40,302
How about showing
some professional courtesy, honey?

302
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:50,221
This is Roy Geary. Leave a message.

303
00:26:50,306 --> 00:26:52,206
You thieving son of a bitch.

304
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,487
You better get down on your knees
and pray to God that I don't find you.

305
00:26:55,522 --> 00:27:00,221
Because if I do, mark my words,
I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

306
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:05,272
President Reynolds was in Tallahassee,
Florida early this morning...

307
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:08,283
...attending a $5000-a-plate
breakfast fundraiser...

308
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:11,449
...for Senator Martin Kleinhenz,
who 's running for reelection.

309
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,186
Later this afternoon,
her press conference was derailed...

310
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:18,593
... when a reporter asked her to comment
on Lincoln Burrows ' escape from custody.

311
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:21,960
She declined. It's become clear
in her first month in office...

312
00:27:21,986 --> 00:27:25,353
... that she cannot separate herself
from this manhunt.

313
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:27,141
And as long as it continues...

314
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:30,828
...pundits say that questions
about Burrows will--

315
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:38,588
Ladies. Let' s get this party started.

316
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:40,817
For the Iast 30 years,
I've hated you.

317
00:27:41,153 --> 00:27:43,246
You walked out on me.

318
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,139
You haven't even seen Michael.

319
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:49,949
I've seen him before.

320
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,534
Not in the papers, Dad.

321
00:27:54,434 --> 00:27:57,597
I've been trying to work out
what kind of man abandons his family.

322
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:02,273
Now I'm doing the same damn thing.

323
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:07,191
You'II see him again. I'II make sure of it.

324
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:13,245
-How much further?
-About three hours.

325
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:23,309
-It's gonna be a few minutes.
-My brother should be here soon.

326
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:25,386
I should go outside.
Make sure he can see me.

327
00:28:25,473 --> 00:28:27,941
That's a good idea.
I'm gonna send Ernesto to do that.

328
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:42,840
Hello.

329
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,456
Was that the call?

330
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:56,996
-Yes, it was.
-About the plane?

331
00:29:03,105 --> 00:29:04,800
Sugar water.

332
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:06,762
No, you just made
a big mistake, blanquito.

333
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,374
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?
I'm not a chemist.

334
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:12,740
The guy I bought it from
swore it was medical nitro.

335
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:15,602
-We both got screwed.
-Yeah, but one of us is gonna pay for it.

336
00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:17,947
I just wanna get out of here,
you want your payment.

337
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:20,042
My brother's gonna be here soon...

338
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:23,081
...we'II work something out.
Just name your price.

339
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:27,335
I already named my price.
You didn't come through.

340
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:40,894
When's your brother getting here?

341
00:29:40,994 --> 00:29:43,792
You were planning on turning us in
the whole time, weren't you?

342
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:45,433
When's he supposed to meet you here?

343
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:50,466
-Drop it or I'm gonna shoot him.
-Let him go or I'II shoot you.

344
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:12,756
-Where is it?
-My father didn't give me anything.

345
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:17,307
Who are you risking your Iife for?

346
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:20,429
Lincoln Burrows.

347
00:30:21,505 --> 00:30:23,200
A street thug.

348
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:27,473
Why is that your concern? Is there
somewhere in the Hippocratic oath...

349
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:31,321
...where it says, " I pledge to risk my Iife
for those who don't care about mine"?

350
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,354
Because they don't care about yours.

351
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:38,032
Burrows and Michael Scofield,
they just used you.

352
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:42,433
Are you that surprised there are people in
the world who'II stand up to people Iike you?

353
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:46,165
-Are you that far gone?
-That's cute.

354
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,670
Sad, but cute.

355
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,494
A CIeveland what?

356
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:08,288
Don't worry, I'II talk you through it.

357
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:11,650
And we got a glass
coffee table right here.

358
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:16,035
-Hell no.
-I'II do it for a thousand.

359
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,121
Five hundred.

360
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,007
One thousand.

361
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:22,258
Seven-fifty.

362
00:31:22,977 --> 00:31:24,968
AII right.

363
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:38,157
What the hell?

364
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,566
Leave.

365
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,970
You know...

366
00:31:55,073 --> 00:31:59,567
...it's amazing what you can pick up
at an Army-Navy store.

367
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,683
AII that torture stuff,
that was Bellick's idea.

368
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:05,620
And if you ask me,
he took the whole thing way too far.

369
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:09,192
Listen, why don't I just give you
half the money and we call it a day, huh?

370
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:10,479
AII right, sixty-forty.

371
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:12,736
Come on, T, we can deal.

372
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:20,914
Where's the plane gonna Iand?

373
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:22,984
Kiss my ass, cobarde.

374
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:30,533
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

375
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:33,000
We won't get across the border
on the ground.

376
00:32:33,505 --> 00:32:34,972
Without that plane,
we're screwed.

377
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:37,303
He's Iosing too much blood.
He'II never make it.

378
00:32:37,377 --> 00:32:39,402
Should've thought of that
before he tried to kill us.

379
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:42,458
We gotta take him to the hospital
or else he'II die.

380
00:32:42,497 --> 00:32:43,828
PIease.

381
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:47,967
The plane, and we'II Iet you go.

382
00:32:59,585 --> 00:33:01,450
Finley Road.

383
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:04,564
-Off Highway 8. There's an airstrip there.
-There.

384
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,099
Okay? Now, Iet us go.

385
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:07,540
-Okay, Iet's go.
-No, no, no.

386
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:10,117
-Michael, Iet's go.
-No, no, don't go.

387
00:33:10,177 --> 00:33:12,270
-PIease.
-Michael, Iet's go.

388
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:14,480
PIease, help us.
No, don't do this, huh?

389
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:16,324
Don't do this. Don't do it. PIease.

390
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:20,673
Let's go. Michael, if we were bleeding,
they would not Iift a finger. You know that.

391
00:33:20,673 --> 00:33:22,971
-He was gonna kill us. Let's go.
-That's not true.

392
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:26,300
Michael, we're gonna get to that plane,
and we'II call when we're safe.

393
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,601
-Let's go now, please.
-PIease don't do this, okay?

394
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:34,441
Don't do this! Don't do it, all right?
Don't Iisten to him! PIease.

395
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:39,560
I care about you.

396
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:43,270
This is not what I wanted, Sara.

397
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,762
Kellerman.

398
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:57,500
What's going on with Sara?

399
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:59,466
Has she told you anything?

400
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:02,398
Don't go anywhere.

401
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:06,462
-Not yet.
-I trust you've been persuasive.

402
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:09,681
- Yes, absolutely.
-Then kill her.

403
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:14,683
Well, if she knows something....

404
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:19,388
You disobey me, you are done.
Do you understand me?

405
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:23,794
Put her in the ground, Paul.

406
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:12,350
Michael.

407
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:13,869
Let's go.

408
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:15,919
-Michael.
-Hold still.

409
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,408
You're doing it wrong.
Let's get out of here.

410
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:20,488
He was gonna call the cops,
get his buddies--

411
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:21,669
He's not gonna make it.

412
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,813
We'II call when we get safe.
Let's go. Michael, Iet's go!

413
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,189
Thank you. Thank you.

414
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:31,038
You gotta get him to a hospital
right away.

415
00:35:43,873 --> 00:35:45,841
Wait, wait, wait.

416
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:50,037
Hey, man, forget Finley Road.

417
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:53,202
The plane's gonna stop
at the 7-mile marker...

418
00:35:53,249 --> 00:35:55,444
...Route 4, at sunset.

419
00:35:55,521 --> 00:36:00,000
It's gonna stop for five minutes,
then it's gonna go to Oaxaca, Mexico.

420
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,764
You miss it, you're out of Iuck.

421
00:36:12,801 --> 00:36:15,565
-He bled out on the way over.
-Any ID?

422
00:36:15,617 --> 00:36:19,678
Yeah, Roy Geary. Just an out-of-stater.

423
00:36:28,737 --> 00:36:31,934
-You know him?
-He's a friend of mine.

424
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,403
-Mr. Bellick?
-Yeah.

425
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:39,472
Would you mind
answering a few more questions?

426
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:49,396
-Yeah.
-It's Pam.

427
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:51,838
What's going on?

428
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:55,454
I just wanted to say hey.

429
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:59,422
Well, are you all right?
You said it was important.

430
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:05,610
I know things
got kind of ugly toward the--

431
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:08,200
You know, the end.

432
00:37:08,897 --> 00:37:10,728
I got ugly.

433
00:37:10,817 --> 00:37:15,413
But I want you to know
that there were circumstances that....

434
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:18,977
It was better that you and Cameron....

435
00:37:19,457 --> 00:37:20,890
That you were not with me.

436
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:23,778
Why are you telling me this now?

437
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,742
If I had to do it all over again...

438
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:29,292
...I'd do it different, you know?

439
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:33,306
We'd still be a family.

440
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:36,285
I'd give anything for that.

441
00:37:38,337 --> 00:37:41,204
-I just wanted you to know.
-Alex...

442
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:44,089
-...what's going on?
-Nothing.

443
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,925
I just wanted to call
to say that I was....

444
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:55,298
-That I'm sorry about everything.
-Where are you right now?

445
00:37:55,393 --> 00:37:58,123
-I can come get you.
-Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

446
00:37:58,177 --> 00:38:00,202
No, I'm serious. Where are you?

447
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:02,312
One more thing.

448
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:06,349
-If you hear anything in the media....
-What?

449
00:38:07,265 --> 00:38:09,358
What are you talking about?

450
00:38:14,304 --> 00:38:17,398
I Iove you.
Give Cam a kiss for me, okay?

451
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:04,453
Well, I'm glad I told you about this place.

452
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,505
I'm glad I figured out
how to work a GPS.

453
00:39:06,785 --> 00:39:08,650
Make it a Iittle more
difficult next time?

454
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:11,001
-I owe you one.
-No, we're even.

455
00:39:11,073 --> 00:39:13,234
But we gotta Ieave.

456
00:39:14,336 --> 00:39:17,794
-Linc.
-Hey, buddy.

457
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:19,850
-How you doing?
-Where's L.J.?

458
00:39:19,936 --> 00:39:23,099
-He's safe. The money?
-I'II tell you Iater. We gotta go.

459
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:24,536
I brought someone.

460
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,357
Dad.

461
00:39:40,864 --> 00:39:42,092
We've met before.

462
00:40:06,049 --> 00:40:08,677
This is happening right now, okay?

463
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:10,419
Don't make me do this.

464
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:12,588
Don't make me do this.

465
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:15,118
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

466
00:40:15,201 --> 00:40:17,965
You wouldn't? Really?
Are you that stupid?

467
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:19,597
Are you that stupid?

468
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,771
Because now you're going to die!

469
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:23,212
You're going to die.

470
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:27,425
And all you had to do was tell me
what your father gave you.

471
00:40:27,937 --> 00:40:29,700
I know my options.

472
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:33,422
I can not tell you and die
or I can tell you and still die.

473
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:34,900
No, wrong.

474
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:39,639
Sara, come on.
Smarten up for once in your Iife.

475
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,947
PIease.

476
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:51,012
Go to hell.

477
00:40:55,777 --> 00:40:58,940
You know what?
Drowning is horrific...

478
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,967
...don't get me wrong,
but once you give in...

479
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:05,153
...and just Iet the water come into your
Iungs, there's a certain euphoria, I hear.

480
00:41:05,153 --> 00:41:08,452
I guess as a junkie,
I thought maybe you'd appreciate that.

481
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,412
You did this to yourself.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
