<i>Previously on Prison Break</i>

2
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:04,394
There's something about this guy.

3
00:00:04,606 --> 00:00:07,181
It's like he knows where we're going
and what we're thinking.

4
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:09,457
<i>If it's true, it won't be long
before he finds out</i>

5
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:10,438
<i>about the money in Utah,</i>

6
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,505
our way into Mexico... Everything.

7
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:20,928
...have an attorney present

8
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:22,718
during questioning
now or in the future...

9
00:00:22,737 --> 00:00:24,049
Caroline, they're taking her in.

10
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,526
Of course. I'll keep an eye on her.

11
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:27,132
I did it, Dad.

12
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:29,094
Just do as you're told.

13
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,402
Otherwise, there will be consequences

14
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,886
that will affect us all.

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,966
My dad's an Air Force colonel.

16
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:38,495
When I told him I was staying
in a hotel with a guy that...

17
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:40,522
I maybe sorta liked,

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,762
he lost it.

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,492
What are you doing here?
Where's Maricruz?

20
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:46,532
She's with me now.

21
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:47,770
He's gonna be where she is.

22
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:49,683
Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.

23
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:52,469
I was trying to tell you,
the wedding is in Vegas.

24
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,159
Which one of them was it?

25
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:57,315
Might be Scofield.

26
00:00:57,426 --> 00:00:59,410
Probably gonna find his brother
in there, too.

27
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,359
<i>Where to, sir?</i>

28
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,550
Utah.

29
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,702
<i>This morning, authorities in Illinois</i>

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,744
<i>issued an update on the escaped convicts</i>

31
00:01:15,802 --> 00:01:18,248
<i>known until now as the Fox River Eight.</i>

32
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:21,164
<i>Chicago mob boss John Abruzzi
was gunned down</i>

33
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:23,731
<i>outside a Washington D. C. motel
last night,</i>

34
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,780
<i>after investigators received a tip
from an informant.</i>

35
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,331
<i>The other seven escapees</i>

36
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:30,894
<i>are still at large
and considered dangerous.</i>

37
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:33,514
<i>A Florida man wanted in...</i>

38
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:37,968
I didn't think Abruzzi'd be
the first to hit it.

39
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:40,992
I have a feeling we're in
for lots of surprises.

40
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,913
They said seven are still out there.

41
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:44,396
So much for faking our deaths.

42
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,430
I bought us some time,
that's what counts.

43
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,686
How much further?

44
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,050
70, 80 miles.

45
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,671
Good. Means we should be hitting

46
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,212
the Double K Ranch by this afternoon.

47
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,138
Or we can pick up L.J. and hit Panama.

48
00:01:58,177 --> 00:01:59,486
We can't hit Panama!

49
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,557
We can't hit anything! We can't do
anything without the money.

50
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:04,792
We need to find Charles's stash.

51
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:09,650
I know some other guys
who are thinking the same thing.

52
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,914
The money is buried under a silo
at the Double K Ranch

53
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:20,801
just outside of Tooele, Utah.

54
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,442
There's five million dollars there.

55
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,257
<i>Tickets?</i>

56
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:44,187
You know, when I was in Cheyenne,

57
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,119
I pulled my ticket out of the bag.

58
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,110
It tore in half, and...

59
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,132
I have no idea what happened
to the other part.

60
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:52,550
They didn't issue you a replacement?

61
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,412
No. The young lady,
I think her name was Sherry,

62
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,550
she actually said
that this half is okay

63
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,045
because the bar code is on it.

64
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:01,010
Well, you really need the whole ticket.

65
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,934
This is exactly
what I was trying to avoid.

66
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:06,069
She said that everything
would be fine because...

67
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:07,525
That's okay. It'll do for now.

68
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:09,760
But make sure you ask for a replacement

69
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:10,935
when you get to Provo.

70
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,450
I definitely will. Thank you.

71
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:15,730
It's always something, huh?

72
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:17,175
Oh, God, I know.

73
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,450
I don't wanna go home.

74
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,649
I wish we could keep driving.

75
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:37,274
I don't think your pops
will be down for that.

76
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,950
Wouldn't it be fun?

77
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,506
We could go to...

78
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:45,167
Hawaii?

79
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,808
Yo, you can't drive to Hawaii.

80
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:49,948
I know.

81
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:51,692
I'm just saying

82
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,860
I wish.

83
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:58,550
No, no. Don't get it. They'll leave.

84
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:00,195
Just let me see who it is.

85
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:07,114
It's a cop.

86
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,194
No, no, no, no.

87
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,553
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

88
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,364
Have you happened to see this person?

90
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,092
Last night we got a few phone calls

91
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,675
that he was spotted in the area.

92
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:56,464
So we're going door-to-door.

93
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,975
Why are you looking for him?

94
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,583
He escaped from prison in Illinois

95
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,882
a couple of days ago.

96
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:03,187
Have you seen him?

97
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,557
No.

98
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,776
He doesn't look familiar.

99
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,633
Are you sure?

100
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,450
Yeah. I'm sure.

101
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:21,390
All right. Thanks for your time.

102
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:30,756
This ain't...

103
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:33,009
This is not what you think, all right?

104
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,292
Look.

105
00:05:34,823 --> 00:05:37,455
Listen to me, this... Just... listen.

106
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,949
Okay?

107
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,954
All I did was steal a baseball card.

108
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,450
Okay? I'm not like those other fools
up in there.

109
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:49,879
I'm gonna go for a walk, okay?

110
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:53,049
- Listen...
- I'm gonna leave my keys right here.

111
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:55,150
And when I come back,

112
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,404
my car will be gone.

113
00:05:58,618 --> 00:05:59,591
I'm sure,

114
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,949
in a few hours,

115
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,932
they'll find it somewhere...

116
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:05,280
abandoned.

117
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,757
Wait. Wait.

118
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,869
I wish it could be different.

119
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:23,407
I have to go.

120
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,652
"Too-le."

121
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:46,456
I think it's "To-ill-uh."

122
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,217
Hell of a town.

123
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:49,697
Small is good.

124
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:51,300
Means the ranch'll be easier to find.

125
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,380
All we got to do is get that money

126
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,217
and we'll be out of here by nightfall.

127
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:57,300
Right.

128
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:16,757
FBI FIELD OFFICE

129
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,299
Oh, sir. Soil test came back
from Scofield's crash.

130
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,000
Not that you need
any more proof, but...

131
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,200
he really went out of his way
this time.

132
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,923
What else do you have?

133
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,234
A man was violently assaulted
in Nebraska

134
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:31,372
by a hitchhiker matching
Bagwell's description.

135
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:33,283
He was headed west on the I-80.

136
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,031
Omaha's putting together photo lineup.

137
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,765
What do you have on Scofield?

138
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,634
What does anybody have on Scofield?

139
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:44,189
I've got some results
from his hard drive.

140
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,100
The one recovered from the river.

141
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:50,209
We were able to use the sector editor
to restore the master boot.

142
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:52,212
- So from that...
- I don't care how you did it.

143
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,329
What do you have?

144
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,463
More than half the contents
of the buffer.

145
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,585
About 60%.

146
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:06,197
It looks pretty random.

147
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:08,192
Print it up. All of it.
I want it on my desk.

148
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:13,826
Well, guess what?

149
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,079
No listing for a Double K Ranch.

150
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:19,009
Excuse me.

151
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,052
You know where I might find
a Double K Ranch?

152
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,145
What you call it?

153
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:23,476
Double K Ranch.

154
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,790
No.

155
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,825
You from around here?

156
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:27,211
Yeah. Born and raised.

157
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,137
There's no Double-nothing.

158
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:30,660
Great. Thank you.

159
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,156
Looks like Westmoreland

160
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:36,564
spent his last breath
blowing smoke up your ass.

161
00:08:36,622 --> 00:08:38,105
There's one way to find out.

162
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,086
The county keeps property records.

163
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,284
Every plot is mapped out

164
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,365
with dimensions. It's public record.

165
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,791
But if there is
a tax assessor's office here,

166
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,810
it's gonna be in there,

167
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:52,195
the Municipal Building.

168
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,739
Lot of cops in there, Michael.

169
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:01,346
<i>Dispatch.</i>

170
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,500
<i>Someone...someone
stole my car this morning.</i>

171
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:06,654
<i>I'm at the Lotus Motel
off Interstate 80.</i>

172
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:08,433
<i>Did you see who took it?</i>

173
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,484
<i>No. I went out for a walk</i>

174
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:12,799
<i>and when I came back, it was gone.</i>

175
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,761
<i>This morning?
Why didn't you call before?</i>

176
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:16,918
<i>I... I don't know.</i>

177
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:15,900
Mr. Kellerman.

178
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:17,106
Mr. Kim.

179
00:10:19,112 --> 00:10:20,653
Surprised to see
you in Chicago.

180
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,799
Just looking for updates.

181
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,400
Sara Tancredi. I'm on it.

182
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,309
Is pursuing her
the best use of your time?

183
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:28,410
It is.

184
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,176
She's in contact
with Scofield.

185
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:31,967
I was there when
he called yesterday.

186
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:34,400
We stay with her,
she takes us right to him,

187
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:35,765
he takes us to Burrows.

188
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:38,484
All right.

189
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:40,174
If you're that confident.

190
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,230
I am.

191
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,101
I'll let the President know.

192
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,000
I contact the President directly.

193
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:49,130
I'll contact her.

194
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:52,149
Keep me posted.

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,699
<i>If you want to restore your dignity,</i>

196
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:22,152
<i>you need to take action.</i>

197
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,173
<i>Making amends requires much more
than saying "I'm sorry."</i>

198
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,382
It means learning to change.

199
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:30,836
The apology is just the first step.

200
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:34,899
The most important thing
is that you display honesty,

201
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,175
courage

202
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:37,980
and compassion

203
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,999
when you extend
your apologies.

204
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:42,337
You need to earn
your forgiveness.

205
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:45,466
We'll talk about it more on Friday.

206
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,979
I've got a great idea.

207
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,987
What's that?

208
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:04,388
Since you are such a fan

209
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:07,000
of lame, store-bought
blueberry pie,

210
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,888
I am going to bake you
a real pie of your choice

211
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:11,176
tonight.

212
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,458
I can't.

213
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:18,334
I really don't need to be seeing
anyone right now

214
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:19,567
who isn't my therapist.

215
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:24,587
I've been a hermit lately, too.

216
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,926
My partner Daniel's
away on business.

217
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:29,548
I've been sitting around
every night by myself.

218
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:31,400
Kind of pathetic.

219
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,603
I am so sorry.

220
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:36,000
I thought you meant...

221
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:39,141
I thought...

222
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:41,600
The... The pie...

223
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:43,500
No.

224
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,599
- That's my ego.
- No, I was really talking about...

225
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,608
- Pie?
- Yeah.

226
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,919
Actual blueberries.
Like we'd make pie and watch

227
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:52,421
- Fried Green Tomatoes.
- I get it,

228
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,399
I get it.

229
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,460
I'm the best ex-junkie cook
in this town.

230
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,099
Thank you. I just... I gotta
clean my apartment.

231
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,864
It's disgusting, and I realize
that sounds like an excuse,

232
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:02,717
- it's not.
- No, no, no, I get it.

233
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,265
You do what you gotta do.

234
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,472
Have a good night.

235
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:11,695
Do you deliver?

236
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:22,629
Next batch.

237
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:54,663
Just...
put it on the desk.

238
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:00,405
- Does any of this stuff mean anything?
- I don't know. Ask me later.

239
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,225
You think he's a genius or a whack-job?

240
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,303
I think we answered that question
when we assigned

241
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:05,221
100 agents to the case.

242
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,139
So why don't you go and get
me the rest of it?

243
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:08,487
Does that work for you?

244
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:42,818
Lucky day!

245
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:45,494
I just found me
an in-betweener.

246
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:49,278
Where you going
in such a hurry?

247
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,200
None of your beeswax, yo.

248
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,600
I know where.

249
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,549
Same place as every other man
who was in that room that night.

250
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,815
They all coming around here
for a big family reunion

251
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:00,529
at the Ku Klux Ranch.

252
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:02,225
If they ain't here already.

253
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:06,090
Ain't no country folk in this town
ever heard of the Double K Ranch.

254
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:07,604
Seems like you've been misinformed.

255
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:08,815
Indeed there is a Double K.

256
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:11,052
It's just a matter of who
gets there 1st, all right?

257
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:13,083
The stars are gonna collide
in Tooele, my friend.

258
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:14,918
You'll need me on your side.

259
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:17,061
This ain't Fox River, all right?

260
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:18,330
I don't need any...

261
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:22,168
As you can see...

262
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:24,952
I need you.

263
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:29,738
Get your grubby paws
off me, you freak.

264
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,717
- I ain't your ditch digger.
- I don't need...

265
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:35,702
I don't need nothing from you!
I don't need nothing!

266
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:37,661
You might...

267
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:41,640
...if a man knew where
he was supposed to be looking.

268
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,138
Are you having
the Hector Avila

269
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:01,000
and Maricruz Delgado wedding today?

270
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:02,899
Avila.

271
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,700
No? Okay, thanks.

272
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:14,361
Hi. Are you having the
Hector Avila

273
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,341
and Maricruz Delgado
wedding today?

274
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,876
Avila.

275
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,536
Delgado.

276
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:23,312
Really?

277
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,672
When?

278
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:39,199
Stay calm. We'll be out in ten minutes.

279
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:42,237
One at a time.

280
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,770
Clear.

281
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:45,658
Back up.

282
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:50,844
Are you wearing a watch?

283
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,361
Yeah.

284
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:06,857
Nice day.

285
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:10,521
Thanks.

286
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,959
This is exactly
what we need.

287
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,077
It's a map

288
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:24,875
of every parcel of land.

289
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:26,917
Topography, buildings...

290
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:28,200
everything.

291
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:34,158
Karl Kokosing. Double K.

292
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:36,292
I don't like the way
this guy is looking at us.

293
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:47,348
1213.

294
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:52,060
Where's 1213?

295
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,177
<i>Ms. Sebern, I need to speak with you.</i>

296
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:03,100
Come on, man, we got to roll now.

297
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
<i>Ms. Sebern?</i>

298
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,977
Come on. You got the map?

299
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:13,533
No.

300
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:16,568
Someone else does.

301
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Someone got here before us.
That's the only explanation.

302
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,842
Son of a bitch
is still alive.

303
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,942
Hey, pretty!

304
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,695
What are you going to do, scream?

305
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:44,384
How the hell...

306
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:46,153
you are still breathing?

307
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,434
What the hell did you do
to your hand?

308
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,886
Easy, easy...

309
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:54,599
I recently had some work done.

310
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,300
Where's the map?!

311
00:18:58,383 --> 00:19:01,219
Easy... I don't have it.

312
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,134
- Well, where is it?
- I'm telling you,

313
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:04,444
I don't have it.

314
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,538
- Don't have it, huh?
- You were there. We saw you.

315
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:09,436
It was gone
when I got there.

316
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:11,437
Now why don't you keep
your pooch away from me.

317
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:12,885
I'll tell you everything I know.

318
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,272
It's the kid. He has it.

319
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,556
I saw him this morning

320
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:21,918
and I needed some help.

321
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:23,471
We made a deal, all right?

322
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,219
He said that he would dig.

323
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:26,999
I told him where we could get a map.

324
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:29,408
What kid?

325
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,583
What kid?

326
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:48,339
The best thing
to do is nothing.

327
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,207
That's how I'm gonna get
the U. S. Senate

328
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:52,037
to confirm my Vice-Presidency,
do nothing?

329
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:53,700
Shows them you can do the job.

330
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:57,800
It's my daughter.

331
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:01,157
Sir, we need to talk
about your daughter.

332
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:02,919
What about her?

333
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,853
Well, the media is all over this
Fox River situation.

334
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:07,143
We think it would be best

335
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:09,162
if you could distance yourself
from her...

336
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,794
If I hear this one more time...

337
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:12,816
I paid her bail,
I walked away.

338
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,403
I have distanced myself.

339
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:20,400
Give me a minute.

340
00:20:23,905 --> 00:20:25,070
Hey, Dad, it's me.

341
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:27,440
When you get a chance, I really need

342
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:29,008
to talk to you about some things.

343
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:32,141
Actually a lot of things.

344
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:35,077
The most important one is that...

345
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:38,668
I owe you an apology. I...

346
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:41,772
I realize that I've made
things difficult for you lately...

347
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,721
...and I want
to take responsibility for that.

348
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,425
Call me back. Bye.

349
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:57,366
Hi. I know I'm early,
but I brought dinner.

350
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:58,485
Come on in.

351
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:00,509
- You're not a vegetarian, are you?
- No.

352
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:02,223
Just shut that behind you.

353
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:16,607
- You mind if I check my e-mail?
- No, not at all. Here.

354
00:21:16,637 --> 00:21:18,860
- You're so kind. Thank you.
- Absolutely.

355
00:21:42,054 --> 00:21:44,197
Do you happen to have a pen
handy?

356
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:45,266
Yeah.

357
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:47,981
Thank you so much.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

358
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,355
No. Look, I have a
little pencil and a pad.

359
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:51,550
Thank you.

360
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,895
Sir?

361
00:22:01,002 --> 00:22:01,775
Yeah?

362
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:03,239
There's no Sherry in Cheyenne.

363
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:05,555
Your ticket is not valid
for travel.

364
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:06,923
Oh, well, hold on now.

365
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,022
That can't be right.
That can't be right.

366
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:10,666
- Excuse me for a second.
- Sure.

367
00:22:13,094 --> 00:22:15,922
All right now, listen, brother.
I'm gonna give it to you straight.

368
00:22:16,524 --> 00:22:18,450
Listen, I'm broke, okay?

369
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,798
That's the truth.

370
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:23,687
And I just ran into some trouble
a while back and...

371
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:27,240
I'm just really trying
to pull it all together now.

372
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:28,219
You understand?

373
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:31,303
You can tell it all to the authorities
in about five minutes.

374
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,108
Oh, come on, brother.
We don't have to get the authorities...

375
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:35,357
It's too late.

376
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:37,583
They're already waiting
at the next stop.

377
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:38,872
These guys here,

378
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,347
they're gonna sit with you
until we stop.

379
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:45,385
I understand. I understand.

380
00:22:55,913 --> 00:22:57,382
Hey, you can't go in there!

381
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,386
Okay, we've got a confirmed
sighting on Franklin.

382
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:24,340
Jumped out of a moving train
in Preston, Idaho.

383
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,740
What is a black man
from Chicago doing in Idaho?

384
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,180
He's gotta be lost.

385
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:30,548
Franklin's in Preston, Idaho,

386
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,684
Bagwell's in Nebraska,

387
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:33,959
and both men have never been
across the Mississippi.

388
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:36,386
Visiting friends and family?
I don't think so.

389
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,522
And not...

390
00:23:38,153 --> 00:23:39,154
south of the border.

391
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:41,466
They're due west and we need to know...

392
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,727
why.

393
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:47,622
Out.

394
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:52,432
- What's going on, friends?
- Where was Tweener headed?

395
00:23:52,471 --> 00:23:54,994
Up on the main drag.
He was supposed to find a shovel.

396
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:03,413
- In.
- No.

397
00:24:03,537 --> 00:24:05,364
- No, no, no.
- In!

398
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,050
You're coming back, right?

399
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,302
You're coming back?!

400
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:15,893
Yep.

401
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:17,120
Hey, you guys!

402
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:22,074
Come on, man,
I'm gonna help you here!

403
00:24:33,562 --> 00:24:35,719
I was on my ATV, and I was hauling ass.

404
00:24:35,777 --> 00:24:37,973
I was right on her tail,
and I pulled out my gun

405
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,840
and blam! That bitch treed herself,

406
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:41,381
and I brought her down in one shot.

407
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,550
- What'd she weigh?
- Least a hunny.

408
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,975
Maybe one-ten.

409
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,470
Come on out and see us if you want.

410
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,159
- It's gonna be a good time.
- Yeah, I just might do that.

411
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,362
Hey, now, what you digging?

412
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,774
Some stuff in my grandpa's yard.

413
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,734
We got a bigger one in the back
if you're going deep.

414
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:10,141
No,
this will do.

415
00:25:12,353 --> 00:25:14,684
Damn it if I don't know you
from somewhere.

416
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:17,204
Maybe I know your grandpa.

417
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:20,087
I doubt it, man.
He moved here, like, a month ago, so...

418
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,839
What's his name?

419
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,740
His name's Grandpa.

420
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,182
A'ight? Look, man,
can you just ring this up?

421
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,472
I gotta get out of here.

422
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Sure thing, fella.

423
00:25:30,391 --> 00:25:31,528
I'll ring it up.

424
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:32,838
I'll ring it right now.

425
00:25:37,156 --> 00:25:39,089
I know where I seen you on the TV.

426
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,314
You're one of them Fox River boys.

427
00:26:00,884 --> 00:26:02,310
You got it wrong, man.

428
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:04,101
No, I think I got it right.

429
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,410
We're closed!

430
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,042
Sorry, bud.

431
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:21,560
Closing up early today.

432
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:25,162
Hold on.

433
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:27,129
Stay right there.

434
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,411
You're going down, just like
your buddy, you son of a bitch.

435
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,782
Where's the kid?

436
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,618
Where's the kid?!

437
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:49,425
He's back here.

438
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:50,800
Get up.

439
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:56,536
Come on, tough guy.

440
00:26:57,107 --> 00:26:58,310
Let's go.

441
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:41,328
Maricruz.
Baby, open up.

442
00:27:42,615 --> 00:27:43,636
Theresa!

443
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:46,310
It's me. It's me, okay?

444
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:49,624
Fernando, what are you doing here?

445
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:50,910
You can't be here.

446
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:52,141
I know, Theresa. I just got...

447
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:53,972
Where's your sister?
I need to see Maricruz.

448
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,167
She's getting her picture taken
with my mom and dad.

449
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:58,723
- The wedding's at 2:30.
- I need to see her now.

450
00:27:58,999 --> 00:27:59,910
You have to go.

451
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,093
She's the mother of my kid, Theresa.

452
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:03,436
Please.

453
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,659
You don't want her to marry Hector,
do you? Do you?

454
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,410
I'll go see if I can go get her.

455
00:28:13,938 --> 00:28:15,407
- Wait in here.
- Okay.

456
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:31,175
Lance, I got a question for you.

457
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:32,731
Yes?

458
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,937
You know who I am?

459
00:28:39,614 --> 00:28:42,003
I happened to see the
news last night, yes.

460
00:28:44,363 --> 00:28:47,153
Hey, I don't care. I've got
some skeletons in my closet, too.

461
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,825
One of them wears a dress.

462
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,821
Thank you.

463
00:28:52,168 --> 00:28:53,699
I appreciate your lack of judgment.

464
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:54,809
From what I can tell,

465
00:28:55,347 --> 00:28:56,570
you didn't do anything wrong,

466
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:59,364
but it's none of my business.
And you don't need to talk about it.

467
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,865
The whole thing just...

468
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,579
I never meant for it to happen.

469
00:29:09,141 --> 00:29:11,310
Okay, you do not need
to answer this question.

470
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:14,831
But were you and that guy, like...

471
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:22,165
You're right,
I don't want to talk about it.

472
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,192
- You done?
- Yeah.

473
00:29:28,368 --> 00:29:30,102
Does it worry you that he's...

474
00:29:30,908 --> 00:29:31,929
out there?

475
00:29:35,053 --> 00:29:36,170
Give me one second.

476
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:47,531
Dad.

477
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,210
Sara, hi.

478
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,409
I got your message.

479
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:52,683
Dad, please, come in.

480
00:29:56,618 --> 00:29:58,871
Lance,
this is, my father Frank.

481
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:00,710
How do you do?

482
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,110
Dad, this is my friend Lance.

483
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,410
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
I voted for you.

484
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,010
Well, thank you. I appreciate that.

485
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,109
Sara, I can take off.

486
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:09,389
No, no need.

487
00:30:10,173 --> 00:30:11,410
It'll only take a minute.

488
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,855
How about you step into my office

489
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,603
- and you make yourself at home.
- Sure.

490
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:26,110
<i>So...</i>

491
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,034
So, in my program...

492
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,881
we've been talking a lot
about making amends,

493
00:30:31,923 --> 00:30:34,312
and I've been thinking a lot about...

494
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:38,281
about some of

495
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,010
the choices I've made lately,

496
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,810
and I know that that affects you.

497
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:45,467
<i>and...</i>

498
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:49,153
<i>and I... I wanted to tell you</i>

499
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,310
that I'm sorry.

500
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:52,710
You don't have to say you're sorry.

501
00:30:53,077 --> 00:30:54,195
Yeah, I do.

502
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:56,910
And it must be hard to understand

503
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,143
why I did it.

504
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:02,382
<i>I had no idea that I was</i>

505
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:05,275
<i>putting these guys
back out on the street.</i>

506
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,869
<i>I thought I was saving the life
of an innocent man and...</i>

507
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:11,390
And I know that you didn't read
the information

508
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:14,818
I gave you on Lincoln Burrows,
but he is innocent and...

509
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:17,310
a lot of the people involved
right now are dead.

510
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:25,051
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

511
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:26,977
<i>This isn't why I called you.</i>

512
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:30,124
I'm fine...

513
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:32,932
but I'm scared.

514
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:36,907
Sara...

515
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:39,503
I'm gonna help you through this.

516
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:42,309
We're gonna get through this together.

517
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:45,495
Thank you.

518
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:46,953
I promise.

519
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:51,190
Kellerman.

520
00:31:51,217 --> 00:31:52,541
<i>We ran that trace you requested.</i>

521
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:53,505
What'd you get?

522
00:31:53,552 --> 00:31:54,809
<i>The line is disconnected.</i>

523
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:56,310
Whose was it?

524
00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:57,790
<i>Apparently, no one's.</i>

525
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,207
What does that mean?

526
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:01,471
<i>It's been out of service for 17 years.</i>

527
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:09,296
Fernando.

528
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:11,721
Where is she?

529
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,474
Calm down. Calm down.

530
00:32:14,061 --> 00:32:16,110
She's gonna come down and talk to you.

531
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,910
She's on her way down right now.

532
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,412
You and I got history.

533
00:32:23,181 --> 00:32:24,254
We're family.

534
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,165
And out of respect for that,
I'm gonna let her make her own decision.

535
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,430
I'm not leaving without her.

536
00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:29,971
That's for Maricruz to decide.

537
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:32,029
You've been filling her head
with all this crap.

538
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,447
She's a smart girl.

539
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:35,271
I personally don't think she's gonna

540
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,695
want to live her life on the run,
but we'll see.

541
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:39,039
You know, she doesn't love you.

542
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,734
I don't want to get into that right now.

543
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:42,251
You're not raising my kid.

544
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,185
<i>¿Tu me estas entendiendo?</i>

545
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,499
That don't sound good, cuz.

546
00:32:55,578 --> 00:32:56,610
Maricruz!

547
00:32:57,313 --> 00:32:59,444
- Baby! Mari! Where is she?
- You have to go.

548
00:32:59,502 --> 00:33:01,654
- Where is she?
- Please, Fernando, they're coming!

549
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:04,009
Did you tell her I was here? Did you?!

550
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:08,810
Maricruz...

551
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:41,903
Mahone.

552
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:44,305
I'll be right down.

553
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,210
Mr. Mahone.

554
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:53,780
Where are they?

555
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:55,774
Had a hard time getting
my hands on these.

556
00:33:55,832 --> 00:33:57,200
It'd be easier to go to a doctor,

557
00:33:57,257 --> 00:33:59,272
tell him you need something
to calm your nerves.

558
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:01,886
Doctors take notes.
That's why I have a deal with you.

559
00:34:01,944 --> 00:34:04,631
The way things been going,
I thought maybe our deal was over.

560
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:06,480
You don't ask me about Shales no more.

561
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:08,136
That part of our deal is over.

562
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:10,129
I no longer need an informant
on the case.

563
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:13,002
Thought that's all you cared about
was finding him.

564
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:14,925
You can't get them all.

565
00:34:14,963 --> 00:34:16,947
If you want, I can keep an ear
out on the street.

566
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:18,707
Midazolam.
1,500 milligrams every 30 days.

567
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,110
That's all I want from you.

568
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,310
We understand each other?

569
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,002
You gonna pay me for it?

570
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,347
Right there.

571
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,731
What are you doing here?

572
00:34:37,815 --> 00:34:39,143
We had to come for you, buddy.

573
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,702
How'd you know?

574
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,738
T- Bag.

575
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,830
Hand over the map.

576
00:34:44,156 --> 00:34:45,309
- What?
- The map.

577
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,616
Hand it over.

578
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,243
He told you I had it?

579
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:06,330
We are going to sort this out
right now.

580
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:14,991
Tell me that's not what I know it is.

581
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:17,279
It is.

582
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:19,667
But don't worry, before I destroyed it

583
00:35:19,848 --> 00:35:22,044
I committed it to
my photographic memory.

584
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:23,450
Coming from a compulsive liar,

585
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:24,972
I find that a little hard to believe.

586
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,805
I'da tattooed it to my body
but I didn't have the time.

587
00:35:28,491 --> 00:35:30,167
Whenever you strip search a lifer,

588
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,061
you should always check his coin purse.

589
00:35:32,817 --> 00:35:34,378
Tell us where the money is.

590
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,990
Now let's not dissolve
into threats, all right?

591
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,745
I'm going to take the high road here

592
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,709
and suggest a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

593
00:35:41,728 --> 00:35:43,462
I have the information,

594
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,177
you have the manual requirements

595
00:35:45,196 --> 00:35:48,538
necessary to unearth
Westmoreland's buried booty.

596
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:49,655
We're partners.

597
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:50,787
And why is that?

598
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:52,237
'Cause as of this moment,

599
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:53,730
I'm your map.

600
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,230
So then, yo, we split it four ways,
right?

601
00:36:03,065 --> 00:36:04,394
Wrong. Get in.

602
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,694
You're not worth 1.5.

603
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:09,177
- Get in.
- Okay.

604
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:35,700
Excuse me. Can I help you?

605
00:36:37,348 --> 00:36:39,794
Oh. Yeah.
Sorry, yeah.

606
00:36:42,897 --> 00:36:44,030
It's hot.

607
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:49,167
I was really wondering
how much you selling your RV for.

608
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,680
Probably out of your price range.

609
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,379
Come on, give me a shot.

610
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:55,272
$40,000.

611
00:37:01,874 --> 00:37:03,261
Look, I tell you what.

612
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,151
I'll be back in a couple days, okay?

613
00:37:05,814 --> 00:37:07,201
I can't hold it for you.

614
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:09,493
I said I'll be back.

615
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:11,630
With cash.

616
00:37:30,235 --> 00:37:31,430
Nice bike.

617
00:37:41,015 --> 00:37:42,729
<i>The wedding's at 2:30, Fernando.</i>

618
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:48,845
We just got confirmation
on Fernando Sucre.

619
00:37:48,884 --> 00:37:50,617
He was in Las Vegas around 2:00.

620
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:52,274
Then a gas station attendant

621
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:55,199
spotted a guy on a bike
matching his description

622
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:57,376
in Mesquite...

623
00:37:57,953 --> 00:37:58,991
an hour

624
00:37:59,589 --> 00:38:00,596
later.

625
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:03,530
Out west, just like
Bagwell and Franklin.

626
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:05,341
Yeah, but he was heading east.

627
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:07,729
And Bagwell's in Nebraska
on I-80 heading west.

628
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,614
And Franklin's train was heading west,
but he jumped off to the...

629
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:12,779
sou...

630
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,021
You know D. B. Cooper?

631
00:38:19,098 --> 00:38:20,770
- Yeah, that hijacker.
- Hijacker.

632
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:21,829
But he was never found.

633
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:24,553
Yeah, but he's got to be somewhere,
right, because someone hijacked

634
00:38:24,592 --> 00:38:27,269
that plane in Portland and jumped out
over the Pacific Northwest.

635
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:29,330
And someone was arrested two days later

636
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:31,468
in Bisbee, Arizona.

637
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:32,951
- Not the same guy.
- Same guy.

638
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:35,281
Same guy who was treated
for a broken knee

639
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,664
in a free clinic somewhere
around Salt Lake City.

640
00:38:37,703 --> 00:38:39,667
Same guy whose Nova blew a head gasket

641
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,933
ten miles short of the border.

642
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,700
Same guy who almost got away

643
00:38:42,777 --> 00:38:44,048
with a stolen car,

644
00:38:44,392 --> 00:38:46,087
but he ran a woman down in Bisbee.

645
00:38:46,164 --> 00:38:47,590
Vehicular manslaughter.

646
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,727
Arrested and booked
as Charles Westmoreland.

647
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:54,530
But he didn't have the money on him.

648
00:38:54,714 --> 00:38:55,985
Which means,

649
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,299
he got rid of it somewhere
along the way.

650
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,192
Wait, wait, this is fact?
You figured all this out?

651
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:02,744
No. Scofield did.

652
00:39:02,984 --> 00:39:04,919
That's why he was bringing
the old man along.

653
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,989
The money's in Utah.

654
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:07,612
And they're all going to get it.

655
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:13,534
<i>You know, in... Thailand</i>

656
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:15,075
they got a black market

657
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:17,120
where you can get
any kind of surgery you need,

658
00:39:17,193 --> 00:39:18,530
even a hand transplant.

659
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,515
- You're sick, you know that.
- Keep going.

660
00:39:20,543 --> 00:39:22,522
The turnoff's just up here somewhere.

661
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,187
Before or after Sheep Road?

662
00:39:26,592 --> 00:39:28,454
What's the matter,
Theodore, did you forget?

663
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:30,330
How could I forget a road called Sheep?

664
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,450
It's after.

665
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:32,904
Don't you feel all warm inside

666
00:39:32,962 --> 00:39:34,329
now that we're working together?

667
00:39:34,368 --> 00:39:35,716
We aren't working together.

668
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:37,698
You're just here to lend a hand.

669
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,110
Now, slow down.

670
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:42,106
That was it, that little bitty road
right back there.

671
00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:07,075
How far is it from here?

672
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,465
Quarter mile if I remember
the scale properly.

673
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:11,932
Start walking.

674
00:40:32,971 --> 00:40:33,982
Frank?

675
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,056
Yeah, I'm almost ready.

676
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:38,329
What time did you say the flight was?

677
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,330
8:00.

678
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:42,424
Listen, I hope you get this nomination
more than anyone, but...

679
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:43,842
be prepared.

680
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:45,630
This Burrows thing may steamroll.

681
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,783
Well, we'll wait it out,
just like you said.

682
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:49,841
Problem is too many headlines.

683
00:40:50,025 --> 00:40:52,067
His lawyer Nick Savrinn's already dead.

684
00:40:52,506 --> 00:40:54,432
His kid's awaiting trial
for double homicide.

685
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,229
and now his lead counsel
is classified as missing.

686
00:40:57,437 --> 00:40:59,301
Well, is she missing or is she dead?

687
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:03,530
I just thought you should know
before you go to Washington.

688
00:41:03,942 --> 00:41:06,430
Bruce, is there something
connecting all of this?

689
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:09,546
It's probably best you don't ask
a whole lot of questions.

690
00:41:20,383 --> 00:41:21,635
Where now?

691
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,674
Right up there.

692
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,463
The hill borders the property.

693
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,207
KK's on the other side.

694
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,447
First thing I'm gonna do
with the money?

695
00:41:33,893 --> 00:41:35,010
Buy new shoes.

696
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:36,319
Second thing: tacos.

697
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:37,173
Third thing:

698
00:41:37,673 --> 00:41:38,845
ice cold beer.

699
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:39,968
Fourth thing:

700
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:41,742
a little toothpaste.

701
00:41:43,405 --> 00:41:44,696
Oh, damn!

702
00:41:58,524 --> 00:41:59,530
Mahone.

703
00:41:59,573 --> 00:42:01,779
<i>Agent Mahone, your car's out front, sir.</i>

704
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,362
<i>The flight to Utah leaves in an hour.</i>

705
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:04,452
I'll be there.

706
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:05,734
Thank you.

707
00:42:32,236 --> 00:42:33,237
Ninth thing:

708
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:34,492
a shower.

709
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:37,118
Tenth thing: a good night's sleep.

710
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:38,884
A nice hotel.

711
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:40,098
Clean sheets.

712
00:42:40,261 --> 00:42:42,534
Look, stakes marking the property line.

713
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:44,295
Should be dead ahead.

714
00:42:45,577 --> 00:42:47,137
Can you see the silo?

715
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:55,564
The bastards built over it.

716
00:42:58,392 --> 00:42:59,644
It's gone.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
