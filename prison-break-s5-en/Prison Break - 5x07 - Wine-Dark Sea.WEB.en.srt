1
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:24,083 
It's incredible how good

2
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:24,083 
you've gotten at drawing, Mike.

3
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,708 
Really, that's...

4
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,666 
that's so good.

5
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,041 
It's a Greek hero.

6
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,791 
He looks hurt.

7
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,208 
They all get hurt

8
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,208 
sooner or later.

9
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:38,000 
That's what's great

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:38,000 
about Greek heroes,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,083 
they're real, not supermen.

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,041 
They get hurt.

13
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,291 
They can die.

14
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,916 
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy,

15
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,916 
last little bit.

16
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,958 
I got to keep it

17
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,958 
clean, you know?

18
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,625 
It's looking much

19
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,625 
better though, okay?

20
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,416 
You're doing good.

21
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,416 
You just hang in there, buddy.

22
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,625 
How we doing?

23
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,333 
Got something.

24
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,375 
Our friend over

25
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,375 
there has a boat.

26
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,250 
He's making a smuggling

27
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,250 
run to Greece.

28
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,291 
He says he can take your brother

29
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,291 
to a first world doctor.

30
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,416 
First world thinks

31
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,416 
he's Kaniel Outis.

32
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:15,958 
They'll arrest him on sight.

33
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,458 
So?

34
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,708 
What's the alternative,

35
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,708 
let him die?

36
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:19,958 
What kind of a brother are you?

37
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,041 
You say something

38
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,041 
like that again,

39
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,625 
I swear to God,

40
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,625 
I'll kill you.

41
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,333 
There might be a third option.

42
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,416 
SARA: So how was

43
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,416 
your first day back?

44
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,000 
(sighs)

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,416 
I have to say, it's

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,416 
never been so rewarding

47
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,750 
to teach game theory to the tops

48
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,208 
of a bunch of

49
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,208 
18-year-olds' heads

50
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,750 
while they're busy

51
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,750 
sexting each other.

52
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,000 
Ew.

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,291 
(laughing):

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,291 
Ew!

55
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,750 
But...

56
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,375 
normalcy's threatening

57
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,375 
to come back,

58
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,541 
and I say

59
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,541 
cheers to that.

60
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,875 
Cheers to that.

61
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,666 
(ring clinks on glass)

62
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,208 
Come on,

63
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,208 
let's sit outside.

64
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,958 
(phone ringing)

65
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,458 
I'll be right there.

66
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,333 
Hello?

67
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,458 
LINCOLN:

68
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,458 
<i>We found Michael.</i>

69
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,916 
Is he our Michael?

70
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,625 
<i>Yes, Sara.</i>

71
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,750 
(soft chuckle)

72
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,666 
<i>Sara, listen,</i>

73
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,666 
<i>he's been poisoned.</i>

74
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:29,916 
We think it's antifreeze.

75
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,166 
He's lost a lot of blood.

76
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,500 
<i>He needs a lot of blood.</i>

77
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,000 
Okay.

78
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,541 
He needs a lot of things

79
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,541 
if it's antifreeze.

80
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,791 
<i>Listen, uh,</i>

81
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,541 
we're heading to Greece.

82
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,791 
Is there any way we can get some

83
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,791 
medical help off the books?

84
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,500 
No, no, no, no, no,

85
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,500 
this isn't the kind of thing

86
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,000 
that you want to do

87
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,000 
off the books.

88
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,125 
Listen, Lincoln, he's

89
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,125 
gonna need a transfusion.

90
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,916 
Michael's B negative, okay?

91
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,958 
It's maybe one percent of the

92
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,958 
population with that blood type.

93
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,708 
You won't find it

94
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,708 
where you're going,

95
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,541 
and he won't make it

96
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,541 
while you look.

97
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,041 
Unless it comes to you.

98
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,291 
I'll call you back.

99
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,333 
Hey, what's going on?

100
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,000 
I, uh...

101
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,875 
I got to go.

102
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,916 
You got to go?

103
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,291 
(both chuckle)

104
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,291 
Go where?

105
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,541 
To Crete.

106
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,208 
Michael, um,

107
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,875 
they found him.

108
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,291 
He's alive.

109
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,541 
He's poisoned.

110
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,958 
Michael? Your ex, Michael?

111
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,208 
Yeah.

112
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,458 
Wait, hold on a second,

113
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,833 
he really is alive?

114
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,416 
He contacted you just now?

115
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,875 
Yeah, and, uh,

116
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,875 
and he needs help,

117
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:38,916 
and I think I'm the only one

118
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:38,916 
that can help him.

119
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,000 
Um...

120
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,708 
yeah, I can get there faster on

121
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,708 
a plane than they can on a boat.

122
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,333 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sara?

123
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,250 
Y-You don't owe him that.

124
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,333 
Y-You don't know what you'd be

125
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,333 
walking into; it's not safe.

126
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,708 
I'll be fine.

127
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,708 
I don't have a choice.

128
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:52,958 
(stammering):

129
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:52,958 
I...

130
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,541 
This has been a hell of a week.

131
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,125 
Okay, look, I know you've

132
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,125 
got a million questions,

133
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,041 
just like I do, okay?

134
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,583 
I can't look

135
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,583 
my son in the eye

136
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,666 
and tell him that

137
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,666 
I let his father die

138
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,958 
when I could've

139
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,958 
tried to save him.

140
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,333 
A father he's never met.

141
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,916 
I can't do that.

142
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,708 
And if I told you not to go?

143
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,166 
"If's" a big word

144
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,166 
in that sentence.

145
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,083 
Jacob, are you telling me

146
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,083 
not to go?

147
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,125 
No.

148
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,125 
No, of course not.

149
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,958 
Okay.

150
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,458 
(laughing)

151
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,875 
Should've left her

152
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,875 
out of this, Linc.

153
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,333 
Shut up. You're about to see

154
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,333 
the wife you haven't seen

155
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,875 
in seven years.

156
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,875 
I got you, I got you.

157
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,875 
JA:

158
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,875 
Cast off.

159
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,708 
You're ready.

160
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,541 
What do you mean?

161
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:01,458 
Been locked up for longer

162
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:01,458 
than I can remember.

163
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,333 
Before Ogygia, it was

164
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,333 
my apartment, my head

165
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,416 
and my phone.

166
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,916 
Walls all around me.

167
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,166 
Couldn't see the world.

168
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,750 
(children laughing and

169
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,750 
speaking foreign language)

170
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,375 
I like it here.

171
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,791 
No walls.

172
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,375 
Freedom, like I haven't

173
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,375 
had in a long time.

174
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,041 
I can start over.

175
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,083 
And unless you say you need me,

176
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,041 
I'd like to stay.

177
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,583 
You're a free man, Ja.

178
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,416 
The choice is yours.

179
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,583 
I owe you my life.

180
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,750 
You gave me back the world.

181
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,916 
Get him healthy. Get safe.

182
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,958 
Yeah, I will.

183
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,625 
See you.

184
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,583 
Hey, hey, hey.

185
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,083 
I got to know,

186
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,500 
you really got

187
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,500 
Freddie Mercury's ashes?

188
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,291 
Is it true Keith Richard

189
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,291 
snorted his dead father's ashes?

190
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,625 
I don't know.

191
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,125 
Exactly.

192
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,916 
Keep alive.

193
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,083 
You too, man.

194
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,208 
(boat engine starts)

195
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,708 
Linc,

196
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,541 
how far is it to Greece?

197
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,625 
12 hours.

198
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,250 
Sara's gonna be there in 12.

199
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,875 
I don't think I have

200
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,875 
12 hours in me.

<i>I was right, we got problems.</i>

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,083 
Apparently, State Department is

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,083 
asking questions about 21-Void

209
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,500 
after our visit

210
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,500 
to NSA yesterday.

211
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,208 
They have no

212
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,208 
viable information.

213
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,541 
21-Void doesn't exist.

00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,000 
Poseidon will clean house.

The problem's

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,166 
not going away.

217
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,375 
That State Department

218
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,375 
agent wants to meet

219
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,750 
as soon as we land.

220
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,833 
Chania, please?

221
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,125 
Thank you.

226
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,541 
You got any food for him?

227
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,791 
Come, it's in the boat.

228
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,375 
Great, thank you.

229
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,083 
Keep his spirits up.

230
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,958 
All right, man.

231
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,291 
Oh, man.

232
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,750 
Got to hang in there,

233
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,750 
buddy, huh?

234
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,416 
Still got a lot of things

235
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,416 
to tell me, you know?

236
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,458 
You gonna tell me why

237
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,458 
I'm your whip hand.

238
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,458 
Remember?

239
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,500 
I got a lot invested in you.

240
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,083 
You can't die on me now,

241
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,083 
Michael, you know?

242
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,416 
Called you Michael.

243
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,416 
(chuckles softly)

244
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:42,041 
The first-- first time I ever

245
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:42,041 
really known your name,

246
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,458 
even though I feel like...

247
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,125 
I feel like we've been brothers

248
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,125 
since we met, you know?

249
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,125 
You know, with--

250
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,125 
with Linc here...

251
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,958 
(sighs)

252
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,958 
...it was the first time I ever

253
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,958 
felt like an outsider with you.

254
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,208 
You know, like--

255
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,041 
like I lost...

256
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,958 
part of my family

257
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,958 
or something.

258
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,916 
So, you see, Michael,

259
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,916 
you can't die.

260
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,333 
Please?

261
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,958 
(motor whirring)

262
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,708

267
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,375 
Hi.

268
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,500 
I missed you.

269
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,708 
I'm gonna fix you up.

270
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,708 
And then

271
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,708 
we'll talk, okay?

272
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,416 
I'm gonna make you okay.

273
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,541 
(gasps)

274
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,541 
No.

275
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,625 
Shh, shh, shh,

276
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,750 
shh, shh, shh,

277
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,750 
it's okay.

278
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,125 
Hey, Lincoln, uh,

279
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,125 
would you pass me

280
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,125 
that coat rack?

281
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,166 
Could I grab the chair, please?

282
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,166 
Yeah.

283
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,875 
(zipper opens)

284
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,291 
Thanks.

285
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,375 
(gasps)

286
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,083 
(breathing shakily)

287
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,166 
We'll do a transfusion.

288
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,000 
I'm O negative.

289
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,625 
It's the universal donor.

290
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,500 
Turns out it's the only other

291
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,500 
blood type I could've given him.

292
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,125 
(sighs)

293
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,166 
Maybe there's something

294
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,166 
to destiny, huh?

295
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,166 
(quiet, rasping breaths)

296
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,291 
Is he gonna live?

297
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,958 
Yeah.

298
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,958 
(sniffs)

299
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,291 
Yeah, he'll live.

300
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,916 
Give him

301
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,916 
a couple hours.

302
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,375 
He's strong.

303
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,375 
(laughs)

304
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,625 
(sniffles)

305
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,875 
We'll, uh... we'll

306
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,875 
give you a minute.

307
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,791 
Yeah.

308
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,000 
I'm right here.

309
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,625 
I'm right here.

310
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,250 
We need to work out a way

311
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,250 
to get off this island.

312
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,666 
What I said...

313
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:50,375 
um, about you--

314
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,541 
I was wrong.

315
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,958 
A man would be lucky

316
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,958 
to have a brother

317
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,833 
cares as much

318
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,833 
as you, you know?

319
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,625 
Wife like that...

320
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,541 
...family.

321
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,833 
I wouldn't call it luck.

322
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,541 
You've been through

323
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,541 
what we've been through.

324
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,250 
You're family now.

325
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,333 
I'll drink to that.

326
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,791 
Yeah.

327
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,166 
(groans)

328
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,750 
Flying's really

329
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,750 
out of the question?

330
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,958 
Yeah.

331
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,875 
Airports are worse

332
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,875 
than hospitals.

333
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,875 
And once the name Kaniel Outis

334
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,875 
is radioactive,

335
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,833 
they'll shoot him on sight.

336
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,625 
So another boat?

337
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,666 
(clears throat)

338
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,666 
Across the Atlantic?

339
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:48,875 
Mm, I'm no sailor, but I know

340
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:48,875 
that no boat in that harbor

341
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,333 
is gonna get us that far.

342
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,750 
We need a big boat.

343
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,875 
One that doesn't mind a

344
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,875 
radioactive cargo, you know?

345
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:17,125 
KISHIDA: Hey there. I wanted to

346
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:17,125 
follow up on our conversation.

347
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,916 
Obviously, the CIA and State,

348
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,875 
we've been sharing

349
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,875 
information on Kaniel Outis,

350
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,083 
but my question for you is:

351
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,833 
Outis killed Abu Ramal,

352
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,208 
did the country

353
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,208 
a service.

354
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,833 
So why were you

355
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,833 
still at NSA yesterday,

356
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,916 
trying to kill him?

357
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,958 
Why don't we get

358
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,958 
off the tarmac?

359
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,083 
We'll share what we can

360
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,083 
about our investigation.

361
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,375 
This is all just

362
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,375 
bureaucratic miscommunication.

363
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,625 
We can iron it out.

364
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,000 
So you know, we

365
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,000 
checked with CIA.

366
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,291 
The CIA didn't sanction

367
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,291 
your visit to NSA yesterday.

368
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,083 
No one even knew

369
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,083 
you were there.

370
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,666 
Who are you working

371
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,666 
for, really?

372
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,958 
And why were you trying to

373
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,958 
take out Kaniel Outis?

374
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,208 
Never thought

375
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,208 
I'd see this face again.

376
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,541 
You weren't supposed to.

377
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,000 
Why?

378
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,500 
I'll tell you everything

379
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,500 
you want to know.

380
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,958 
But first,

381
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,958 
I need something from you.

382
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,708 
Anything.

383
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,250 
A picture of my son.

384
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,166 
AW: <i>We weren't</i>

385
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,166 
<i>at NSA yesterday.</i>

386
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,208 
I'm telling you,

387
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,208 
this is a mistake.

388
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,291 
And it's a mistake

389
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,291 
to lie to me.

390
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,083 
I can have you

391
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,083 
prosecuted.

392
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:41,041 
I have a contact at the NSA

393
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:41,041 
and she gave me proof.

394
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,750 
You're not calling

395
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,750 
him Junior, are you?

396
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,750 
(laughs) I promised you

397
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,750 
I would never do that.

398
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,708 
He's an amazing kid.

399
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,291 
He's just like you.

400
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,916 
What's wrong?

401
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,041 
(shell casing tinkles on floor)

402
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,583 
It's him.

403
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,583 
Your husband.

404
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,708 
Jacob?

405
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,833 
Jacob.

406
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,416 
Jacob is Poseidon.

407
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,708 
I knew it. I wasn't crazy.

408
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,208 
I caught him lying, but he-he--

409
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,875 
oh, God, he covered it so well.

410
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,875 
He was... honest and hurt,

411
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,541 
and I bought it.

412
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,958 
Who is he?

413
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,791 
Really?

414
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,291 
He's a CIA operative,

415
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,291 
deep cover.

416
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,541 
He runs a splinter

417
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,541 
cell called 21-Void.

418
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,916 
What does this have to do

419
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,916 
with you?

420
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,541 
He targeted me

421
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,541 
for my skills,

422
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,208 
blackmailed me.

423
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,583 
He told me if I didn't agree

424
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,583 
to come work for him,

425
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,416 
he'd go after you and Linc,

426
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,916 
put you both in jail.

427
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,750 
And then he

428
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,750 
proved it to me.

429
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,583 
He said I could never see

430
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,583 
either one of you again.

431
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,291 
Or Mike.

432
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,333 
Made me fake my death.

433
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,916 
And then he just used me.

434
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,541 
He married me.

435
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,291 
If I'd known he was your

436
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,291 
husband, I swear...

437
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,416 
No, no, no, no, no,

438
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,458 
this is not on you.

439
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,375 
I...

440
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,625 
Why now?

441
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,625 
Why did you come back now?

442
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,625 
The origami...

443
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,250 
Four years ago,

444
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,250 
he betrayed me

445
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,000 
and now I know why.

446
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,416 
He wanted me out

447
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,416 
of the way...

448
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,041 
so he could have you.

449
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,541 
How did he betray you?

450
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,833 
He set a meeting.

451
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,750 
We were supposed to discuss

452
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,750 
my next assignment.

453
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,458 
<i>What he didn't tell me was that</i>

454
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,833 
<i>we were meeting a man</i>

455
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,833 
<i>named Harlan Gaines,</i>

456
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,875 
<i>a deputy director of the CIA.</i>

457
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,083 
<i>Gaines was investigating</i>

458
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,083 
<i>21-Void.</i>

459
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,333 
<i>Looking for the traitor</i>

460
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,333 
<i>behind it.</i>

461
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:27,458 
<i>That's when I knew my work</i>

462
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:27,458 
<i>wasn't sanctioned by the CIA.</i>

463
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,625 
<i>Poseidon shot and killed Gaines</i>

464
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,625 
<i>that night,</i>

465
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,500 
<i>to stop the investigation.</i>

466
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,750 
<i>He told me to move the body,</i>

467
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,083 
<i>make it look like</i>

468
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,083 
<i>it never happened.</i>

469
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,416 
I've seen the photos

470
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,416 
of that murder, they're damning.

471
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,166 
MICHAEL: <i>He chose images that</i>

472
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,166 
<i>showed me moving Gaines' body,</i>

473
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,250 
<i>eliminated the ones</i>

474
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,250 
<i>that incriminated himself.</i>

475
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,416 
<i>I knew I was being set up.</i>

476
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,333 
<i>He was tightening his control</i>

477
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,333 
<i>over me,</i>

478
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,750 
<i>but there was nothing</i>

479
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,750 
<i>I could do.</i>

480
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,708 
<i>At least,</i>

481
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,708 
<i>that's what he thought.</i>

482
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,500 
<i>When I knew</i>

483
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,500 
<i>Poseidon had gone rogue</i>

484
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,958 
<i>and was operating</i>

485
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,958 
<i>outside the CIA,</i>

486
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,458 
<i>that's when I started my plan</i>

487
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,458 
<i>to get back to you.</i>

488
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,125 
You're not.

489
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,708 
Some other man has your--

490
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,541 
your face, your past,

491
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,541 
your whole life.

492
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,291 
Sara, there is a plan

493
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,291 
to make this right,

494
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,875 
to protect our family.

495
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,916 
Michael, he's with our son

496
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,916 
right now.

497
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:27,208 
He's with Mike.

498
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,958 
I, uh, look, I have to go.

499
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,916 
Ah.

500
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,708 
Hey, Noah, you gonna

501
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,708 
build us a boat?

502
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:39,500 
Nope. I'm gonna do one better.

503
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,916 
Who you calling?

504
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,250 
A friend who

505
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,250 
actually has a boat.

506
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,625 
(cell phone ringing)

507
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,333 
Hello?

508
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,625 
Sucre, it's me.

509
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,541 
Linc?

510
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,541 
I thought the Middle East

511
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,916 
was gonna swallow you up, man.

512
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,708 
Where's Michael?

513
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,708 
Did you find him?

514
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,833 
Listen, that's why I'm calling.

515
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,541 
We're on the island of Crete.

516
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,416 
We need a low profile ride

517
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,416 
back to the States.

518
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,125 
I would love to help,

519
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,916 
but we're on the other side

520
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,916 
of the world, brother.

521
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,666 
We just dropped a load

522
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,666 
in Morocco.

523
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,083 
What are you talking about?

524
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,083 
Morocco's near Crete.

525
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,041 
(laughing):

526
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,041 
Yeah, I know, of course it is,

527
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,166 
but what I mean is

528
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,166 
it's not my ship.

529
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,000 
Yeah, but what would it

530
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,000 
cost to hitch a ride?

531
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,708 
<i>You can't hitch a ride.</i>

532
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,541 
<i>You have to rent</i>

533
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,541 
<i>the whole ship.</i>

534
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,958 
<i>The boss charges 50K a leg,</i>

535
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,958 
<i>Linc.</i>

536
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,125 
You want to get back

537
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,125 
to the States, it's 50K.

538
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,375 
50K?

539
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,666 
We're just trying

540
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,666 
to get home.

541
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,541 
You know we don't have

542
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,541 
that kind of cash.

543
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,541 
You do now.

544
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,500 
Here, this was

545
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,500 
my grandmother's.

546
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,666 
It's an heirloom

547
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,666 
worth at least that.

548
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,291 
I can't think

549
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,291 
of a better use for it.

550
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,250 
Thank you.

551
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,291 
<i>We got it, Sucre.</i>

552
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,291 
<i>Get to Crete.</i>

553
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,125 
MICHAEL:

554
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,125 
He's not gonna hurt Mike,

555
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,166 
not unless he suspects

556
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,166 
you know who he really is.

557
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,625 
If you remove his mask,

558
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,333 
he'll lash out.

559
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,166 
You know him

560
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,166 
better than I do.

561
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,875 
That's the point,

562
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,875 
no one knows him.

563
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,708 
So, what do I do?

564
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,333 
You play his game.

565
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,333 
You wear your own mask.

566
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,291 
As soon as you get a chance

567
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,291 
to get away with Mike,

568
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:23,000 
you take it, disappear.

569
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,166 
I'll get to the States

570
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,166 
as soon as I can.

571
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,833 
I'll find you.

572
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,625 
You're looking better.

573
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,541 
A little grayer, but better.

574
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,375 
I have an amazing doctor

575
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,375 
on call.

576
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,291 
(sighs)

577
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,291 
I will wear the mask.

578
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,833 
I will play his game...

579
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:50,375 
and if he hurts our son,

580
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:50,375 
I'll kill him.

581
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,791 
I can't...

582
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,500 
Please come back to us.

583
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,375 
JACOB:

584
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,375 
<i>She's leaving Crete alone,</i>

585
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,625 
which means she left Outis

586
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,625 
behind, and he'll try to follow,

587
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,750 
return to the U.S.

588
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,750 
in the next day or two.

589
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,500 
<i>It can only be by ship</i>

590
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,500 
<i>or plane, so plaster his face</i>

591
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,291 
<i>on all maritime</i>

592
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,291 
<i>and air channels,</i>

593
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,291 
<i>focusing on all vessels</i>

594
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,291 
<i>departing from Crete</i>

595
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,333 
<i>in the next 48 hours.</i>

596
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,208 
He's got to be on one.

597
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,333 
He can't make it back

598
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,333 
inside the country.

599
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,333 
MIKE: Jacob?

600
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,291 
Was that Mommy?

601
00:23:56,833 --> 00:24:00,958 
Yes. Mommy's on her way home.

602
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,500 
SUCRE:

603
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,500 
Michael Scofield.

604
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,875 
(laughs)

605
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,458 
My man, you got more lives

606
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,458 
than anyone.

607
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,750 
(laughs)

608
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,208 
Think I might've

609
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,208 
used them all up.

610
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,791 
SUCRE:

611
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,791 
A damn phoenix.

612
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,416 
I can't believe it.

613
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,041 
I want to hear every damn thing

614
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,833 
that's happened to you

615
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,833 
since you died.

616
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,416 
<i>Papi, </i>you're alive?

617
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:33,625 
(laughs)

618
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,166 
The skipper

619
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,166 
is a corrupt bastard.

620
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,750 
Don't mess with him.

621
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,750 
He's got guns in the hold,

622
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,541 
all kinds of contraband.

623
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,541 
Captain.

624
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,833 
SUCRE: Here's the cargo

625
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,833 
I was telling you about.

626
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,666 
CAPTAIN:

627
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,666 
Pay up.

628
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:47,875 
Where's the 50K?

629
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,625 
Here.

630
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:52,541 
I said cash.

631
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,875 
MICHAEL: It's a sapphire,

632
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,875 
six carats,

633
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:58,500 
flawless, surrounded by

634
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:58,500 
2,5 carats of bezeled diamonds.

635
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500 
Street value is 125K.

636
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,708 
You can pawn it for half that

637
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,708 
and still make a profit.

638
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,291 
CAPTAIN:

639
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,291 
If it's fake,

640
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,708 
you go under the sea.

641
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:22,333 
A boat is the last place I

642
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:22,333 
expected to find you, buddy.

643
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,916 
I thought you

644
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,916 
hated the water.

645
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:27,166 
Yeah, you remember,

646
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:27,166 
but I got a record.

647
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,833 
Not a lot of employers lined up

648
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,833 
to take a chance on me.

649
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:32,250 
Besides, this ship

650
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:32,250 
provides opportunities

651
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,000 
for my side business...

652
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,041 
(whispering): ...which is the

653
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,041 
real reason I'm on this boat.

654
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,958 
This baby...

655
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,958 
(knocks on container)

656
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:40,166 
...houses my entire

657
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:40,166 
life savings.

658
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:42,541 
I'm telling you,

659
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:42,541 
it's gonna be huge.

660
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,208 
I'm a few months away from

661
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,208 
putting all this behind me.

662
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,500 
If you guys are lucky,

663
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,500 
I'll let you guys

664
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,833 
take one of my ladies

665
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,833 
for a spin.

666
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,666 
Huh?

667
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,750 
What, sex dolls?

668
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,041 
No, have some class, man.

669
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,791 
The term is inflatables,

670
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,791 
high quality,

671
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,375 
expensive, very lifelike.

672
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:06,041 
Huh?

673
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,833 
Hey, honey.

674
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,833 
Hey, you.

675
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,583 
Mm.

676
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,583 
Mm.

677
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,166 
Where's Mike?

678
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,625 
Asleep.

679
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,666 
Kid had a big day.

680
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:49,250 
Oh.

681
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,458 
Most important, though,

682
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,041 
how's Michael?

683
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:55,208 
Were you able to help him?

684
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:59,625 
I mean, he was barely alive

685
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:59,625 
when I got there.

686
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:03,375 
He, uh, slept most of the time.

687
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,333 
I-I did what I could

688
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,333 
for him. I, uh...

689
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:09,291 
I stabilized him,

690
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:09,291 
but he's changed.

691
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:13,625 
He, uh... he's just

692
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:13,625 
not the guy I knew.

693
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,458 
Hmm.

694
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,458 
So, they dropped me at the

695
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,458 
airport and that was that.

696
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,541 
They?

697
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,541 
Linc and some other guy.

698
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:30,208 
Mike?

699
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,416 
Where's Mike?

700
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,166 
You said that

701
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,166 
he was asleep.

702
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,166 
He is...

703
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,666 
at a friend's house,

704
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,666 
a sleepover.

705
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:41,458 
(laughing):

706
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:41,458 
Okay. Which friend?

707
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:42,666 
He's at Patrick's house.

708
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,458 
What happened

709
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,458 
to your grandmother's ring?

710
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:52,166 
I'm such an idiot.

711
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,000 
I took it off on the way over

712
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,000 
for safekeeping,

713
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,041 
'cause I didn't want it

714
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,041 
to get stolen,

715
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,625 
then when I looked for it

716
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,625 
on the way back it was gone.

717
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:03,416 
Screamed so loud they nearly

718
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:03,416 
threw me off the flight.

719
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:06,250 
Hmm.

720
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,625 
(fax machine whirring)

721
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,291 
(phone ringing)

722
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,791 
JACOB:

723
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,791 
<i>Yeah?</i>

724
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:37,291 
VAN GOGH: <i>We spoke to our man</i>

725
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:37,291 
<i>at the Pentagon.</i>

726
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:38,875 
<i>A naval alert just went out.</i>

727
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:41,041 
Kaniel Outis has been located

728
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:43,625 
on a cargo ship

729
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:43,625 
in the Mediterranean.

730
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,625 
<i>It was reported</i>

731
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,625 
<i>by the ship's captain.</i>

732
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,250 
What's the navy

733
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,250 
gonna do about it?

734
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,333 
<i>The nearest LCS combat craft</i>

735
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,208 
is moving to engage.

736
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,750 
SEAL team's been deployed.

737
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,416 
Orders?

738
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:57,833 
To seek and destroy

739
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:57,833 
Kaniel Outis.

740
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,333 
<i>Good.</i>

741
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,083 
We've done our job

742
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,083 
getting the message out.

743
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:04,083 
Now it's time for the SEALs

744
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:04,083 
to do theirs.

745
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,791 
My God.

746
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,166 
You've been through hell,

747
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,166 
my friend.

748
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,208 
Have some faith, <i>papi.</i>

749
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,583 
Thanks, <i>papi.</i>

750
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,125 
What about you, Linc?

751
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,666 
I think Linc's got

752
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,666 
a secret girlfriend,

753
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,666 
the pilot lady.

754
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,125 
She's not my lady.

755
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,583 
Maybe Sucre will set you up

756
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,583 
with one of his sex dolls.

757
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,916 
They're not dolls, man.

758
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,541 
Oh, sorry, inflatables.

759
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,291 
Look, let's just

760
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,291 
change the subject, please.

761
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:37,000 
You know, might be something

762
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:37,000 
to be said for settling down.

763
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,416 
Right, well...

764
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,416 
that's not in the cards.

765
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,416 
(door clangs)

766
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,791 
It's locked from the outside.

767
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:49,916 
They made you.

768
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,958 
You really are

769
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,958 
a wanted terrorist.

770
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,125 
What did the hell

771
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,125 
did you think he was saying?

772
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,083 
I thought it was an analogy.

773
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,375 
Oh, for God's sake.

774
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,750 
LINCOLN:

775
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,750 
There's no other way

776
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,791 
out of this cabin.

777
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:02,750 
(helicopter whirring)

778
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,416 
MAN: <i>All crew to the top deck.</i>

779
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,416 
<i>All hands up.</i>

00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:09,958 
<i>Comply or be fired on.</i>

781
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:13,750 
<i>This ship is now under</i>

782
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:13,750 
<i>the control of the U.S. Navy.</i>

783
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,708 
<i>Prepared to be boarded.</i>

784
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,375 
SUCRE:

785
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,375 
We got company.

786
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,625 
I say we jump.

787
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,833 
That's a long way down.

788
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,041 
It's the only way out.

789
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,041 
It's too far.

790
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,458 
I have an idea...

791
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:27,000 
...but it's gonna hurt.

792
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,333 
(ringing)

793
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,416 
Hello?

794
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:49,250 
(whispering): Hey, Heather,

795
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:49,250 
it's me. Listen, I can't talk,

796
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,458 
but I need you to go pick up

797
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,458 
Mike right now, okay?

798
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,875 
<i>Do you know where</i>

799
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,875 
<i>Patrick Monroe lives?</i>

800
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:53,875 
Yeah.

801
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,083 
<i>Okay.</i>

802
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,583 
Listen, I'll explain later.

803
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,541 
Don't bring him back here, okay?

804
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:00,625 
Keep him with you.

805
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:00,625 
I'll be over as soon as I can.

806
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,041 
Can you do that for me?

807
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,208 
Uh, yeah.

808
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,208 
Uh, I'll leave right now.

809
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,625 
I-I-Is everything okay?

810
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,541 
No.

811
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,083 
(grunting)

812
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,291 
Go.

813
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,666 
(whispering):

814
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,666 
Six. The rest with me.

815
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,333 
Two more. Go.

816
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,625 
(whispering indistinctly)

817
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,250 
(whispering):

818
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,250 
One, two, three, four.

819
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,083 
Go, go.

820
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:45,750 
(muttering indistinctly)

821
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,666 
I'll go left, you right.

822
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,208 
(muffled scream)

823
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:56,375 
(muffled shouting)

824
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,458 
They went out the window!

825
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,750 
They went out the window!

826
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,041 
What do you see?

827
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,541 
No visual.

828
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:03,916 
(Sucre groaning loudly)

829
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:06,916 
Alpha One,

830
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:06,916 
Alpha Two to portside, now.

831
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:09,291 
Copy that.

832
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:12,750 
(muffled):

833
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:12,750 
Okay!

834
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,458 
Take... Take it off!

835
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,500 
What's your name?

836
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,291 
Fernando.

837
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:19,958 
Fernando Sucre.

838
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:22,083 
I'm a member of this crew.

839
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:22,083 
Check the roster, man.

840
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:24,000 
I got no part in any of this.

841
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,666 
Check the roster

842
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,666 
for Fernando Sucre.

843
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,958 
MAN (over radio):

844
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,958 
<i>Suspect seems to check out.</i>

845
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:33,416 
Take him to the bridge.

846
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:35,083 
Yes, sir.

847
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,375 
Let's move.

848
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,958 
Absolutely no one gets off

849
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,958 
this ship, understand?

850
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,166 
Sir.

851
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,666 
I don't know any Kaniel Outis.

852
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:02,958 
The guy's name is Scofield.

853
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,291 
Haven't seen him in years.

854
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:06,291 
He calls me,

855
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:06,291 
he says he needs a ride.

856
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:09,208

00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,416 
Watch him.

859
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:12,958 
The guy's name is Scofield!

(machinery whirring)

861
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,125 
That's the door

862
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,125 
Sucre told us about.

863
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,500 
There they are!

864
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,083 
Freeze! Freeze!

865
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,666 
Look alive, look alive!

866
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:28,791 
We've got them bottled up.

867
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:31,583 
LINCOLN:

868
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:31,583

Come on!

00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,250

00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:56,083 
it's gonna ruin my cargo!

880
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,291 
You've always been

881
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,291 
a loser, Sucre.

882
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,708 
Worst shipmate I ever hired.

883
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,375 
You brought this scum

884
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,375 
on board my ship.

885
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,166

Where are they going?

887
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,291 
They're associates

888
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,291 
of associates.

889
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:09,166 
I haven't seen them in years.

890
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,583 
But that's a good point.

891
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:13,125 
Why don't you tell

892
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:13,125 
the nice SEAL here

893
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:15,125 
how you accepted payment

896
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,833 
Maybe they're

00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,833 
your friends, not mine.

898
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:25,083

899
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:25,083 
Okay, okay.

900
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,500 
I heard them say something

901
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,500 
about container 17.

902
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,583 
Oh.

904

906
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,250

911
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:51,166 
Vincent.

912
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,750 
You might just end up on

913
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,750 
the terrorist watch list, too.

914
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,750

JACOB: Do you remember

940
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,916 
our honeymoon?

941
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,500 
Yeah, of course.

942
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500 
How you opened up.

943
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,291 
Told me you carried shame

944
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,291 
for what you did at Fox River.

945

00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,083 
Even admitted

949
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,083 
to lying,

950
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:41,166

00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:41,166 
all from me.

952
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,625 
How you finally came clean

953
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,416 
and put it all behind you?

954
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,041 
Sure.

955
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,208 
I forgave you for the lies.

Your past.

957

00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:13,791 
Good sleepover?

1050
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:14,833 
Yeah.

1051
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,458 
Is Mommy coming to pick me up?

1052
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,875 
Yes, sir.

1053
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:23,541 
JACOB:

1054
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:23,541 
<i>Michael's dead.</i>

1055
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:26,583 
<i>Your Nightingale trip to Greece</i>

1056
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:26,583

(gasps)

1058
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:31,666 
<i>So... it's all on you, Sara.</i>

1059
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:34,958 
And your plan with Heather

1060
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:34,958 
didn't work.

1061
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:37,208 
Where's my son?

1062
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:37,208 
(gun clicks)

1063
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,166 
I have him.

1064
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,250 
And whether or not I

1065
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,250 
have to threaten him,

1066
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,166 
which I don't want to do,

1067
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,708 
is entirely contingent

1068
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,708 
upon you putting the gun down.
