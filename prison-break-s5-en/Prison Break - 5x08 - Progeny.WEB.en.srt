1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:10,000 
WHIP: Hey!

2
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:10,000 
(whistle blowing)

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,750 
Hey!

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,083 
Hey!

5
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,083 
Hey, yo,

6
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,916 
where we headed?

7
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,250 
Marseille.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,958 
WHIP: Marseilles.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,958 
Marseilles.

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,875 
JACOB:

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,875 
I own you, Scofield.

12
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,083 
I know everything about you.

13
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,500 
Even your most mundane actions,

14
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,500 
like the zoo.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,916 
What's with you and the zoo?

16
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,166 
MICHAEL:

17
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,166 
I go there to think.

18
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,125 
JACOB:

19
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,125 
18 times in the past month?

20
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,250 
A lot of thinking.

21
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,250 
I was figuring out how to get

22
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,166 
your guy out

23
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,166 
of Barranquilla.

24
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,166 
Hmm.

25
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,083 
Turns out he's not just

26
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,083 
a rebel leader--

27
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,041 
he's a murderous sociopath.

28
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,458 
That's the only way

29
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,458 
to make omelets.

30
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,458 
I need to know more

31
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,458 
about our targets.

32
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,750 
If I'm facilitating escapes,

33
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,750 
we can't have surprises.

34
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,166 
Be proud. You and me,

35
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,166 
we're changing the world.

36
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,166 
Doesn't make it right.

37
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,583 
Don't act like you're suddenly

38
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,583 
a fan of the status quo, okay?

39
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:23,208 
The system, it's slow,

40
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:23,208 
stupid, and doomed to fail.

41
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,541 
That's why you had to bust your

42
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,541 
brother out in the first place.

43
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,458 
New ink since the

44
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,458 
last time I saw you.

45
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,083 
Working on a new plan?

46
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,083 
No. No new plan.

47
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,416 
Just get tired of looking

48
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,416 
at empty skin.

49
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,666 
Uh-huh.

50
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,500 
You know, it was those tats

51
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,500 
at Fox River

52
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,958 
that caught my eye

53
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,958 
in the first place.

54
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,041 
I had to know everything

55
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,041 
about the man

56
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,958 
who wore his plans

57
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,958 
on his skin.

58
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:48,750 
In plain sight

59
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:48,750 
yet so mysterious.

60
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,583 
The key to real power

61
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,583 
is to disappear.

62
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,166 
Hi, Professor Ness.

63
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,166 
Hello, Claudia.

64
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,583 
Yeah, the secret to real power

65
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,916 
is to never betray

66
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,916 
your intentions,

67
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:02,166 
to wear nothing

68
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:02,166 
on your sleeve.

69
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,666 
And to never

70
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,666 
let anyone

71
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,250 
see your face.

72
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,666 
(trilling)

73
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,875 
(click)

74
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,750 
Come on in.

75
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,666 
Next time I'm sitting

76
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,666 
in solitary,

77
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,791 
I'll think of you in here,

78
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,791 
running the world

79
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,625 
in air-conditioned comfort.

80
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,250 
JACOB: I've spent my

81
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,250 
time in the field.

82
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,000 
You all set for Myanmar?

83
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,416 
It's only a few weeks off.

84
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,666 
That's why I'm here.

85
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,500 
I want to bring

86
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,500 
someone on board.

87
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,208 
Oh, really?

88
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,208 
The prison camp at Sittwe

89
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,208 
is a two-man job.

90
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,416 
I've been watching this guy.

91
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,416 
He'll be useful.

92
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,125 
Watching him? You in charge

93
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,333 
of recruiting now?

94
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,333 
Trust me.

95
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,750 
The last thing I was to do

96
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,750 
is suck someone else into this.

97
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,416 
He'll have my back

98
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,416 
and he'll speed things up,

99
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,416 
increase our odds.

100
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,875 
(sighs)

101
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,208 
Not exactly

102
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,208 
a distinguished career.

103
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,208 
He's held up well in prison.

104
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,208 
He's got a mean streak.

105
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,416 
And he grew up without a family.

106
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,750 
It means he can be manipulated.

107
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,750 
If you're planning

108
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,750 
something,

109
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,500 
I'll always be

110
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,500 
a step ahead of you.

111
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,916 
You know that.

112
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,958 
I can see everything

113
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,958 
in your eyes.

114
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,791 
It's what's behind the eyes

115
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,791 
that counts,

116
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,083 
Professor.

117
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,333 
Hmm.

118
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,708 
So you're gonna

119
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,708 
wait a year

120
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,708 
for me to find my

121
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,708 
way out of Sittwe?

122
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,375 
Or are you gonna

123
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,375 
get me a partner,

124
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,250 
so we get on with the business

125
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,250 
of changing the world?

126
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,166 
Done.

127
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,375 
(gulls calling)

128
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,000 
I need some food.

129
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,416 
(phone chimes)

130
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,416 
I'm with you.

131
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,833 
Linc, it's Sara.

132
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,416 
She's back in New York.

133
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,833 
LINCOLN:

134
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,833 
Are she and Mike okay?

135
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,041 
That's what I'm trying

136
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,041 
to find out.

137
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,125 
What is it, Michael?

138
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,083 
Something's wrong.

139
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,875 
Yes, you will.

140
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,291 
(muffled shouting)

141
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,541 
♪ ♪

142
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,000 
I got to get back

143
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,000 
to the States.

144
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,000 
Slow down.

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500 
You're Kaniel

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500 
Outis, remember?

147
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,166 
You're on every no-fly

148
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,166 
list in the world.

149
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,166 
Jacob's done something to Sara.

150
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,166 
Maybe Mike, too.

151
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,833
{\an8}How do you know?

152
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,833 
That text.

153
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,833 
She referred to our son

154
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,833 
as Junior.

155
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,666 
We agreed we'd

156
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,666 
never call him that.

157
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,666 
He's baiting

158
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,666 
you, Michael.

159
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,000 
It worked.

160
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,458 
(birds chirping)

161
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,208 
Hey, buddy.

162
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,625 
Where's Mom?

163
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,708 
Oh. I, uh,

164
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,708 
dropped her off at work

165
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,791 
while you were at school.

166
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,458 
That is quite

167
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,458 
a pirate ship.

168
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,708 
Although it would be

169
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,708 
a little hard

170
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,708 
to sail with the mast

171
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,708 
that far forward.

172
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,041 
Your ship might tip over.

173
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,041 
The mast has

174
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,833 
to be there.

175
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,833 
It's not just a ship--

176
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,083 
it's a treasure map.

177
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,625 
(chuckles)

178
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,625 
What do you mean?

179
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,625 
It's for Jimmy.

180
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,625 
We hide Legos for each other.

181
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,291 
I always find his.

182
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,208 
He doesn't always find mine.

183
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,416 
Wait a second,

184
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,958 
how is this drawing a map?

185
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,291 
This is the park.

186
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,708 
That's the

187
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,708 
playground.

188
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,041 
And this is the sidewalk.

189
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,208 
Impressive.

190
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,750 
You put a code

191
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,750 
in the drawing.

192
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,708 
So, okay,

193
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,708 
where did you hide the Legos?

194
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,458 
These cannons

195
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,458 
are pools at the park.

196
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,125 
But there's an extra one,

197
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,125 
in the sand.

198
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,375 
That's where I buried

199
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,375 
the Legos.

200
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,541 
Well done, Mike.

201
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,541 
Well done.

202
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,708 
I've tried everyone. I'm out

203
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,708 
of resources in the States.

204
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,000 
All my contacts. People who

205
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,000 
can go and check on them,

206
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,416 
make sure they're okay.

207
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,041 
Linc, I got to get home.

208
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,458 
I can't spend another two weeks

209
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,458 
on a cargo ship.

210
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,875 
He's got my

211
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,875 
wife and kid.

212
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,458 
There may be another way.

213
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,208 
You told me about the last

214
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,208 
seven years of your life.

215
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,958 
Haven't told you about mine.

216
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,125 
After Sara got exonerated,

217
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,125 
she left Panama.

218
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,166 
Me and Sofia stayed behind

219
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,166 
and opened a dive shop.

220
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,250 
We broke up,

221
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,250 
and everything went to hell.

222
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,666 
You weren't there to stop me,

223
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,666 
so before I knew it,

224
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,625 
I was in the old hood,

225
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,625 
doing odd jobs.

226
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,083 
Odd jobs meaning what?

227
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,666 
Moving things from point A

228
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,666 
to point B.

229
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,291 
For Luca Abruzzi.

230
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,833 
John Abruzzi's son.

231
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,500 
Yeah.

232
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,166 
I just wanted some quick

233
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,166 
cash to kick-start my life.

234
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,583 
They told me not to

235
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,583 
look in the boxes.

236
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,791 
But I looked in the boxes.

237
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,625 
The amount of fentanyl they're

238
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,625 
smuggling out of Europe--

239
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,166 
tens of thousands of

240
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,166 
pills in every box--

241
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,750 
it's just killing people.

242
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,500 
So I dumped a box in a Dumpster,

243
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,000 
100 grand's worth.

244
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,041 
Now you're in hock

245
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,041 
to Abruzzi's son.

246
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,166 
Yeah. He wants to kill me.

247
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,750 
But maybe it's a way to get back

248
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,750 
to the States real fast.

249
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,125 
LUCA:

250
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,125 
You got balls, Burrows.

251
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,708 
You actually think

252
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,708 
I want to help you?

253
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,041 
What if I can get you the $100K?

254
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,958 
(scoffs) $100K?

255
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,916 
How are you gonna

256
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,916 
come up with that--

257
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,916 
crawling around

258
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,916 
the back alleys of Chicago?

259
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,791 
I'm not in Chicago.

260
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,791 
I'm in Marseilles.

261
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,125 
(chuckles) Marseilles?

262
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,125 
Yeah.

263
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,625 
I've been working

264
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,625 
on a couple deals. I got $100K

265
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,750 
in my hand. But I

266
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,750 
want off the hook.

267
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,166 
Sure you do. How about you get

268
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,166 
over here and hand it to me?

269
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,916 
That's why I'm calling.

270
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,625 
I need to sneak into the States

271
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,625 
invisible, like your pills.

272
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,041 
Those flights you got

273
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,041 
coming out of Europe--

274
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,583 
the fentanyl flights--

275
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,583 
I need a few seats.

276
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,000 
(sighs)

277
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,083 
I'll tell you what.

278
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,791 
I'll make a few calls.

279
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,208 
'Cause either I'm gonna see you

280
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,125 
and get that money,

281
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,125 
or I'm gonna see you,

282
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,291 
and you're gonna get something

283
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,291 
a whole lot worse.

284
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,333 
(beep)

285
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,458 
I can't believe

286
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,458 
I'm doing this to myself again.

287
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:29,291 
Difference is this time

288
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:29,291 
you're not alone.

289
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,166 
(birds screeching)

290
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,458 
God, these things

291
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,458 
are disgusting.

292
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,041 
What they call 'em again?

293
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,416 
Boudin noir.

294
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,541 
Not sure what's in them.

295
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,416 
I don't think your French is

296
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,416 
as good as you think it is.

297
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,916 
Yo, be happy

298
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,916 
you're not eating snails.

299
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,500 
(indistinct chatter)

300
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,833 
Hey.

301
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,708 
Do you think

302
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,708 
they noticed?

303
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,166 
Let's not take any chances.

304
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,375 
Guys.

305
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,208 
Your faces were on the news.

306
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,125 
WHIP:

307
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,125 
Somebody sees you,

308
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,125 
this thing is over.

309
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,375 
We got to move, papi. 

310
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,375 
We got to go.

311
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,916 
(phone dinging)

312
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,541 
Hold. Luca.

313
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,041 
If you can get to Lyon

314
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,041 
by midnight,

315
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,958 
I can get you on a flight.

316
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,875 
I got a warehouse in New York.

317
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,875 
You're coming to me.

318
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,250 
We'll be there.

319
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,958 
Can't decide whether I want you

320
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,833 
to have that money

321
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,833 
or not, Burrows.

322
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,916 
Killing you might be

323
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,916 
a lot more satisfying.

324
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,833 
JACOB:

325
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,833 
Now we know they survived the

326
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,833 
strike in the Mediterranean.

327
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,083 
We can be pretty sure

328
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,083 
he's coming back to Ithaca.

329
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,583 
I need some clarification.

330
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,291 
Why would he come back here...

331
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,041 
to the States

332
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,958 
when he's more wanted here

333
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,833 
than anywhere else in the world?

334
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,458 
Of course.

335
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,333 
(clears throat)

336
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,000 
Because of them.

337
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,125 
He had a life

338
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,125 
before he worked for me,

339
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,458 
a name-- Michael Scofield.

340
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,208 
A family.

341
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,791 
And when he went away,

342
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,791 
I ended up looking after them.

343
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,166 
Ended up... falling for them.

344
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,875 
Well...

345
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,875 
He wants to kill me.

346
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,250 
He thinks I stole his life,

347
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,250 
ruined him, which speaks

348
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,166 
to his dissociative mind.

349
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,291 
I mean, he's a murderer,

350
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,291 
a turncoat, a terrorist.

351
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,250 
But we'll use it.

352
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,375 
I'll be the bait if I have to.

353
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,958 
So we can go about taking him

354
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,958 
down once and for all.

355
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,708 
He's not just gonna

356
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,708 
stroll in here.

357
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,875 
He's too clever for that.

358
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,750 
That's why we got someone

359
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,750 
even more clever.

360
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,708 
Thoreau?

361
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,375 
Guy's a pencil neck.

362
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,708 
A pencil neck with insight

363
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,708 
into Scofield's plan.

364
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,125 
So you, in turn,

365
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,125 
can be the hammer.

366
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,166 
(door opens)

367
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,583 
NELSON:

368
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,583 
Screen-grab

369
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,583 
of the Skype transmission

370
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,083 
he sent from the desert.

371
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,500 
He routed the image

372
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,500 
through a server

373
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,791 
to this BlueHawaii guy,

374
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,791 
but it could have been

375
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,583 
secretly subrouted

376
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,583 
to another, yet

377
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,000 
unknown, recipient to use

378
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,000 
the information encoded in it.

379
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,291 
Information?

380
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,208 
It's actually incredible.

381
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,791 
Encrypted in the Arabic, the

382
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,791 
images are all sorts of stuff.

383
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,833 
Apparently,

384
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,833 
mundane as hell.

385
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,291 
Visiting hours for zoos,

386
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,541 
links to defunct message boards

387
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,625 
on the Internet.

388
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,208 
What message boards?

389
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:38,000 
Truesnuff.com,

390
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:38,000 
Hunterspycamporn.com,

391
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,541 
both of which carry... this.

392
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:43,875 
Images of the Harlan

393
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:43,875 
Gaines murder.

394
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,333 
What's the bastard doing

395
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,333 
rubbing that in our faces?

396
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,541 
Of all the things

397
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,541 
to encrypt, why that?

398
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,083 
What's that get you?

399
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,791 
Stegaonographically, a lot.

400
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,875 
Steganography is the practice

401
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,875 
of concealing information

402
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,791 
in the code that

403
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,791 
makes up digital files.

404
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,291 
Russians do it,

405
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,291 
Chinese, everybody.

406
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,041 
He's probably thinking

407
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,041 
if anyone sees this,

408
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,916 
this'll be as far

409
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,916 
as they'll look.

410
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,916 
But I'm already going inside the

411
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,916 
image, breaking down the data

412
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,333 
that comprises it.

413
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,333 
This is making my head spin.

414
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,791 
Point is we put big data,

415
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,791 
AI on this,

416
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,625 
we can crunch any codes

417
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,625 
hidden in there pretty quickly.

418
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,208 
And that's what I'm doing.

419
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,166 
Nice work, but the truth is,

420
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,166 
if I've done my job,

421
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,791 
he may reveal his intentions

422
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,791 
to us first.

423
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,666 
(sighs)

424
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,166 
Because I've got him

425
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,166 
so far off his game now,

426
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,958 
he'll start

427
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,958 
to play his cards too early...

428
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,250 
Teddy.

429
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,416 
"But in return,

430
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,416 
you must take a life."

431
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,166 
JACOB: ...show us

432
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,166 
what the tattoos mean

433
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,250 
even before the computers will,

434
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,250 
and all the people

435
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,833 
he'll be enlisting

436
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,833 
for the fight.

437
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,583 
You have to call

438
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,583 
this pay phone

439
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,916 
in France.

440
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,916 
(woman speaking French

441
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,916 
over P.A. system)

442
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:15,166 
Wait. Chicago?

443
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:15,166 
I thought I was going with you.

444
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,708 
Not until you find out

445
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,708 
why you're my whip-hand.

446
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,666 
I have to go to Chicago

447
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,666 
to find that out?

448
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,041 
Safe travels.

449
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,291 
In the grandiosity of his plan,

450
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,041 
he'll lose sight

451
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,041 
of the simplest details.

452
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,916 
The phone he texted me with

453
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,875 
was located in Lyon,

454
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,875 
France last night.

455
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,625 
It was turned off in an airport

456
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,625 
terminal at 11:51 p.m...

457
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:48,041 
...20 minutes before a direct

458
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:48,041 
flight to New York where

459
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,458 
you'll be waiting for him

460
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,791 
to put this game

461
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,791 
to bed for good.

462
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,083 
WOMAN (over P.A.): 

463
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,083 
Flight 290 to Miami, Florida

464
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,208 
will now depart from gate B24.

465
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,750 
He just powered back up.

466
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,375 
(chiming)

467
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,791 
We got him.

468
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,333 
Look out!

469
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,833 
Back of the plane.

470
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,791 
Uh, excuse me!

471
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,791 
Excuse me.

472
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,333 
You're not allowed...

473
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:22,125 
(phone chirping)

474
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,708 
Looks like

475
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,708 
the game's still going.

476
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,333 
♪ ♪

477
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,750 
It's impressive

478
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,750 
how you get these drugs

479
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,500 
in the country

480
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,500 
just by bribing small-time

481
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,916 
airport officials.

482
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,500 
I'm guessing

483
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,500 
you got about

484
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,041 
five million bucks worth

485
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,041 
of fentanyl in here.

486
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,708 
So what?

487
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,375 
You and your brother here

488
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,375 
are gonna lecture me?

489
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,625 
We were actually

490
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,625 
debating on whether

491
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,875 
I should give you the 100K

492
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,875 
or not.

493
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,625 
He says it's blood money.

494
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,541 
I agree.

495
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,541 
How about you just

496
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,541 
shut up and pay me, Burrows?

497
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,833 
I don't have it.

498
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,000 
Grab his guys, bring 'em

499
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,000 
to the back and shoot 'em.

500
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,250 
I don't think you want to add

501
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,250 
murder to your arrest warrant.

502
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,583 
Wait.

503
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,041 
Arrest warrant?

504
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,625 
That guy out there

505
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,875 
is a DEA informant.

506
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,875 
We have him in our pocket.

507
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,458 
He owes us. He's

508
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,458 
got three vans

509
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,000 
full of agents

510
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,000 
that are waiting for his call.

511
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,583 
They're gonna rain down on you

512
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,583 
and your pills.

513
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,833 
Unless you forgive

514
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,833 
my brother's debt.

515
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,041 
Then our informant

516
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,041 
won't make the call.

517
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,916 
Have your brother fighting

518
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,916 
your battles, do you?

519
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,333 
No.

520
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,291 
Why don't you tell your guys

521
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,291 
to drop the guns,

522
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,875 
and you and I can have it out?

523
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,500 
What do you say, Luca?

524
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,708 
Scare that guy off.

525
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,875 
Bring these guys

526
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,875 
to the back.

527
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,458 
They make a move,

528
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,458 
he makes a call.

529
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,250 
Yeah? I think you're bluffing.

530
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,208 
I warned you.

531
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,666 
We got company.

532
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,833 
(engines revving)

533
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,875 
(tires squealing)

534
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,291 
MICHAEL:

535
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,291 
You shoot us, there's

536
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,291 
dozens of witnesses now.

537
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,666 
Let's go.

538
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,708 
(engines revving,

539
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,708 
tires squealing)

540
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,458 
(tires squealing)

541
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,458 
All they had to see

542
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,458 
were DEA hats and SUVs,

543
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,083 
and they were gone.

544
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,583 
Famous Michael Scofield.

545
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:57,416 
Sheba. Thank you

546
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:57,416 
for everything.

547
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:01,250 
You have no idea how happy

548
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:01,250 
I am to see you back home.

549
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,166 
We're not home yet.

550
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,291 
All right, so what's next?

551
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,666 
How do we get

552
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,666 
this son of a bitch?

553
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,125 
We don't do anything.

554
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,625 
Your part is over.

555
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,625 
No, no, no, no, no, no.

556
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,416 
Tricking Abruzzi's

557
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,416 
kid is one thing.

558
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,416 
Poseidon-- he knows your face.

559
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,291 
Been tracking you

560
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,291 
since you went to Yemen.

561
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,916 
You've been a warrior,

562
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,625 
and I owe you.

563
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,666 
But your face is a liability

564
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,666 
now to you and your family.

565
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,083 
I don't want you

566
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,083 
to risk that.

567
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,041 
They may know his face,

568
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,041 
but they don't know mine.

569
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,708 
It's the punch you don't see

570
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,708 
coming that knocks you out.

571
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,375 
That's my Sheba.

572
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,458 
You take care

573
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,458 
of her, all right?

574
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,583 
I take care of him, you mean.

575
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,166 
(laughs)

576
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,041 
I love you, brother.

577
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,458 
Love you, too.

578
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,916 
Be safe,

579
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,416 
okay?

580
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,416 
You, too.

581
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,125 
Bye.

582
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,125 
All right.

583
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,041 
Well...

584
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,833 
when you need me again,

585
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,541 
you know where to find me.

586
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,708 
(birds singing)

587
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,833 
We'll transport her

588
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,833 
at 1600 hours.

589
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,291 
Lay low until then.

590
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,291 
Thank you.

591
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,458 
Hey?

592
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,041 
That doesn't bother you--

593
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,041 
what you just saw in there?

594
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,250 
Down in the basement

595
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,416 
with his wife, the woman

596
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,416 
he says he fell for?

597
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,958 
Stop.

598
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,458 
I'm done with 21-Void

599
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,458 
after this.

600
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,208 
After we get Scofield... Outis--

601
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,375 
whatever his name is--

602
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,458 
I'm done.

603
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,333 
That's all I ever wanted,

604
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,333 
to get Gaines' killer, but

605
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,291 
what he's got

606
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,291 
going on in there--

607
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,708 
that's not normal.

608
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,125 
It's personal.

609
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,333 
Something sicker.

610
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,125 
There's no leaving 21-Void, Van.

611
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,125 
You know that.

612
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:15,375 
He hired us because

613
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:15,375 
we are the best.

614
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,250 
We can do

615
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,250 
whatever we want.

616
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,750 
And if we want to

617
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,750 
disappear after this...

618
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,875 
we can disappear.

619
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,291 
There's no getting out.

620
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,583 
If you think

621
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,583 
that way...

622
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,000 
then you're a prisoner, too.

623
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,750 
MAN: The guy at the gate

624
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,750 
said the vehicles split

625
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,250 
five minutes after

626
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,250 
they got here.

627
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,166 
Five minutes?

628
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,166 
Something ain't right.

629
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,541 
The product is still here.

630
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,000 
Come on.

631
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,708 
It was all staged.

632
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,875 
Clever.

633
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,458 
But Burrows is gonna die for it.

634
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,791 
I don't know

635
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,791 
how we're gonna find him.

636
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,041 
He's in the wind.

637
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,666 
Maybe not.

638
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,166 
EZ Pass transponders.

639
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,833 
Santora's got a guy

640
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,833 
at transit authority.

641
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,791 
I bet you he can us what roads

642
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,791 
they've been taking and when.

643
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:23,125 
Then it's up to us

644
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:23,125 
to comb the neighborhoods,

645
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,875 
find the vehicles,

646
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,833 
and put a bullet in that

647
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,833 
son of a bitch once and for all.

648
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:41,000 
MAN (over PA): Please keep your

649
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:41,000 
baggage with you at all times.

650
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,625 
Unattended baggage is a

651
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,625 
security risk and may result...

652
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,083 
I got a weird request.

653
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,125 
If I give you some coordinates,

654
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,125 
can you take me to 'em?

655
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,458 
See what I can do.

656
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,875 
No.

657
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,541 
Unless this cab's got pontoons,

658
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,375 
ain't gonna happen.

659
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,041 
These coordinates are in the

660
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,041 
middle of Lake Michigan.

661
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,583 
This is it.

662
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,583 
LINCOLN:

663
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,583 
No lights.

664
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,041 
I don't think

665
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,041 
they're here, Michael.

666
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,250 
Unless that's what

667
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,250 
he wants us to think.

668
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,750 
Come on.

669
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,625 
Get ready to get us out of here

670
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,625 
as fast as you can.

671
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,791 
SHEBA: Linc.

672
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,666 
Be careful.

673
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,666 
Thanks.

674
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,416 
What's wrong?

675
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,416 
That's why Sara never responded.

676
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,000 
I wasn't allowed

677
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,000 
to contact anyone,

678
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,666 
but she was my wife.

679
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,833 
I reached out to her in a way

680
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,250 
I thought only she would know.

681
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,541 
But he knew my ways, too.

What are you doing?

688
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,833 
That's not

689
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,833 
Sara, Michael.

690
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,250 
He doesn't know I know that.

691
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,250 
That's the right answer.

692
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,291 
She's alive.

693
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:07,583 
He must be right there with her.

694
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,791 
I'm gonna set a meeting.

695
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,958 
And what, you're just gonna

696
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,958 
show up and show your face?

697
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,666 
Yes.

698
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,250 
That means Poseidon

699
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,250 
has to show his face, too.

700
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,166 
And the endgame begins.

701
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,833 
It's high noon, boss.

702
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:37,125 
I'm not seeing him.

703
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,958 
And you shouldn't.

704
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,958 
He's waiting for us

705
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,166 
to push the first piece

706
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,166 
out onto the board.

707
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,375 
Which would be me?

708
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:46,916 
Maybe not.

709
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:48,791 
Black SUV.

710
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,916 
Something I can help you with?

711
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:56,541 
Car service. I'm here to

712
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:56,541 
pick up a lady and child.

713
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,625 
They got another ride.

714
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,625 
Hit the road.

715
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,208 
Are you sure?

716
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,708 
Hit the road.

717
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,125 
Mark the black SUV.

718
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,250 
No need. They were just here

719
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,250 
to make you show your face.

720
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,583 
Walk away, please. Now.

721
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,750 
Okay, act the tiniest bit

722
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,750 
flustered.

723
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,375 
Now repeat these words back

724
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,375 
to me loud enough to be heard:

725
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,708 
"They didn't show.

726
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,375 
I'm coming back to you now."

727
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,208 
They didn't show.

728
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,208 
I'm coming back to you now.

729
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,750 
Now we have a game.

730
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,666 
He's already revealed

731
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,666 
his brother, his biggest piece.

732
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:39,583 
Soon he'll have to

733
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:39,583 
show his face. Trailer,

734
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,583 
please take him down.

735
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,458 
What the...

736
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,375 
I lost him.

737
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,750 
Hey.

738
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,333 
Can you hear me?

739
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,625 
Damn it.

740
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,125 
No signal.

741
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:31,750 
What are you doing here?

742
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,083 
I lost reception in the garage.

743
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,333 
Damn it, you fell right into it.

744
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,750 
Now they've got

745
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,750 
a mark on us.

746
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,541 
Black sedan.

747
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,375 
He's heading west.

748
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,250 
Please!

749
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,541 
Please, don't shoot.

750
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,916 
You okay?

751
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,958 
So that's what the dog

752
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,958 
who's destroying my country

753
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,375 
looks like.

754
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,916 
(phone rings)

755
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,458 
Talk to me.

756
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,375 
LINCOLN:

757
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,375 
Michael, we found the car.

758
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,666 
We're on the corner of Third

759
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,666 
and Washington by an alley.

760
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,125 
Get here now.

761
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,541 
He had Sara with him

762
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:50,458 
but we couldn't see her.

763
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:50,458 
What do you mean

764
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:50,458 
you couldn't see her?

765
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,500 
SHEBA:

766
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,500 
There's no way we could have.

767
00:29:57,958 --> 00:30:00,708 
Oh, my God. Sara.

768
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:09,416 
There was no one

769
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,125 
in the backseat?

770
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,125 
No, the windows

771
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,000 
were blacked out--

772
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,000 
we couldn't see.

773
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:17,833 
What's that?

774
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,458 
My son did this.

775
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,125 
He's good.

776
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,666 
There might be

777
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,666 
something here.

778
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,625 
It's a ship.

779
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,166 
A pirate ship

780
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,166 
with three pirates--

781
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,666 
man, woman and a boy.

782
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,416 
That's me, Sara and... Mike.

783
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:33,958 
What do you

784
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:33,958 
think that is?

785
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,750 
It's a...

786
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,750 
it's a many-headed hydra

787
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,583 
reaching up to attack.

788
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:39,416 
Think it's Jacob?

789
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,125 
Must be.

790
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,708 
This is a message.

791
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,708 
You're telling me

792
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,750 
Mikey's left something

793
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,750 
encoded in that?

794
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,208 
Yeah. Yeah, it's encoded in him.

795
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,791 
He's got my DNA.

796
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:50,500 
He didn't even know

797
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:50,500 
you were coming.

798
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,708 
Sara must have told him.

799
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,708 
I don't know.

800
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,875 
She must have told him

801
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,875 
I was coming.

802
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:57,666 
There's definitely

803
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:57,666 
something here. Definitely.

804
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,250 
What is it?

805
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,958 
It's one of Luca's guys.

806
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:14,375 
SHEBA:

807
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:14,375 
What?

808
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,375 
How the hell did

809
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,375 
he track us here?

810
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,000 
I don't know.

811
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,000 
All I know is all the chickens

812
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,333 
are coming home to roost

813
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,333 
at the worst possible time.

814
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,875 
We got to go.

815
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:26,000 
Linc?

816
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:29,125 
I got it.

817
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,375 
This ship, this galleon.

818
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:34,791 
The body of water it's on.

819
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:34,791 
I looked at the map.

820
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:37,916 
There's a lake,

821
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:37,916 
a lake shaped exactly like it,

822
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:39,208 
up in the Finger Lakes district.

823
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,208 
"Long lake."

824
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,791 
This X

825
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:44,083 
would be on the east shore

826
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:44,083 
of that lake.

827
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,500 
He's telling us where he is.

828
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,333 
I'm trying to figure out if you

829
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,333 
lost your mind or not.

830
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,416 
There's only one way

831
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,416 
to find out.

832
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,833 
Uh-uh.

833
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,833 
What?

834
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,666 
You're going back

835
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,666 
to Buffalo.

836
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,666 
What?!

837
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:59,041 
I want you to be with your

838
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:59,041 
family, look after the refugees.

839
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,250 
Linc, I'm a part

840
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,250 
of this fight, too...

841
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,458 
What was that?

842
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,000 
It's good-bye.

843
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:14,500 
I could never forgive myself

844
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,625 
if something happened to you.

845
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,875 
Can I help you?

846
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:38,416 
Yeah.

847
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,875 
Can I rent a boat?

848
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,291 
I want to take one

849
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,291 
out on the lake.

850
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:52,500 
(sighs)

851
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,916 
(sighs)

852
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:10,625 
Been thinkin'.

853
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,416 
God...

854
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:17,458 
I been thinking.

855
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,500 
'Cause a hard bargain's

856
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,500 
been presented to me,

857
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,291 
and I'm considering something

858
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,500 
that's-that's gonna seem like

859
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,458 
the old Theodore Bagwell.

860
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,333 
T-Bag. (chuckles)

861
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,583 
And if that's indeed

862
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,583 
what's coming...

863
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:41,666 
...it won't be the work

864
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,458 
of a cold-blooded man.

865
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,916 
And it won't be for sin...

866
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,625 
...or for hate.

867
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:59,583 
If there's blood on my hands,

868
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,458 
know this, world...

869
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,500 
...it'll be for love.

870
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,625 
♪ ♪

871
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:34,458 
How you doing, buddy?

872
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,750 
I'm sick of the lake house.

873
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,375 
I want to go home.

874
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,625 
I know. I know.

875
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,166 
(sighs) We'll go home soon.

876

She's, uh...

She's just resting.

Everything will be fine, kiddo.

I never heard from her again.

What are you trying to tell me?

936
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:38,833 
Scofield was looking

937
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:38,833 
for a partner, combing prisons,

938
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:41,625 
looking for someone

939
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:41,625 
who could handle himself.

940
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:46,000 
And with your

in even the worst of cages,

944
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,583 
you reminded him

945
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,583 
of a certain someone.

946
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:54,083 
And so he did

947
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:54,083 
a little research.

948
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:57,083

what we all want to know.

950
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:59,541
