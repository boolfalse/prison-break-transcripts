1
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,541 
(men shouting)

2
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:12,583 
WHIP:

3
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:12,583 
We got to move.

4
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,250 
No. We go out on the streets

5
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,250 
tonight, we're dead.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,666 
You know it

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,666 
and I know it.

8
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:20,000 
Even on the outside,

9
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:20,000 
I feel the world crushing in.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,958 
LINCOLN: That's what

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,958 
being locked up does.

12
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,375 
You carry the prison

13
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,375 
with you on the outside.

14
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,416 
I can't live that way.

15
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,833 
I've got to know

16
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,833 
the walls disappear.

17
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:34,250 
It's called being scared.

18
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:34,250 
Happens when you're sober.

19
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,458 
Don't give me the pill talk.

20
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,625 
I won't give you

21
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,625 
the poor little orphan talk.

22
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,875 
How your friend here

23
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,666 
isn't the father figure

24
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,666 
you thought he was gonna be.

25
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,875 
This isn't helping.

26
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,666 
The walls are going

27
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,666 
away, brother.

28
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,958 
We're gonna make 'em go away.

29
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,125 
We're getting out

30
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,125 
of this country.

31
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,666 
All of us.

32
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,583 
WHIP: Oh, really? Which

33
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,583 
contingency's that gonna be?

34
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,791 
You burned

35
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,791 
through them all.

36
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,125 
Truck to border, train, airport.

37
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,291 
MICHAEL:

38
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,291 
None of those.

39
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,625 
We're exactly where

40
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,250 
I don't want to be:

41
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,250 
improvising.

42
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,708 
Well, we need to

43
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,708 
improvise something real fast

44
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,166 
or it's gonna be us down there,

45
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,458 
strung up like that.

46
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,458 
Omar. Sheba's guy.

47
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,250 
She said he

48
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,250 
had a way out.

49
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,458 
We can trust him?

50
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:15,041 
No. But he's our last option.

51
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,708 
(door buzzes)

52
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:33,750 
You made bail.

53
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:33,750 
You're being released.

54
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,583 
WOMAN:

55
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,583 
Mmm! Don't be a stranger, sugar.

56
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,500 
Poseidon got you out first.

57
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,500 
I thought I was his favorite.

58
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,083 
AW: Son of a bitch

59
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,083 
really escaped.

60
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,500 
Yep.

61
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,625 
But why kill Ramal?

62
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,625 
I thought they were allies.

63
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:05,000 
It's not our job

64
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:05,000 
to ask questions.

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,416 
Maybe we should.

66
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:11,333 
Poseidon says we find

67
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:11,333 
Kaniel Outis and kill him.

68
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,916 
That's what we're gonna do.

69
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,500 
And I think I know how to do it.

70
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,541 
(explosions, men yelling)

71
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,083 
(men yelling, women screaming)

72
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,958 
LINCOLN:

73
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,958 
Omar.

74
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,083 
(mumbles in Arabic)

75
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,666 
What are you doing here?

76
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,625 
You're radioactive, my friend.

77
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,500 
You killed Abu Ramal. Really?

78
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500 
That was a very stupid move,

79
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500 
man.

80
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,875 
Just tell us

81
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,875 
where you're headed.

82
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,791 
300 miles across the desert.

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,791 
Phaeacia.

84
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,541 
Old smuggling

85
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,541 
friends.

86
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,916 
Uh, autonomous zone. No ISIL.

87
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,125 
Perfect.

88
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,875 
Not perfect.

89
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,000 
Four of you, one of me.

90
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,000 
Not enough seats.

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,833 
Okay, okay, all right. What

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,833 
about getting another vehicle?

93
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,375 
Tell you what.

94
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,208 
Because it's Sheba

95
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,208 
and I owe her,

96
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,041 
maybe we can help each other.

97
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,416 
I have another vehicle.

98
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,500 
A Land Cruiser.

99
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,208 
I was going to

100
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,208 
leave it behind,

101
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,708 
but if you can get it,

102
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,250 
it's in a parking garage

103
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,250 
two blocks from here.

104
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,583 
I'll let you follow.

105
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,750 
Deliver my second vehicle,

106
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,458 
and maybe I get the Phaeacians

107
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,458 
to get you a boat somewhere,

108
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,750 
to Europe, France, Italy, Spain,

109
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,750 
wherever you want to go.

110
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,583 
How's that sound?

111
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,375 
Keys are here.

112
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:38,708 
Uh, left side, the red brick.

113
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:38,708 
First floor.

114
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,916 
Battery might be dead,

115
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,916 
so you might need

116
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,541 
all of you to push.

117
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,541 
We got it.

118
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,250 
Whip, you stay with him.

119
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,250 
Let's move.

120
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,333 
He always give you orders

121
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,333 
like that?

122
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,916 
It's complicated.

123
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,333 
I got an order for you.

124
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,958 
Load up.

125
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,625 
One more bag inside.

126
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,791 
JA:

127
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,791 
There!

128
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,791 
Give it a push on my say.

129
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,000 
(engine starts)

130
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,708 
Battery's working

131
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,708 
perfectly.

132
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,041 
How far away is this garage?

133
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,166 
Only two blocks.

134
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,166 
No problem.

135
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,166 
(sighs)

136
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,125 
Someone says there's no problem,

137
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,125 
there's always a problem.

138
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,041 
He set us up.

139
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,041 
Get in!

140
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:44,166 
(yelling in Arabic)

141
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,416 
Hold on!

142
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,958 
(automatic gunfire)

143
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,291 
(tires screech)

144
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,291 
(yelling in Arabic)

145
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,666 
♪ ♪

146
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,875 
Nothing personal, my friend.

147
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,375 
In another life, no doubt

148
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,375 
we smoke the hookah together.

149
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,375 
(grunts)

150
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,083 
(vehicle approaching)

151
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,416 
(muffled groan)

152
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,041 
(groans loudly)

153
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,083 
LINCOLN: No!

154
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,083 
No, you don't!

155
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,333 
(groans, grunts)

156
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,083 
Whip, you okay?

157
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,750 
Thought you were gonna be

158
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,750 
a millionaire, huh?

159
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,750 
I didn't have a choice.

160
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,166 
(grunts)

161
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,125 
Come on! Coldcocking

162
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,125 
son of a bitch!

163
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,958 
Hold on, hold on. Easy

164
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,958 
now, we may need him.

165
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,958 
Yes. You need me.

166
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,333 
(groans)

167
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,875 
I want a map

168
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,875 
to this Phaeacia place.

169
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,916 
You do realize this is Yemen,

170
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,916 
don't you?

171
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,041 
Phaeacia

172
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,041 
is a hundred people.

173
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,250 
Mud huts. There is no map.

174
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,041 
But I can lead you there.

175
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,166 
You want to

176
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,166 
trust this guy?

177
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,083 
Well, if he screws with us,

178
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,416 
we'll just let Whip finish

179
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,416 
what he started.

180
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,208 
And I will kill you.

181
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,375 
(chuckles) I can't wait

182
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,375 
to kill him.

183
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,791 
You coldcock me, I end you.

184
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,250 
Rule number one in my country.

185
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,250 
Okay?

186
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,791 
And rule number one

187
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,791 
in my country is

188
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,041 
when things get bad,

189
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,041 
go to the desert.

190
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,541 
We are desperate, desperate men.

191
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,250 
Not as desperate as Omar

192
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,250 
right now.

193
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,750 
If there's one man

194
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,750 
you don't want

195
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,416 
to get on the wrong side of,

196
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,416 
it's Whip.

197
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,666 
That might apply to you, too,

198
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,666 
Michael.

199
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,041 
I get the sense the kid thinks

200
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,041 
you betrayed him somehow.

201
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,041 
I could understand

202
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,041 
why he thinks that.

203
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,083 
I really am sorry, my friend.

204
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,208 
When I'm scared,

205
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,208 
I make poor choices.

206
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,000 
Zero comes out of your mouth.

207
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,000 
Okay?

208
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,708 
I'm having a really bad

209
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,708 
couple days. Just the worst.

210
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,458 
(sighs)

211
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,208 
(knocking)

212
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,208 
Agent Kishida.

213
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,625 
Settling into your new office,

214
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,625 
I see.

215
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,291 
I still see this

216
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,291 
as Kellerman's office, ma'am.

217
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,666 
As you probably know,

218
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,750 
before

219
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,750 
he was killed,

220
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,291 
Kellerman had been

221
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,291 
looking into 21-Void.

222
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,791 
I knew that. Yes.

223
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,458 
I need Paul's files.

224
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,583 
Obviously, he was getting close

225
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,583 
to something

226
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,083 
and they killed him

227
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,083 
for it.

228
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,083 
Actually, I've been

229
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,083 
looking into his leads,

230
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,833 
and there's nothing there.

231
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,458 
I hate to say it, but this file

232
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,458 
is full of dead ends.

233
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,291 
There's nothing here.

234
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,583 
There must be something.

235
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,375 
Look, I don't want Paul

236
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,375 
to have died in vain,

237
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,625 
but we need to look at this

238
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,625 
whole thing with new eyes.

239
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,000 
Read it for yourself.

240
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,375 
Okay, you want to put

241
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,375 
new eyes on this? Fine.

242
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,041 
Now that you

243
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,041 
report to me,

244
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,625 
I need you to look

245
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,625 
into the possibility

246
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,250 
that there was an insider

247
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,250 
involved.

248
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,916 
Here? At the State Department?

249
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,750 
Anywhere along

250
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,750 
the evidence chain.

251
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,458 
Will do, ma'am.

252
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,333 
(phone ringing)

253
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,416 
Agent Kishida.

254
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,125 
I wasn't expecting

255
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,125 
a call at this hour.

256
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,541 
I just wanted to follow up

257
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,541 
on our earlier conversation.

258
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,958 
The situation

259
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,958 
in the Middle East?

260
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,541 
Situation's developing.

261
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,166 
We need to meet soon.

262
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,208 
Fair enough.

263
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,250 
The moment we're back,

264
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,250 
we'll call you.

265
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,333 
You worked at NSA?

266
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,458 
Team Eye in the Sky

267
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,458 
for ten years.

268
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,708 
Watched the most heinous crap

269
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,708 
you can imagine

270
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,750 
by satellite.

271
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,000 
Stonings, rapes.

272
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,125 
Just had to sit back and watch

273
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,125 
it like a horror film, helpless,

274
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,333 
until Poseidon

275
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,333 
tapped my shoulder,

276
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,833 
gave me a chance to do

277
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,833 
something about it.

278
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,208 
Emily, good to see you again.

279
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,500 
Likewise.

280
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,833 
You got my message?

281
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,833 
Kaniel Outis?

282
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,375 
You gonna help

283
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,375 
us locate him?

284
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,625 
Look, protocol says no.

285
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,666 
We stay clear of CIA,

286
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,666 
any offensive action.

287
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,250 
We're surveillance

288
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,250 
only.

289
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,583 
We just want to put eyes on him.

290
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,208 
I think I can get you

291
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,208 
in as observers

292
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,833 
under interagency auspices.

293
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,833 
I knew I could count on you.

294
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,333 
But you owe me.

295
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,166 
That BB we went up to

296
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,166 
in Connecticut,

297
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,666 
I want that weekend again.

298
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,666 
That exact weekend.

299
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,791 
What you got

300
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,791 
back here, anyway?

301
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,500 
What is this, guns, drugs?

302
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,458 
Fireworks?

303
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,541 
OMAR: You don't

304
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,541 
understand the Phaeacians.

305
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,000 
They are beautiful. Generous.

306
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,708 
They just want to smile.

307
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,041 
Unlike you.

308
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,750 
Oh, is that right?

309
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,000 
Ah, holding grudges.

310
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,708 
It's very bad for the heart...

311
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,333 
You know what else

312
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,333 
is bad for your heart?

313
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,958 
If I shove a Roman candle

314
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,958 
through the middle of it.

315
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,041 
Ja, please.

316
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,291 
Don't check out on us.

317
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,541 
Still trying to figure out

318
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,541 
why you got me out.

319
00:11:56,541 --> 00:12:00,416 
I need that great big mind

320
00:11:56,541 --> 00:12:00,416 
of yours clean and clear.

321
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,333 
(phone ringing)

322
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,333 
JA: It's the number from

323
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,333 
the airport last night.

324
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,916 
C-Note, what's up?

325
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,333 
SHEBA:

326
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,333 
<i>Lincoln, it's Sheba.</i>

327
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,666 
<i>I got Benjamin's phone.</i>

328
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,291 
Oh, hi.

329
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,291 
Did you find Omar?

330
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,083 
Yeah, we found him.

331
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,375 
We're traveling.

332
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,166 
You okay?

333
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,291 
Yes.

334
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,291 
We're in Jordan.

335
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:27,000 
Leaving for the U.S. tonight.

336
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,583 
How's C-Note?

337
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,666 
He's fine.

338
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,416 
We all are.

339
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,000 
Everyone.

340
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,625 
We're going to make it.

341
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,041 
It's because of you.

342
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,875 
(chuckles)

343
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,875 
Because of my money.

344
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,250 
It's because of you.

345
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,708 
Come on.

346
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,083 
There is nobility in you,

347
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,083 
Lincoln.

348
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,541 
Hey, uh...

349
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,541 
when I get back,

350
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,541 
I'll, I'll buy you a drink.

351
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,833 
I don't drink.

352
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,875 
But I'll buy you a drink.

353
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,125 
How about that?

354
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,000 
Sounds good.

355
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,416 
MAN:

356
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,416 
We got a hit;

357
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,000 
Franklin's cell phone

358
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,000 
lit up in Jordan.

359
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,083 
AW: The one he bought

361
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,041 
a few days ago.

Making an outbound call

363
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,041 
to an unknown number.

Currently right

365
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,583 
outside Sana'a, Yemen.

366
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,625 
Rerouting a drone

367
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,625 
to that target now.

368
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,166 
We just found our man,

369
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,166 
didn't we?

370
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,625 
There. Two vehicles

371
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,625 
heading west.

372
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,875 
Drones in position.

Let's take a peek.

374
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,000 
TECH:

375
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,000 
They're stopping.

TRICIA: Pull up all known data

on that location.

378
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,791 
Why did we stop?

379
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,916 
Phaeacia is 300 miles that way.

380
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,916 
We need to fill our

381
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,916 
gas tanks up to the top.

382
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,541

<i>Alaykumu s-salaam.</i>

384
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,541 
Michael, where you going?

385
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,708 
Been under Poseidon's thumb

386
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,291 
for the last seven years.

387
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,166 
It's about time I got

388
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,166 
out from under it.

389
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,833 
Internet?

390
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,583 
100 rial a minute.

391
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,833 
<i>Shukraan.</i>

392
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,541 
They have no clue we're

393
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,541 
watching, do they?

394
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,416 
Not at this height.

395
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,500 
(man shouting in Arabic)

396
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,000 
It's an American. CIA.

397
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,250 
(phone ringing)

398
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,000 
(man yelling, metal slicing)

399
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,666 
Who is this?

400
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,250 
A friend from far away.

401
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,083 
Your government has always

402
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,083 
considered us an enemy.

403
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,500 
<i>Officially.</i>

404
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,416 
But some of us have

405
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,416 
a more enlightened view.

406
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,250 
Abu Ramal was a great visionary.

407
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,916 
<i>You have our</i>

408

What do you want?

410
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,458 
<i>The same thing you do,</i>

411

to eliminate the men

00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,958 
who killed him.

413
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,333 
And as a sign of good faith...

414
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,208 
we'll tell you exactly

415
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,208 
where they are.

416
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,166 
MALE VOICE:

417
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,166 
<i>Hey, can you see me?</i>

418
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,500 
Not yet.

<i>Blasted computer camera thing.</i>

00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,291 
<i>All right, I see you.</i>

422
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,500 
CYCLOPS: Come on, hurry.

423
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,500 
Get this off of me.

424
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,625 
YASSER:

425
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,625 
Hold your hand still.

426
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,875 
Just do it already.

427
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,625 
Do you want to stay like this?

428
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,166 
You're lucky

429
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,166 
we cut you loose.

430
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,500 
ISIL LIEUTENANT (over radio):

431
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,500 
<i>The men who killed Abu Ramal,</i>

432
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,083 
<i>Leaving Sana'a, heading west</i>

Okay.

<i>Highway 80.</i>

436
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,583 
We're leaving now.

00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,541 
(yells in Arabic)

438
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,750 
(men yelling in Arabic)

439
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,000 
I'm coming, too.

440
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,000 
No.

441
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,458 
This is not your fight anymore.

442
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,416 
Understand?

443
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,958 
Get out! Get out now!

444
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,500 
No! Please!

445
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,958 
You know it's been four years

446
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,958 
since I've had air conditioning?

447
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,333 
I'm done with the heat.

448
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,500 
Kind of like it out here.

449
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,458 
No walls.

450
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,416 
No walls, okay?

451
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,416 
Ain't about walls.

452
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,250 
(clicks tongue)

453
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,708 
My opinion,

454
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,708 
you know what you need

455
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,250 
more than anything else

456
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,250 
in the world?

457
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,875 
Got to laugh more.

458
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,708 
If he wants to laugh,

459
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,333 
Phaeacia's the place.

460
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,291 
I always wanted

461
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,291 
to bring Sheba;

462
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,541 
for her to see

463
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,541 
the people.

464
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,791 
No technology,

465
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,791 
no politics,

466
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,166 
no modern nonsense.

467
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,833 
They know how

468
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,833 
to enjoy life.

469
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,416 
No technology?

470
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,666 
Freddie Mercury here

471
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,666 
couldn't hack it.

472
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,916 
Freddie Mercury?

473
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,416 
I could hack it.

474
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,541 
I was alive before cell phones.

475
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,125 
You're more addicted to

that screen than you are

477
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,708 
to them pills, and that

478
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,708 
is saying something.

479
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,208 
(man yells in Arabic)

480
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,458 
(radio chirps)

481
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,708 
Be ready.

482
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,625 
Ah, my friends.

483
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,625 
We got problems!

484
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,708 
Michael, we got to go!

00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,375 
Michael?

00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,375 
Let's go!

487
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,625 
I got to go.

488
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,083

00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,333 
<i>Can you see me now?</i>

491
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,208 
No. Take a screen capture.

492
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,458 
<i>What of?</i>

493
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,875 
A screen capture. Take it.

494
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,500 
ISIL militants

495
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,500 
coming from the east.

496
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,291 
This should get interesting.

497
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,333 
Don't think one bullet is going

498
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,333 
to get us out of this.

499
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,250 
One bullet? Who the hell carries

500
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,250 
a gun with one bullet?

501
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,833 
The man who would kill himself

502
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,833 
before being captured by ISIL.

503
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,375

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,750 
Get closer. Zoom in.

510

TRICIA:

511
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,000 
Hold on.

512
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,375 
These militants,

513
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,375 
how'd they find them?

514
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,250 
LINCOLN: Goddamn it, what are

515
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,250 
you waiting for? Shoot back!

516
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,666 
We only got one bullet.

517
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,125 
One bullet?

518
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,125 
Exactly.

519
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,500 
(gunfire)

520
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,916 
We're seriously

521
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,916 
screwed here.

522
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,041 
Unless I can make

523
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,041 
this one bullet count.

524
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,291 
What?

00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,666 
You sure as hell

529
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,666 
made it count, kid.

530
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,666 
(mumbles)

531
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,750 
(coughs)

532
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,750 
Hell yeah, you did.

533
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,083 
(groans)

534
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,625 
LINCOLN:

535
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,625 
My God!

536
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,166 
Michael.

537
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,583 
He's in a

538
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,583 
bad way, Linc.

539
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,916 
(Omar groaning)

540
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,000 
More coming, we got to get

541
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,000 
the hell out of here!

542
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,375 
(brakes grind, men groaning)

543
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,083 
(gurgles, sputters)

544
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,083 
(gasping)

545
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,625 
(groaning)

546
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,333 
What are they stopping for?

547
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,416 
LINCOLN:

548
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,416 
Don't know.

549
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,375 
We can't go any further.

550
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,458 
We can go a lot further.

551
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,750 
We've got to get to Phaeacia.

552
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,083 
There's no roads, Whip.

553
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,333 
The roads are in Omar's

554
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,333 
head along with the map.

555
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,625 
That's what I'm trying

556
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,625 
to tell you.

557
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,708 
Our map is dead.

558
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,125 
We got to head back.

559
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,375 
To what?

560
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,333 
He's right.

561
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,791 
We'll die out there

562
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,791 
without a map.

563
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,583 
We don't know that.

564
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,541 
We 99% know that.

565
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,083 
(gunshots)

566
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,416 
Guess we're not

567
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,416 
out of the woods yet!

568
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,750 
We got to lose this guy,

569
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,750 
whoever he is!

570
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,750 
Let's go!

571
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,750 
Then move it, damn it.

572
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,333 
(yells)

573
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,375 
(engine starts)

574
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,625 
All targets now bearing 2:15.

575
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,083 
Stay with them.

576
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,250 
No. Pull the drone.

577
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,750 
Time for our visitors to leave.

578
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,708 
What are you talking about?

579
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,041 
We find Kaniel Outis in Yemen,

580
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,916 
and then rebels show up

581
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,916 
to take him out?

582
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,750 
Was I supposed to think

583
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,750 
that was a coincidence?

584
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,708 
This isn't surveillance,

585
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,708 
is it?

586
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,458 
This is assassination.

587
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,083 
You're using me for some sort

588
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,083 
of black work, aren't you?

589
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,833 
This is way over your head,

590
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,833 
Tricia.

591
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,791 
Stop asking questions.

592
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,500 
If you don't get out of my

593
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,500 
sight, I will blow the whistle.

594
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,458 
Right now.

595
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:24,458 
Would've been a hell

596
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:24,458 
of a weekend in Connecticut.

597
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,625 
VAN GOGH: It's playing

598
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,625 
with fire,

599
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,583 
co-opting other

600
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,583 
agencies like that.

601
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,250 
You think she'll talk?

602
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,500 
Run it up the flag pole?

603
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,708 
You got designs on killing her?

604
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,083 
I'll kill you.

605
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,166 
Relax, will you?

606
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,166 
I'm getting pretty tired

607
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,166 
of chasing Outis.

608
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,916 
Always being behind him.

609
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,916 
Me, too.

610
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,041 
That's why I keep thinking about

611
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,041 
all that time that he spent

612
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,916 
in that gas

613
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,916 
station in Yemen.

614
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,750 
ISIL on his tail,

615
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,833 
and he just hangs in there?

616
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:08,750 
What was he

617
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:08,750 
doing in there?

618
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:24,041 
The sun is directly overhead.

619
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,000 
I can't tell which way

620
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,000 
is east, west...

621
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,166 
We got to stop.

622
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,916 
MICHAEL:

623
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,916 
Hey, Ja.

624
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,375 
You got a compass on that phone?

625
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,375 
No signal.

626
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,458 
We're flying blind.

627
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,625 
Completely blind.

628
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,916 
But he's not.

629
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:53,291 
We're leaving him a beautiful

630
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:53,291 
set of tire tracks to follow.

631
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,875 
Who the hell is this guy?

632
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,875 
MICHAEL:

633
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,875 
It's the guy who killed Sid.

634
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,750 
Son of a bitch is like

635
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,750 
a dog with a bone, huh?

636
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,916 
You kill someone's

637
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,916 
spiritual leader,

638
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,500 
they'll follow you to the ends

639
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,500 
of the Earth, apparently.

640
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500 
Why is he stopping?

641
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,375 
MICHAEL:

642
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,375 
He's refueling.

643
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,833 
JA:

644
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,833 
Now?

645
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,500 
He knows he's got

646
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,500 
more gas than we do.

647
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,083 
All he has to do

648
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,083 
is follow our tracks.

649
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,250 
Then wait until we run out.

650
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,916 
WHIP:

651
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,916 
There are four of us.

652
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,250 
Let's just swarm him,

653
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,250 
take him out.

654
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,375 
LINCOLN:

655
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,375 
Not out here.

656
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,208 
Not with an AK-47.

657
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,833 
We wouldn't get

658
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,833 
within a hundred feet of him

659
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,291 
without taking a bullet.

660
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,958 
Then we got to outthink him.

661
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,250 
(opens door)

662
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,666 
What you gonna do

663
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,666 
with that, flog him?

664
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,500 
Gonna transfer gas

665
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,500 
from that tank to this one.

666
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,416 
Almost all of it.

667
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:43,958 
It's not gonna help.

668
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:48,083 
It's gonna help this one

669
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:48,083 
get to Phaeacia.

670
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,375 
We pile into one vehicle?

671
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,916 
He still has more gas than us.

672
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:52,625 
He can still follow

673
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:52,625 
our tire tracks.

674
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,583 
That's why we leave a little bit

675
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,583 
of gas in that one.

676
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,500 
And make two sets of tracks.

677
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,333 
He's gonna have to choose.

678
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,208 
I got four rocks in my hand.

679
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,833 
Three red, one white.

680
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:15,208 
Get the red rock,

681
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:15,208 
get in the Jeep, go to Phaeacia.

682
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,375 
Get the white rock,

683
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,833 
deal with our friend.

684
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,833 
Stick out your hand.

685
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,250 
Red.

686
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,375 
Whip. Come on.

687
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,041 
Red.

688
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:50,791 
Linc.

689
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,291 
No.

690
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,416 
You knew the rules, Linc.

691
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:02,208 
He's picking up again.

692
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,750 
I'm not leaving you out here

693
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,750 
to die.

694
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,541 
I have no intention

695
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,541 
of dying.

696
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,958 
Anyway, you've got

697
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,958 
the harder job.

698
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,083 
You've gotta find Phaeacia

699
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,083 
out there somewhere.

700
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,958 
Leave tracks...

701
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,958 
so I know how to find you.

702
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,166
