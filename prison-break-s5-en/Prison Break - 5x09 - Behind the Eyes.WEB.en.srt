1
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,750 
Do you know

2
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,750 
that you're a psychopath?

3
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,708 
I assure you, I'm not the first

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,708 
CIA man to hide his life

5
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,125 
from his family.

6
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,666 
You hid it from the CIA.

7
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,458 
Look, you want to screw

8
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,458 
something up?

9
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,708 
Put a thousand people on it.

10
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,708 
You want to get it done right?

11
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,625 
Put it in the hands of a few.

12
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,625 
What we were doing

13
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,000 
was advancing

14
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,000 
this country's cause.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,541 
How does freeing a man

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,541 
like Abu Ramal

17
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,500 
advance this country's cause?

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,000 
Well, it doesn't.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,541 
The missions before,

20
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,375 
they were for the good

21
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,375 
of the country, but...

22
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,916 
No, this one

23
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,916 
wasn't about country.

24
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,208 
It was about you.

25
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,875 
Nobody wants to die

26
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,875 
to their old life, Sara.

27
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,125 
And Michael didn't.

28
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:07,416 
He wanted to hold on to it

29
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:07,416 
so desperately.

30
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,166 
In that moment, I wanted him

31
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,166 
to go away,

32
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,833 
the whole agreement,

33
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:13,916 
and just have you.

34
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,833 
You sent him to Yemen to die.

35
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,750 
Kept telling myself

36
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,750 
this was gonna be my last lie.

37
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,583 
That it would fade with time

38
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,583 
as we had anniversaries,

39
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,458 
raised that beautiful child.

40
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,166 
That is not your child.

41
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,708 
I raised him.

42
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:30,875 
That love is real.

43
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,041 
It's not a lie.

44
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,250 
You are using him as bait.

45
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,875 
You son of a bitch.

46
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,500 
She knows not to hurt him.

47
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,541 
You were so obsessed

48
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,541 
with Michael

49
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,708 
that you would risk my son!

50
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,791 
Michael? You mean you.

51
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,791 
You don't love me.

52
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,791 
Your ego's too big.

53
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,083 
You're too busy trying to be

54
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,083 
the smartest man in the room.

55
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,416 
And then you met my husband,

56
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,833 
and you realized

57
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,166 
he's smarter than you.

58
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,375 
(laughs)

59
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,875 
I don't think so.

60
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:55,958 
You sure?

61
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,625 
I'm positive.

62
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,666 
Our love was real, Sara.

63
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,166 
Past tense.

64
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,000 
I still love you.

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,208 
Everything's set, boss.

66
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,500 
Good.

67
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,250 
Got to give

68
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,250 
you credit.

69
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,291 
You'll go the whole nine yards

70
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,291 
to help one man

71
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,583 
steal another man's wife.

72
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:21,875 
No, no, no.

73
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:21,875 
Don't talk to him.

74
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,625 
Or what?

75
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,625 
He'll do something

76
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,708 
you're not already gonna do?

77
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,708 
You're going to kill me.

78
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,791 
No matter how many times you

79
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,791 
tell me you love me first.

80
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,458 
Shut up!

81
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,208 
Michael didn't kill

82
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,208 
Harlan Gaines. He had no motive.

83
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,958 
Shut up.

84
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,958 
He's the one with the motive.

85
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,791 
Harlan Gaines was

86
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,791 
your CIA director

87
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,416 
and he was looking

88
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,416 
into Jacob.

89
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,375 
He was gonna

90
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,375 
put him prison.

91
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,583 
Damn it!

92
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,541 
Tape her mouth shut, please.

93
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,041 
Tape it shut.

94
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,333 
(tape unrolling)

95
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,375 
If you do, an innocent man dies,

96
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,458 
and the real killer walks.

97
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,333 
Don't you understand?

98
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,375 
Jacob killed

99
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,375 
Harlan Gaines.

100
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,791 
Just shut it.

101
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,250 
Is there a problem?

102
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,875 
JACOB: Here he comes.

103
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,875 
It's time to do this.

104
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,541 
This place is gonna burn down

105
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,541 
in ten minutes.

106
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:24,208 
There will be two bodies in it.

107
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,541 
And if it's

108
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,541 
any solace,

109
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,083 
our son won't be one of them.

110
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,000 
(grunts)

111
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,750 
(door opens, closes)

112
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,583 
While the cat's away,

113
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,583 
the mice will play.

114
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,208 
Something's wrong.

115
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,208 
(sniffling)

116
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,541 
I got your map.

117
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,625 
I'm gonna get you

118
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,625 
and your mother out of here.

119
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,916 
I didn't draw a map.

120
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,833 
We need to run.

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,791 
VAN GOGH:

122
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,791 
Wait.

123
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,541 
What are you doing up here, Van?

124
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,666 
I just want to make sure that

125
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,666 
we're getting the right guy.

126
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,250 
Ask him

127
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,250 
some questions.

128
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,166 
(grunting)

129
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,791 
Let my son go.

130
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,958 
Do whatever you want with me.

131
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,416 
Just let my son go.

132
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,000 
Orders weren't to ask questions.

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,291 
It was to shoot on sight.

134
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,041 
(grunts)

135
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,291 
VAN GOGH:

136
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,291 
Maybe we should

137
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,291 
ask questions, damn it.

138
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,416 
If Scofield killed

139
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,416 
Harlan Gaines,

140
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,416 
we take him to the police,

141
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,416 
if we have to.

142
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,541 
We get this done

143
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,541 
the right way.

144
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,125 
Poseidon would

145
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,125 
never let us live.

146
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,458 
He won't find us.

147
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,208 
I told you. We want

148
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,208 
to disappear, we disappear.

149
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,208 
I can make

150
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,208 
that happen.

151
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,000 
We turn him in,

152
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,250 
and we're gone.

153
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,041 
Don't make me choose like this.

154
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,250 
Emily.

155
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,125 
Is it really even a choice?

156
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,791 
No.

157
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,166 
'Cause there's no leaving

158
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,166 
21-Void.

159
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,958 
Go.

160
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,208 
Your uncle's

161
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,208 
at the end of the driveway.

162
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,125 
Don't turn around.

163
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,125 
Run! Go!

164
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,625 
(gunshots)

165
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,625 
(grunts)

166
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,291 
Sara.

167
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,625 
SARA:

168
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,625 
Where's our boy?

169
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,833 
Uncle Lincoln, Uncle Lincoln!

170
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,875 
No, no, no, it's me.

171
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,875 
What's going on?

172
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,875 
They're shooting.

173
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,875 
I'm scared.

174
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,916 
Okay. They've come for you.

175
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,916 
Who?

176
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,041 
I am not gonna

177
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,041 
let them hurt you,

178
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,708 
you understand?

179
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,708 
Get in the car.

180
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,333 
No, we've got to go now, Mike.

181
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,333 
We've got to go.

182
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,458 
What about my mom?

183
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,500 
Go, go, go.

184
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,875 
(tires screeching)

185
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,541 
Mike!

186
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,750 
Mike! No!

187
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,750 
No!

188
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,750 
No!

189
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,875 
Mike!

190
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,916 
He took him.

191
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,541 
Sara...

192
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,541 
He took our son.

193
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,625 
Come back to me. Come

194
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,625 
back to me, sweetheart.

195
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,916 
Come back to me.

196
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,291 
We got to stay

197
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,291 
focused, all right?

198
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,375 
This is not over.

199
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,375 
Not by a long shot.

200
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,708 
Where's Linc?

201
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,708 
What?

202
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,833 
We got to find Linc, okay?

203
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,041 
We're gonna find Linc.

204
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,875 
Linc.

205
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,708 
SARA:

206
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,708 
Oh my God.

207
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,875 
Linc. Linc.

208
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,125 
♪ ♪

209
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,958 
I let you down, Michael.

210
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,375 
I should have taken care of Luca

211
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,375 
when I had the chance.

212
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,333 
You didn't let me down.

213
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,333 
You couldn't have known.

214
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,916 
We're so close

215
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,916 
because of you, Linc.

216
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,375 
You got me home.

217
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,666 
You got me home.

218
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,333 
They've stabilized him,

219
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,333 
Michael.

220
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,833 
There's nothing we can do.

221
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,833 
We've got to get you

222
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,833 
out of here right now.

223
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,583 
(clears throat)

224
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,166 
Okay, you got to give me

225
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,166 
some direction here, you know?

226
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,875 
Some, um...

227
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,458 
fatherly advice

228
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:26,208 
on how to deal with having

229
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:26,208 
a father that's, um...

230
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,416 
you.

231
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,166 
Well, you know, uh...

232
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,708 
Is this blood freaking you out

233
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,708 
like it's freaking me out?

234
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,333 
Yeah, yeah. Let me, uh...

235
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,666 
Scofield said that it would

236
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,666 
deliver me. Both of us.

237
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,833
{\an8}All I have to do

238
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,666 
is just get it to him

239
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,208 
to understand why.

240
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,416
{\an8}So I can finally

241
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,416 
understand this.

242
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,625 
(sniffs)

243
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,708 
He give you this?

244
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,208 
"By your hand, you shall know

245
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,666 
the glories of your progeny..."

246
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,125 
I-It's, it's...

247
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,625 
It's "progeny," dear boy.

248
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,250 
"Progeny.

249
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,666 
And our world

250
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,666 
will be made right forevermore."

251
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,791 
Originally, I thought it

252
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,791 
was a religious thing.

253
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,041 
You know, son of God,

254
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,041 
and all that.

255
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,875 
But now I know it's...

256
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,583 
it's my own progeny.

257
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,666 
(laughs)

258
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,875 
You.

259
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,500 
(chuckles)

260
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,791 
It's a glorious thing indeed.

261
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,958 
Even if I don't have

262
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,958 
a damn clue how to deal with it.

263
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,416 
You and me both.

264
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,125 
MICHAEL:

265
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,125 
I've got a way to get

266
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,875 
our son back, Sara.

267
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,750 
I've been planning

268
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,750 
to bring Jacob down

269
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,583 
ever since he forced me to

270
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,583 
turn my back on you and Mike.

271
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,916 
A plan I had to put on hold

272
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,375 
while I was in that

273
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,375 
Yemeni prison.

274
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,500 
I had to wait

275
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,500 
till I got out.

276
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,083 
Till everything aligned.

277
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,791 
(car approaching)

278
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,125 
Till now.

279
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,000 
Tell me you got something.

280
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,708 
It's eluding me.

281
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,791 
NELSON: There's an even bigger

282
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,791 
code encrypted into the eyes.

283
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,375 
JACOB:

284
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,375 
And what's it say?

285
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,333 
NELSON:

286
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,333 
I don't know yet.

287
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,375 
But with the amount of

288
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,375 
processing power I throw at it,

289
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,125 
we're gonna find out

290
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,125 
real soon.

291
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,625 
What's wrong?

292
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,458 
I-I don't know how to say it,

293
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,458 
so, um...

294
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,666 
That man was

295
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,666 
a police detective,

296
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,458 
and he told me your moth...

297
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,958 
your mother's dead.

298
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,541 
What?

299
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,458 
I know.

300
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,458 
I know.

301
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,833 
But I'm gonna take you

302
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,833 
somewhere safe,

303
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,083 
where those people

304
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,083 
that are trying to hurt you

305
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,625 
can't reach you.

306
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,833 
Why would they try

307
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,833 
and hurt me?

308
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,833 
It's because I love you.

309
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,291 
And they're trying to hurt me--

310
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,708 
take the one thing

311
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,708 
I truly love away.

312
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,041 
Why would they try

313
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,041 
and hurt you?

314
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,166 
Because there are some things

315
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,166 
I haven't told you

316
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,166 
about me.

317
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,916 
I sent that letter

318
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,916 
to you for a reason.

319
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,958 
Poseidon was monitoring

320
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,958 
my communications

321
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,375 
with everyone who could

322
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,375 
possibly be a resource

323
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,666 
or an ally, but not with people

324
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,875 
I despised.

325
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,666 
Give it to me straight--

326
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,666 
how you really feel about me?

327
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,166 
I figured if I showed grace

328
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,166 
to a man

329
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,541 
who'd never seen it before

330
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,541 
in his life,

331
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,541 
maybe he'd be grateful,

332
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,250 
do something for us.

333
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,666 
All of us,

334
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,333 
himself included.

335
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:15,416 
"And our lives shall be

336
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:15,416 
made right forevermore."

337
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,250 
I'm talking about normal,

338
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,250 
everyday life.

339
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,833 
The kind of freedom

340
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,833 
none of us has known

341
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,541 
in a long, long time.

342
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,458 
But Poseidon's not just

343
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,458 
gonna let us go.

344
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,375 
He's got me and your son

345
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,625 
in an iron grip.

346
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,541 
Someone has to make him

347
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,541 
let go.

348
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,000 
Do you understand?

349
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000 
I'm tracking where you're going.

350
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,375 
(chuckles)

351
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,333 
Only way we're gonna get

352
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,250 
that beautiful,

353
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,250 
mundane life

354
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,583 
you're talking--

355
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,583 
any of us--

356
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,958 
is if I take his.

357
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,291 
(chuckles)

358
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,916 
We'll be safe here for now.

359
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,083 
Hey, listen,

360
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,250 
I promised I'd explain.

361
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,083
{\an8}The reason those

362
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,083 
people are after me...

363
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,208 
I know this is gonna

364
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,208 
be hard to believe,

365
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:15,291 
but I'm basically

366
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:15,291 
a secret agent.

367
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,958 
(door unlocks)

368
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,958 
Come on in.

369
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,666 
You know that fort you've got

370
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,666 
in the backyard?

371
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,916 
It feels good to go

372
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,916 
somewhere like that, right?

373
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:43,583 
A place no one knows about,

374
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:43,583 
where no one can get to you.

375
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,458 
Well, that's what

376
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,458 
this place is for me.

377
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,625 
(door unlocks)

378
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,000 
JACOB:

379
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,000 
It's okay.

380
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,250 
It's okay.

381
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,291 
Would you please show him

382
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,541 
your credentials, Agent Blake?

383
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:58,125 
Agent Emily Blake, CIA.

384
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,333 
I'm sorry that had to happen

385
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,416 
in front of you

386
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,416 
at the house.

387
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,208 
She was stationed at the

388
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,208 
house to protect you...

389
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,625 
from exactly the man

390
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,625 
who ended up coming,

391
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,750 
the man who said

392
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,333 
he was your dad.

393
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,083 
Really?

394
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,416 
I've made enemies defending

395
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,416 
America over the years.

396
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,000 
Worst part is that this

397
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,583 
particular one dredged up

398
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,583 
the memory of your father.

399
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,583 
The truth is, Mikey,

400
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,791 
despite what you may want

401
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,791 
to believe, your father died

402
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,458 
seven years ago.

403
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,875 
(cell phone rings)

404
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,541 
Yeah.

405
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,708 
This is Michael Scofield.

406
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,375 
We were just

407
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,375 
talking about you.

408
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,041 
I'm giving you one last chance

409
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,041 
to save your life.

410
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,833 
Hand the boy over

411
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,833 
or I can't be held responsible

412
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,958 
for what happens next.

413
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,125 
Are you threatening my life?

414
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,458 
Only if you don't

415
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,458 
hand him over.

416
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,041 
I'd never hand over my son.

417
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,333 
He's not your son

418
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,791 
and never was.

419
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,750 
Stay away from my dad,

420
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,375 
you hear?

421
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,416 
Stay away!

422
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,666 
(cell phone beeps)

423
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,458 
Good boy.

424
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,875 
He called him Dad.

425
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,583 
Jacob.

426
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,375 
No, he's-he's brainwashing him,

427
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,375 
that's all.

428
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,000 
T-BAG:

429
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,000 
Man like that, you're right.

430
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,916 
He deserves to die.

431
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,375 
Where is he?

432
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,166 
Where is Poseidon?

433
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,416 
He'll be dealt with.

434
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,375 
Wait, hang on, hang on,

435
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,375 
hang on, man.

436
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,833 
If you get caught--

437
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,458 
if he gets caught,

438
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,458 
he's going back to the pen.

439
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,708 
T-BAG:

440
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,708 
Come on, come on.

441
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,708 
I'm not...

442
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,125 
And if I don't do it?

443
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,083 
Criminy, I want you

444
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,083 
free and clear,

445
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,458 
and if that's the

446
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,458 
only way to do it,

447
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,541 
then I got to be

448
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,541 
the one that does it.

449
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,791 
Scofield ain't gonna do it.

450
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,000 
He don't got

451
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,000 
the killing gene.

452
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,375 
No one is getting caught.

453
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,750 
There's a very specific

454
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,750 
order to this.

455
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,125 
MICHAEL:

456
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,125 
Sara, I want you to make sure

457
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,208 
Linc's safe

458
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,208 
and out of harm's way.

459
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,041 
Whip, T-Bag, you're gonna

460
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,041 
collect a wild card for us.

461
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,875 
One that Jacob

462
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,875 
doesn't know is out there.

463
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,208 
I'm gonna go to the nest,

464
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,208 
where this all started,

465
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,125 
where the secrets lay hidden,

466
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,333 
and where blood will finally be

467
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,333 
spilled in its rightful place.

468
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,833 
JACOB: The call I just got

469
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,833 
from Scofield--

470
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,375 
I want to know

471
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,375 
where it came from.

472
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,958 
Location data

473
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,500 
coming to you right now.

474
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,375 
Middle of nowhere.

475
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,500 
Started moving northeast

476
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,500 
and the phone was shut off.

477
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500 
Maybe tossed.

478
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,500 
(exhales)

479
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500 
You and your damn zoo, Scofield.

480
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500 
I'm gonna find out

481
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500 
once and for all

482
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,250 
what you were really

483
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,250 
doing there.

484
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,666 
What you were really planning.

485
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,541 
And then I'm gonna kill you.

486
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,750 
I know everything about you.

487
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,958 
Even your most mundane actions.

488
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,250 
Like the zoo.

489
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,250 
What's with you and the zoo?

490
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,166 
I had to know everything

491
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,166 
about the man

492
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,208 
who wore his plans

493
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,208 
on his skin.

494
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,541 
In plain sight, yet

495
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,625 
so mysterious.

496
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,916 
(bird squawks)

497
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,583 
The secret to real power

498
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,750 
is to never betray

499
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,750 
your intentions.

500
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,166 
To wear nothing

501
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,166 
on your sleeve,

502
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,250 
and to never let anyone

503
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,250 
see your face.

504
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,875 
I'll always

505
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,875 
be a step ahead of you.

506
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,000 
I can see everything

507
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,000 
in your eyes.

508
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,375 
(phone rings)

509
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,041 
JACOB:

510
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,041 
What?

511
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,708 
I decrypted the code

512
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,708 
from the eyes.

513
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,625 
It's a quote

514
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,625 
from Napoleon.

515
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,083 
What quote?

516
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,666 
"Never interrupt your enemy

517
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,708 
when he's making a mistake."

518
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,625 
It's what's behind

519
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,625 
the eyes that counts.

520
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,833 
(phone ringing)

521
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,208 
Yeah.

522
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,416 
Thought you should know

523
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,416 
I'm looking at

524
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,666 
your closed servers right now.

525
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,041 
I'm holding your hard drives

526
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,041 
in my hand.

527
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,041 
All your secret communications.

528
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,875 
Enough to send you away

529
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,875 
forever.

530
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,375 
Bravo, Michael.

531
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,958 
However you got in there, bravo.

532
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,250 
You sent me to the zoo

533
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,250 
so you could get into

534
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,416 
my office.

535
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,416 
But you and I both know

536
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,958 
your threat's a hollow one,

537
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,708 
because you know

538
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,708 
I've got something

539
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,875 
that's even more valuable

540
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,875 
to you: your son.

541
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,750 
So we're back to game theory.

542
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,458 
Do we work together,

543
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,458 
make a trade

544
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,958 
so we both get what we want?

545
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,416 
Or are you gonna

546
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,416 
try something underhanded?

547
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,666 
You know I will.

548
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,416 
As will I. So why don't we

549
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,916 
cut past that and make a deal?

550
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,666 
Sure, Michael. Yeah,

551
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,666 
let's do that.

552
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,708 
Old shipyard.

553
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,041 
Warehouse A.

554
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,375 
5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

555
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,750 
Fine.

556
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,041 
(distant siren wails)

557
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,916 
Uh, excuse me?

558
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,375 
My brother-in-law...

559
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,375 
did-did Lincoln Burrows,

560
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,708 
did he get moved?

561
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,291 
No, ma'am.

562
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,291 
He checked himself out.

563
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,375 
He was down a

564
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,375 
lot of blood.

565
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,375 
I know.

566
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,291 
We tried to stop him,

567
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,291 
but if a patient insists,

568
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,458 
if it's within their power,

569
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,458 
we have to let 'em go.

570
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,791 
Uh, this is

571
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,791 
Dr. Ballard.

572
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,500 
He did the surgery.

573
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,500 
Hi,

574
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,416 
Sara Scofield, I'm an internist,

575
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,416 
actually, up at Ithaca.

576
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,541 
Do you have any idea where my

577
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,541 
brother-in-law might have gone?

578
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,750 
No idea.

579
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,875 
Right.

580
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,000 
What happened

581
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,000 
up in Finger Lakes,

582
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,583 
do you know?

583
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,583 
Another gunshot victim

584
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,375 
came in from

585
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,375 
the same area

586
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,958 
at the same time.

587
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,541 
My brother-in-law was alone.

588
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,541 
It must be a coincidence.

589
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,333 
But thank you.

590
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,125 
Well, I'm heading out.

591
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,125 
I've done what I can.

592
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,000 
He's on life support

593
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,000 
up on three,

594
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,416 
but candidly, I don't think

595
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,416 
he's making it till morning.

596
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,041 
(exhales quietly)

597
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,708 
LINCOLN:

598
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,708 
Luca.

599
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,583 
You had me running there

600
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,583 
for a bit,

601
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,791 
thinking I'd done

602
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,791 
something wrong.

603
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:29,541 
You did.

604
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:29,541 
You stiffed me $100 grand.

605
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,416 
Nah. It's blood money.

606
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,125 
No debts with blood money.

607
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,375 
Say we're clear.

608
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,666 
Eat me, Burrows.

609
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,375 
(grunts)

610
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,958 
(grunts)

611
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,291 
Say we're clear.

612
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,166 
I'm gonna get more guys.

613
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,333 
(coughs) And you're gonna

614
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,333 
be running again.

615
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,583 
(sirens approaching rapidly)

616
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,750 
Not this time.

617
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,458 
LUCA: Are those

618
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,458 
your fake friends again?

619
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,458 
You son of a bitch.

620
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,958 
No. This time,

621
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,750 
they're real.

622
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,875 
(sirens wailing)

623
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,166 
Federal agents!

624
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,916 
Hands where I can see 'em!

625
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,208 
Hands up!

626
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,208 
LUCA:

627
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,208 
Burrows!

628
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,333 
AGENT:

629
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,333 
Do it now!

630
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,875 
Burrows!

631
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,333 
(respirator pumping)

632
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,166 
I need your help.

633
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,458 
I need to

634
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,458 
find my boy.

635
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,916 
Here.

636
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:52,791 
(grunts)

637
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,375 
He's an evil man

638
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,375 
and he's got my son.

639
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,375 
You've got to know someone.

640
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,583 
Something.

641
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:03,541 
Some way I can get my boy back.

642
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:06,875 
(gags)

643
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:09,083 
Please.

644
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,333 
(swallows hard)

645
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,000 
(gags)

646
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,125 
(gags)

647
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,291 
You sure

648
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,291 
this is where my son is?

649
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,541 
Uh-huh.

650
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,583 
Thank you.

651
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,541 
(grunts)

652
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,458 
(swallows hard)

653
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,250 
It's all right.

654
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,291 
T-BAG:

655
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,291 
Killing ain't right.

656
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,500 
WHIP:

657
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,500 
Yeah, I read the Bible.

658
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,708 
T-BAG:

659
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,708 
You did?

660
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,416 
You know, I scanned it once 

661
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,416 
in a hotel room.

662
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,041 
Well, what you gonna do?

663
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,625 
Don't kill anybody unless

664
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,625 
they really deserve it.

665
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:09,875 
Yeah, you must've read

666
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:09,875 
the Old Testament part.

667
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,375 
An eye for an eye,

668
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,375 
a tooth for a tooth.

669
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,458 
Sure, whatever.

670
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,791 
Yeah, I'm just saying,

671
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,416 
sometimes, certain--

672
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,416 
certain sons of bitches,

673
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,333 
they just need to be

674
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,333 
plain old eradicated.

675
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,041 
Mm-hmm.

676
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,041 
World's just better

677
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,041 
minus them.

678
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,958 
Like Abu Ramal.

679
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,375 
But for the most part,

680
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,375 
you know, killing's just bad.

681
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,958 
Yeah, absolutely.

682
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,333 
Except Poseidon.

683
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,333 
(sighs)

684
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,916 
Yeah, he's got to go, too.

685
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,916 
Got to go.

686
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,333 
I just don't want you

687
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,333 
to get the wrong idea

688
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,583 
about me, okay?

689
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,583 
Okay.

690
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,666 
You got to see it

691
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,666 
like the yogis, okay?

692
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,875 
Destroying the negative

693
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,875 
to create the positive.

694
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,833 
The dance of the Shivas

695
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,833 
and all that.

696
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,291 
Murder the dark, so the--

697
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,291 
the light can be born.

698
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,791 
You're out of your

699
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,791 
damn tree, aren't you?

700
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,750 
Now you know

701
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,750 
where you got it from.

702
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,750 
Great.

703
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,041 
T-BAG: Is there a

704
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,041 
BlueHawaii in there?

705
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,291 
BLUEHAWAII: Yeah, don't

706
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,291 
just dillydally, come on in.

707
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:59,666 
I assume you two desperados

708
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:59,666 
are Scofield's guys.

709
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,458 
Yeah.

710
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,291 
He get you out of prison, too?

711
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,500 
T-BAG:

712
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,500 
No.

713
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,958 
But I do owe him.

714
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,625 
Where'd he break you out of?

715
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:12,000 
Barranquilla, South America.

716
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000 
They were gonna eat my lunch

717
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000 
down there,

718
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000 
pretty boy like me.

719
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,166 
Scofield took pity.

720
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,458 
Saw a talent in me, I guess.

721
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,458 
Got me out.

722
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,500 
Said he might call on those

723
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,500 
talents some day in return,

724
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,791 
and now here we are.

725
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,500 
Soon as I put

726
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,500 
the touches on this,

727
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,250 
I'm yours. Got bored waiting.

728
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,875 
It's incredible.

729
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,583 
Rebuild of Dealey Plaza,

730
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:39,166 
where JFK was shot.

731
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,041 
This here

732
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,875 
is a book depository.

733
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,291 
WHIP: Attention to

734
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,291 
detail like that,

735
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,416 
drive a man crazy.

736
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:49,291 
Look at me.

737
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:49,291 
I'm a crap house loon.

738
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,708 
Excessive need to bring the past

739
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:53,166 
back to life.

740
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:54,916 
Make it real.

741
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,833 
But enough of that.

742
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,500 
Time for the real dance

743
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,500 
to begin, am I right?

744
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:11,666 
We're going to get

745
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:11,666 
him back, okay?

746
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:14,666 
WHIP: We got your wild card

747
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:14,666 
ready to go.

748
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,666 
MICHAEL:

749
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,666 
Thank you.

750
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,416 
Me that should be thanking you.

751
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:22,791 
You brought me all this way.

752
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,083 
We did it together.

753
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,750 
We'll be doing this together.

754
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:30,291 
You gave me family.

755
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,666 
Seriously, thank you.

756
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,333 
Speaking of family...

757
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,250 
LINCOLN:

758
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,250 
Let's go.

759
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:49,875 
Don't touch that, please.

760
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,500 
It's not an option right now.

761
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,541 
Now where is my son?

762
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:19,291 
You ask questions you know

763
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:19,291 
there isn't a chance in hell

764
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:20,708 
I'm gonna answer.

765
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,500 
So we're back to the game.

766
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,125 
The truth is, we never left.

767
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,708 
You're not holding

768
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,708 
the cards.

769
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,833 
I am.

770
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,833 
Are you?

771
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:31,708 
Every law agency in the

772
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:31,708 
world is looking for you.

773
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,000 
Doesn't sound like a

774
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,000 
position of power to me.

775
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,583 
If I get arrested,

776
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,583 
those servers will be released,

777
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,791 
and everything you've done

778
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,791 
will be exposed.

779
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,750 
I'll find them.

780
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,750 
I'll destroy them.

781
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,166 
Like I said,

782
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:45,333 
I'm holding the cards.

783
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,583 
Whoa!

784
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,333 
Didn't expect that.

785
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,541 
It's beneath you, Michael.

786
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,208 
Let him go!

787
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:02,208 
Now that, I expected.

788
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,333 
JACOB:

789
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,333 
Thank you.

790
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,250 
(gun clicks)

791
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,208 
WHIP:

792
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,208 
How about we drop it, lady?

793
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,416 
JACOB:

794
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,416 
You don't think

795
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,416 
I expected this?

796
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:12,416 
We could do this all day.

797
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,000 
Play contingency

798
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,000 
after contingency.

799
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,583 
But do you really

800
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,583 
want to do that?

801
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,125 
(gunshot)

802
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,125 
Ah!

803
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,833 
T-BAG:

804
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,833 
No! David. Dammit!

805
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,208 
Back off, or

806
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,208 
I kill him right now.

807
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:24,416 
JACOB:

808
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:24,416 
And that must be

809
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,833 
the last of your

810
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,833 
contingencies.

811
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,833 
Thank you so much for

812
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,833 
showing me, Michael.

813
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,875 
(sirens wailing)

814
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,416 
Oh, yeah.

815
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:33,708 
You should also know

816
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:33,708 
I called the FBI.

817
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:36,208 
An anonymous

818
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:36,208 
tip saying

819
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,458 
that Kaniel Outis

820
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,458 
would be at this warehouse.

821
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,958 
(indistinct radio chatter)

822
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,375 
Keep clear.

823
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,375 
Moving to second position.

824
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:03,791 
JACOB:

825
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:03,791 
Okay,

826
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,791 
they're in the building.

827
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,791 
There's no more time.

828
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,500 
The hard drives,

829
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,500 
or we'll start shooting

830
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,750 
your pieces.

831
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,750 
WHIP: Hand over

832
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,750 
the damn boy!

833
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,750 
Shut up.

834
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,958 
Lady, put the gun down,

835
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,958 
walk away,

836
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,875 
as I cannot be held accountable

837
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,875 
for what's about to happen.

838
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,541 
He moves, shoot him!

839
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,541 
I killed a guy

840
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:19,250 
in a bar fight once.

841
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:19,250 
He was taking yang to my girl.

842
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,833 
Took me one

843
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,833 
second to do it.

844
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,833 
Don't do it!

845
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,541 
You should listen to him.

846
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,541 
He's a very smart man.

847
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:24,583 
I'm talking to you, Whip.

848
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:29,041 
It's not worth dying for.

849
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:29,041 
This is my fight!

850
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,875 
This is our fight. We've

851
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,875 
come too far to let this

852
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:31,750 
son of a bitch win.

853
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,125 
MICHAEL:

854
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,125 
This wasn't the plan!

855
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,000 
Don't do it!

856
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,333 
Some sons of bitches

857
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,333 
just got to go!

858
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:36,583 
We're the only ones

859
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:36,583 
who could do it.

860
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:37,666 
Ain't that right, Pa?

861
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:37,666 
David!

862
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:38,666 
AW:

863
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:38,666 
Try me.

864
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,958 
Whip!

865
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:47,958 
(grunting)

866
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:50,208 
(gunshot, Whip groans)

867
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,625 
No!

868
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:56,875 
Whip. Whip. 

869
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:56,875 
T-BAG: No.

870
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,916 
Come on.

871
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,916 
Whip.

872
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,625 
This wasn't the plan.

873
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,500 
Stay-stay with me.

874
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,916 
Stay with me, boy.

875
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,916 
Stay with me.

876
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:07,166 
JACOB:

877
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:07,166 
The hard drives. Now.

878
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,791 
I got him.

879
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,791 
It's okay, I got him.

880
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,791

1015
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,458 
An office

1016
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,041 
only you have access to.

1017
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,750 
Harlan Gaines' blood.

1018
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,083 
MICHAEL:

1019
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,083 
And blood will finally

1020
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,833 
be spilled

1021
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,833 
in its rightful place.

1022
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,458 
What? How...

1023
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,000 
MICHAEL:

1024
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,000 
These are the missing frames

1025
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,000 
from the night of the killing.

1026
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,500 
The ones Poseidon edited out.

1027
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,666 
Yes, I was there.

1028
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,666 
I've never denied it.

1029
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,666 
He forced me to...

1030
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:55,625 
so he could frame me.

1031
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,041 
So the blood evidence

1032
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,041 
found in your belongings

1033
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,666 
was because he tasked you

1034
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,666 
with disposing of the body.

1035
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:03,541 
Correct.

1036
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:06,166 
And with the revelation of

1037
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:06,166 
the additional blood evidence

1038
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:08,458 
found in his office

1039
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:08,458 
at the university,

1040
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:11,750 
it neatly supports your

1041
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:11,750 
theory, doesn't it?

1042
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,000 
That he was there.

1043
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,750 
That he was the gunman.

1044
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,458 
I guess I would have

1045
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,458 
one question for you.

1046
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,958 
I'm director of the CIA.

1047
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:27,250 
I'm aware of that.

1048
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:27,250 
That's why I sent you the e-mail

1049
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,750 
with the evidence directly.

1050
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,166 
My question is...

1051
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,958 
would you be

1052
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,958 
manipulating me, too?

1053
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,458 
How would I do that?

1054
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:37,666 
Well...

1055
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,833 
you look too closely

1056
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,833

you might find

1060
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,416 
some problems.

1061
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,750 
Depends how motivated you are

1062
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,750

00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,750 
your deputy director.

1065
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,750 
He was a cancer

1066
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,750 
inside your agency for years.

1067
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,541 
I've shown you his face!

1068
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:56,375 
Now, calm down.

1069
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,166 
You should know that we

1070
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,166 
have Mr. Ness' accomplice,

1071
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:02,833 
Andrew Nelson, in custody,

1072
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:05,041 
thanks to your brother.

1073
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:06,541 
Once we saw your e-mail,

1074
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,166 
we interrogated him.

1075
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:10,958 
He's fully disclosed 21-Void's

1076
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:14,083 
conspiracy to frame you for

1077
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:14,083 
the murder of Harlan Gaines

1078
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,708 
and bury your identity

1079
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,708 
by giving you a new one:

1080
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,666 
Kaniel Outis.

1081
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:20,916 
What does that mean?

1082
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:22,583 
It means...

1083
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,416 
...you're free to go,

1084
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,416 
Mr. Scofield.

1085
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,125 
You don't know

1086
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,125 
how long I've waited

1087
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,750 
to hear someone call me that.

1088
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,000 
One other thing.

1089
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,875 
The level of ingenuity

1090
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:56,541 
that you displayed

1091
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:56,541 
with all of this--

1092
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:59,000 
we could use a

1093
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:59,000 
person like that.

1094
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,500 
I am not looking for a job.

1095
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,791 
Right.

1096
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:11,708 
There is one thing

1097
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:11,708

1103
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,750 
Yeah.

Why'd you call her?

1110
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,083 
Because I knew

1111
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,083 
you wouldn't.
