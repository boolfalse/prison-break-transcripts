Psst.

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,333 
(whispers):

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,333 
This is it.

27
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,416 
Whip, get up here.

28
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,666 
MAN:

29
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,666 
Is it happening?

30
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,750 
You are not going

31
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,750 
to leave us, are you?

32
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,666 
If the rebels take

33
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,666 
the city, we're dead.

34
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,666 
MICHAEL: You've told us that

35
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,333 
a thousand times, Sid. You're

36
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,333 
a broken record. Is it clear?

37
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,666 
SID:

38
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,666 
Okay, it's clear.

39
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,250 
Whip. Come on.

40
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,583 
Lights go out...

41
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,583 
(grunts) ...you follow.

42
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,833 
Come on.

43
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,916 
WHIP: Would have made it

44
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,916 
so much easier

45
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,250 
if it was just you and me like

46
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,250 
it was on all the other ones.

47
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,291 
Nothing is easy

48
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,291 
on this one.

49
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,041 
Yeah, tell

50
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,041 
me about it.

51
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,708 
One minute.

52
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,458 
(distant explosions rumbling)

53
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,666 
(sighs)

54
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,000 
Board spans the gap.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,166 
Okay.

56
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,541 
Blanket covers the wire.

57
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,708 
(gasps)

58
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,375 
Now it's about

59
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,375 
those lights going out.

60
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,416 
He didn't flash it

61
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,416 
24 hours before.

62
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,583 
That's supposed

63
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,583 
to be the signal.

64
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,583 
Have faith.

65
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,416 
Seven straight nights?

66
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,500 
No signal, no lights

67
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,500 
getting turned out?

68
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,916 
Those strikes are

69
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,916 
getting closer, too.

70
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,250 
(distant explosion)

71
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,541 
Those lights aren't going out.

72
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,875 
Lights aren't

73
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,875 
going out.

74
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,875 
Got to go back.

75
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,875 
Maybe make a run for it.

76
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,875 
Too much ground to cover.

77
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,875 
They'll shoot us down

78
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,875 
before we make the gap.

79
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,875 
What's the plan then?

80
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,875 
Give up and die?

81
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,458 
I can't wait

82
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,458 
another four years.

83
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,458 
It was supposed to be one week.

84
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,750 
Poseidon has left

85
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,750 
us here to die.

86
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,750 
We still got

87
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,583 
one card left to play.

88
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,916 
I didn't want to play it,

89
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,916 
but it's already in motion.

90
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,791 
(explosion rumbles)

91
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,791 
Let's go.

92
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,458 
C-

94
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,458

97
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,750 
Shortly after, he was captured

98
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,791 
trying to escape, and

99
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,791 
thrown into solitary.

100
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,916 
They just released him

101
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,916 
into gen pop recently.

102
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,458 
Call him Michael, will you?

103
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,583 
But why didn't he acknowledge us

104
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,208 
when he saw us?

105
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,208 
(soft scraping on floor)

106
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,083

Get back here!

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,458 
Kid was spying on us.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,458 
Yeah.

112
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:36,041 
And he left something

113
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:36,041 
under the doormat.

114
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,125

This is Michael's handwriting.

116
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:32,000 
Swan was his calling card.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,208 
He's reaching out to us.

118
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,333 
But why is he being

119
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,333 
so mysterious?

120
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,666 
Back in the day, he never

121
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,666 
talked to you straight, as in

122
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,375 
not in code?

123
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,375 
He's worried about someone

124
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,375 
intercepting his message.

125
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,375 
Yeah, but what does it mean?

126
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,333 
I don't know, but

127
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,333 
we're supposed to know.

128
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,583 
Sheik of Light.

129
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,583 
Sheik of Light.

130
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,041 
That sounds like a guy

131
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,041 
on a mountain peak

132
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,666 
communing with God.

133
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,875 
Yeah, we got to get help.

134
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,208 
We're out of help.

abetting a terrorist.

138
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,875 
Well, then you have

139
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,875 
to convince her that you're not.

140
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,041 
SHEBA:

<i>You have got to leave, Papa.</i>

142
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,291 
I will not run away.

143
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,291 
The government

144
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,291 
is being targeted.

145
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,875 
<i>You </i>are being targeted.

146
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,375 
I'm a no one.

147
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,375 
You are government to them.

148
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,958 
You don't understand

149
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,958 
being a Yemeni.

150
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,875 
(panting)

151
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,041 
You would run away when

152
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,041 
she needs you the most?

153
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:26,083 
I understand that we are no good

154
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:26,083 
to this country dead.

155
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,041 
Papa, there will come a time.

156
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,041 
We go abroad,

157
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,958 
regroup

158
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,958 
with an exile government.

159
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,541 
With what money, girl?

160
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,541 
It would cost

161
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,541 
two years' salary.

162
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:43,625 
I'd rather die with my face to

163
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:43,625 
the enemy than to run away.

164
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,166 
Papa...

165
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,958 
(sighs)

166
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,000 
(knocking at door)

167
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,416 
Hey.

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,416 
SHEBA: I suggest you leave

169
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,625 
this country as quickly

170
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,625 
as you can.

171
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,666 
What's he doing here?

172
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,083 
My friend needs your help.

173
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,625 
I gave him my help.

174
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,125 
You didn't tell me he was

175
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,125 
working with the enemy.

176
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,666 
This man you claim

177
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,666 
is your brother,

178
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,500 
Kaniel Outis,

179
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,500 
worked with the rebels.

180
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,083 
His name's Michael Scofield.

181
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,083 
I don't care!

182
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,916 
Not Kaniel Outis!

183
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,416 
There's nothing you can

184
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,416 
say to me that will

185
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,916 
make me help you, okay?

186
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,625 
Is that right?

187
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,333 
This enough to get your family

188
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,333 
out of the country?

189
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,833 
Deliver me this first.

190
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,875 
(school bell ringing)

191
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,208 
Ready, love?

192
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,541 
(phone chimes)

193
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,833 
MIKE:

194
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,833 
What's that?

195
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,833 
It's, uh... it's

196
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,000 
something your

197
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,000 
Uncle Lincoln sent.

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000 
Here.

199
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000 
I don't want to go.

200
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000 
I want to stay with you.

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,500 
You got to go to school.

202
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,333 
And I'm gonna be right

203
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,333 
here when the bell rings.

204
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,916 
Okay? You walk

205
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,916 
down those steps,

206
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,833
{\an8}you hop straight

207
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,833 
into the car. Yeah?

208
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,666 
I love you.

209
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,000 
Make it a great day.

210
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,000 
LINCOLN (on video):

211
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,000 
<i>I got the note.</i>

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,250 
(gasps)

213
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,833 
<i>I got the note, Michael.</i>

214
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,791 
<i>We're here</i>

215
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,791 
<i>to get you out of here.</i>

216
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,083 
MICHAEL:

217
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,083 
<i>Look, my name isn't Michael,</i>

218
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,250 
<i>and I don't know who you are.</i>

219
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,083 
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

220
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,708 
(phone rings)

221
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,416 
Hey.

222
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,250 
JACOB:

223
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,250 
<i>You know I'm a noted economist?</i>

224
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,916 
<i>I mean, that's what it says</i>

225
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,916 
<i>in the paper.</i>

226
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:14,750 
"Noted Economist

227
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:14,750 
Attacked in Home." (laughs)

228
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,041 
<i>I didn't even know</i>

229
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,041 
<i>economists made the news.</i>

230
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,416 
That's the first and last time,

231
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,416 
hopefully.

232
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:23,958 
(laughs) I've been trying

233
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:23,958 
to piece this thing together.

234
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,416 
You remember

235
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,416 
those government guys,

236
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,916 
those think tank guys,

237
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,166 
<i>trying to pick my brain</i>

238
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,166 
<i>about game theory,</i>

239
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,333 
<i>how they could use it</i>

240
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,333 
<i>for foreign policy?</i>

241
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,583 
Yeah, you bored the hell

242
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,583 
out of 'em, right?

243
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:38,125 
Yeah, okay, but I mean,

244
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:38,125 
did I hear something

245
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,416 
<i>I shouldn't have? </i>

246
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,416 
I don't know. Did you?

247
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,000 
<i>Like who shot JFK?</i>

248
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,291 
(laughs)

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,291 
I am trying to be serious here.

250
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,833 
No, you're doped up

251
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,833 
on painkillers

252
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,583 
and you're thinking too much.

253
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,958 
I promise

254
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,958 
this has nothing to do with you.

255
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,416 
You rest. I'm going to, um...

256
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,333 
I'm gonna run some errands,

257
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,250 
and then I'm gonna

258
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,250 
come visit you, okay?

259
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,625 
<i>Okay. Love you.</i>

260
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,750 
Love you, too.

261
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,958 
Okay, no problem. Thanks.

262
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,958 
Hi. I, uh, I called earlier

263
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,958 
about a missing U.S. citizen

264
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,291 
in the Middle East.

265
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,291 
Yes. I'm Henry Kishida.

266
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,625 
Let me walk you

267
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,625 
to the director's office.

268
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,500 
It's an unusual

269
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,500 
situation,

270
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,833 
which you can appreciate,

271
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,291 
since your husband

272
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,291 
is declared legally dead,

273
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,625 
and the person that

274
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,625 
you're referring to

275
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,041 
goes by another name.

276
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,291 
KELLERMAN: I'll take it

277
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,291 
from here, Henry.

278
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,291 
How are you, Sara?

279
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,708 
Kellerman?

280
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,875 
I'll leave you two be. Let me

281
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,875 
know if you need anything, sir.

282
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,916 
Mm-hmm.

283
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,916 
Sorry, how did I

284
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,208 
end up with you again?

285
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,208 
You asked

286
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,208 
for the State Department's help.

287
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,750 
I wanted the State Department,

288
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,750 
not you.

289
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,541 
Yeah, you've lived

290
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,375 
so many lives, I don't

291
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,375 
know who you are.

292
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,625 
That'd be a consistent theme

293
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,625 
for you, wouldn't it, given that

294
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,375 
you were married to a man

295
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,375 
who never existed?

296
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,291 
What is that

297
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,291 
supposed to mean?

298
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,708 
It means you should come in

299
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,708 
and let me enlighten you

300
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,875 
to all things

301
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,875 
Michael Scofield...

302
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,958 
Or should I say Kaniel Outis?

303
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,708 
<i>You shouldn't drink</i>

304
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,375 
bottled water-- the dioxins,

305
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,375 
the BPAs in there...

306
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,750 
I'm touched by your concern.

307
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,916 
Have a seat.

308
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,125 
Good, thank you.

309
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,416 
You know, Sara...

310
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,416 
(clears throat)

311
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,791 
...you and I have...

312
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,791 
a checkered past.

313
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,333 
But I am evermore

314
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,333 
a boring guy now, and...

315
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,166 
mellowed by life,

316
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,166 
trust me.

317
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,750 
If you have something

318
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,750 
you want to tell me

319
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,583 
about Michael,

320
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,583 
I'd sure love to hear it.

321
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,958 
Okay. When your call came in

322
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,750 
and Kishida processed it...

323
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,083 
well, let's just say

324
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,083 
there are certain keywords

325
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,833 
that get our system buzzing

326
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,833 
pretty quickly.

327
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,500 
Kaniel Outis...

328
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,750 
Actually, can't stand it

329
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,500 
watching you drink

330
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,500 
out of that.

331
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,125 
Hey, Kishida?

332
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,500 
Could you bring Sara a glass

333
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,500 
for her water, please?

334
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,583 
Thank you.

335
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,916 
Kaniel Outis...

336
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,250 
is a known terrorist,

337
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,958 
ties to ISIL,

338
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,958 
wanted in the killing

339
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,250 
of a senior CIA official.

340
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,958 
Michael's no killer.

341
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,958 
You see,

342
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,333 
that's the problem.

343
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,375 
Because Kaniel Outis is.

344
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,541 
Thank you.

345
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,625 
KISHIDA:

346
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,625 
You're welcome.

347
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,000 
And...

348
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,125 
this is Kaniel Outis.

349
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,708 
That's ridiculous.

350
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,708 
KELLERMAN:

351
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,708 
The record here at State says

352
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,458 
that... that's

353
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,458 
Kaniel Outis's face.

354
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,458 
Okay,

355
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,666 
but you and I both know

356
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,666 
who Michael Scofield was.

357
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,833 
No, that's just a memory.

358
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,791 
The official record-- history--

359
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,333 
it says otherwise now.

360
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,791 
Now, that's scary, to think

361
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,791 
who could be behind that.

362
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,833 
Because only somebody

363
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,833 
very formidable

364
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,875 
would be capable

365
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,500 
of officially turning

366
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,500 
one man into another.

367
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,458 
It would take a genius...

368
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,458 
like Michael.

369
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,625 
You're insinuating

370
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,625 
that <i>he </i>did this?

371
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,500 
He disappeared,

372
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500 
just quit on his life?

373
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,041 
I want answers just like you do.

374
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,333 
Who's capable of this?

375
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,333 
Only a handful of people

376
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,333 
in the world.

377
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,833 
Sara? Sara!

378
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,833 
I figure we got

379
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,833 
a day, maybe two,

380
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,541 
tops, to get out

381
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,541 
of this hole.

382
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,000 
(explosion)

383
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,833 
At that point,

384
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,666 
either the shelling gets us...

385
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,500 
or ISIL does.

386
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,000 
Does any of this

387
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,000 
faze you at all?

388
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,583 
The fact that we're

389
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,583 
gonna die in here?

390
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,833 
We're not gonna die.

391
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,833 
We're still getting out.

392
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,083 
All of us.

393
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,708 
How's that? The roof?

394
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,916 
The roof ain't happening.

395
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,916 
The roof is happening.

396
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,916 
We don't have time to come up

397
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,916 
with another escape plan.

398
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,875 
So you <i>are </i>nervous.

399
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,625 
Great, now I know

400
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,625 
I'm in deep crap.

401
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,333 
I'm only doing this

402
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,333 
for the money.

403
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,458 
Don't think you and I

404
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,458 
are suddenly good.

405
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,875 
You just deliver

406
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,875 
me the sheik.

407
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,541 
The sheiks are

408
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,541 
well away from here.

409
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,250 
High desert.

410
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,041 
And I've never

411
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,041 
heard of one

412
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,541 
being referred to

413
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,541 
as Sheik of Light.

414
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,041 
Which means it's

415
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,041 
probably a code.

416
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,875 
She knows your brother.

417
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,375 
This tape--

418
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,083 
it's the only thing

419
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,083 
that doesn't belong.

420
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,083 
Your brother speaks

421
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,083 
in riddles,

422
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,000 
does he?

423
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,000 
Maybe it's Braille

424
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,125 
or, uh, Morse.

425
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,583 
Or just numbers.

426
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,458 
(speaking Arabic)

427
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,916 
I think it's a phone number.

428
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,625 
(line ringing)

429
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,916 
Voice mail.

430
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,958 
Mohammad El-Tunis.

431
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,083 
Director of Electrical Works

432
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,083 
in Sana'a.

433
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,750 
Director of Electrical Works.

434
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,583 
"Sheik of Light."

435
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,625 
C-
436
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,625 
<i>the time to see us.</i>

437
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,500 
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

438
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,625 
SECURITY GUARD: <i>They are fleeing</i>

439
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,625 
<i>ahead of the advance.</i>

440
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,333 
We have been trying

441
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,333 
to reach him.

442
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,375 
All we know is that

443
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,375 
he went to the suburbs

444
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,333 
to try to find

445
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,333 
his daughter.

446
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,708 
Do you have an address for her?

447
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,125 
We tried calling her,

448
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,125 
but no answer.

449
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,333 
Address is here.

450
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,458 
You are not going to try

451
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,458 
to find him, are you?

452
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,791 
God be with you, then.

453
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,666 
Circled the address.

454
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,958 
Good luck.

455
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,625 
You're coming with us.

456
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,208 
If you think I'm going

457
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,208 
into the suburbs,

458
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,500 
you're crazy.

459
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,041 
What's wrong with the suburbs?

460
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,500 
The suburbs

461
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,500 
are out there.

462
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,208 
The front line of the war.

463
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,333 
Nice knowing you,

464
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,333 
Benjamin.

465
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,708 
I hope next time

466
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,166 
it's under

467
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,166 
better circumstances.

468
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,000 
Pay up.

469
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,000 
You have to get us

470
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,000 
past the checkpoint.

471
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,833 
Two Americans-- we'll never

472
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,833 
make it without you.

473
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,166 
I am not getting myself killed.

474
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,416 
Pay up.

475
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,166 
Deliver the sheik.

476
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,833 
Then you get your money.

477
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,500 
(mutters in Arabic)

478
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,750 
Get in.

479
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,875 
(phone rings)

480
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,083 
Yes?

481
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,041 
KELLERMAN: <i>You should check</i>

482
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,041 
<i>your e-mail, Sara.</i>

483
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,958 
What am I looking at?

484
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,041 
Footage captured by

485
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,041 
a hunter four years ago.

486
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,416 
One of those motion sensor

487
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,416 
devices you hang on trees,

488
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,541 
takes intermittent

489
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,541 
photos of prey.

490
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,541 
<i>Hunter comes out one morning,</i>

491
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,541 
<i>finds these images.</i>

492
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,250 
<i>This is the killing</i>

493
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,250 
<i>I was telling you about.</i>

494
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,916 
<i>The victim's Harlan Gaines,</i>

495
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,916 
<i>Deputy Chief of the CIA.</i>

496
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,625 
<i>And the killer...</i>

497
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,083 
well, you can see,

498
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,083 
<i>it's who we call</i>

499
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,083 
<i>Michael Scofield,</i>

500
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,250 
<i>or Kaniel Outis, or... </i>

501
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,250 
This is exactly what they

502
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,250 
did to Lincoln.

503
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,416 
And then there's the blood

504
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,416 
evidence the next day.

505
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,833 
Kaniel or Michael or whatever

506
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,833 
gets on a flight to Yemen.

507
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,958 
We all most nail him

508
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,958 
when he lands.

509
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,250 
He gets away.

510
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,750 
His luggage doesn't,

511
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,083 
and Gaines' blood is all

512
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,083 
over the clothes inside.

513
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,916 
<i>The evidence is overwhelming.</i>

514
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,750 
<i>Whatever name</i>

515
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,750 
<i>you want to call him,</i>

516
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,250 
<i>Michael's a murderer, Sara.</i>

517
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,500 
Hey.

518
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,166 
Are you all right?

519
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,208 
<i>You </i>all right?

520
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,833 
Oh, this old thing?

521
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,541 
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

522
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,166 
What's going on?

523
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,041 
I need your advice.

524
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,708 
It's probably something

525

564
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,125 
Identity theft.

565
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,625 
Apparently he used to

566
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,625 
sit on his couch,

567
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,916 
hack high net worth accounts

Freddy Mercury's ashes.

00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,083 
The story is Freddy's cremated,

576
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,083 
but his ashes go missing.

577
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,416 
To this day no one knows

578
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,416 
where they are.

579
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,583 
Ja admitted to me once

580
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,583 
when he was high he bought them.

581
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,458 
Two million bucks.

582
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,625 
He's got Queen's lead singer

583
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,625 
in his family room.

584
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,291 
How exactly do you

585
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,291 
know all this?

586
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,875 
I asked him.

587
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,291 
He's a real mensch when

588
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,291 
he's not in withdrawal.

589
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,958 
I didn't know

590
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,958 
you talked to him.

591
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,541 
Amazing.

592
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,625 
Just when I think

593
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,625 
I know your game, I don't.

594
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,125 
You know my game, Whip.

595
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,625 
See, right there, "Whip."

596
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,291 
I don't even know

597
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,291 
why you call me that.

598
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,791 
Because you're my whip hand.

599
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,458 
My ace in the hole.

600
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,125 
Yeah, sure, okay.

601
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,291 
JACOB: <i>See, in game theory,</i>

602
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,291 
<i>it serves you to be two-faced.</i>

603
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,958 
Be everyone's friend

604
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,458 
till the moment you're not.

605
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,166 
You make them love you so much

606
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,166 
that when they're up against it,

607
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,458 
their loyalty

608
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,458 
will make them act

609
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,291 
against their own

610
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,291 
best interests.

611
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,666 
That's game theory.

612
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,833 
A cold, rational

613
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,833 
focus on winning.

614
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,583 
Even if it's at

615
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,583 
everyone else's expense.

616
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,500 
What I'm trying to understand

617
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,500 
is what he stands to gain.

618
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,000 
Leaving his family,

619
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,708 
and-and the new identity.

620
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,333 
According to the little you've

621
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,333 
told me, he was different.

622
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,541 
Always an agenda, right?

623
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,416 
Yeah.

624
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,833 
I mean, he apparently loved you.

625
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,208 
Of course he loved you.

626
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,750 
How could he not?

627
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,666 
But he also wanted you

628
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,666 
to open that door

629
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,875 
in the prison for him.

630
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,833 
I mean, true game theory,

631
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,833 
everything, everyone

632
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:13,708 
<i>is a contingency.</i>

633
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,375 
<i>You meet people,</i>

634
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,375 
<i>you bring them into your life</i>

00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,708 
<i>and you keep them percolating</i>

636
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,708 
<i>until the moment</i>

637
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,875 
<i>you need to manipulate the</i>

638
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,875 
<i>relationship to your advantage.</i>

639
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,916 
I'm not judging, you know?

640
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,916 
That's not my thing.

641
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,791 
I know.

642
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,791 
You know me. But...

643
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,916 
...schema as deep

644
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,916 
and as calculating

645
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,916 
as that can, in the end,

646
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,291 
spin a man off into madness.

647
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,625 
He might initially think

648
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,625 
smaller evils are okay

649
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,458 
in the service

650
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,458 
of a greater good.

651
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,041 
Like breaking Lincoln out

652
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,041 
of prison.

653
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,041 
But the dance of good and evil

654
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,041 
could become jumbled,

655
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,041 
and the manipulation

656
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,041 
itself becomes

657
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,875 
the most important thing.

658
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,833 
Becomes about winning

659
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,750 
rather than whether the game

660
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,750 
should be won at all.

661
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,750 
I don't think I've seen you

662
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,750 
this scared before.

663
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,291 
They say, for Ramadan, as an act

664
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,750 
of forgiveness,

665
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,750 
they're going to release

666
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,625 
all prisoners from

667
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,625

668
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,583

669
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,583 
population.

670
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,083 
Worst of the worst.

671
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,750 
ISIL fanatics.

672
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,250 
Abu Ramal.

673
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,250 
They're going to kill me,

674
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,250 
you know.

675
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,833 
Government

676
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,833 
gave me 20 years

677
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:41,458 
for homosexuality.

678
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,166 
But the monsters in there,

679
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,541 
Ramal and his men,

680
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,125 
won't let me live 20 minutes.

681
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,583 
Please tell me

682
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,125 
you still plan

683
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,125 
on getting us out of here.

684
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,291 
You were responsible

685
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,291 
for killing the lights,

686
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,291 
and then your Sheik of Light

687
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,291 
went missing

688
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,708 
at exactly

689
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,708 
the wrong time.

690
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:04,291 
I don't know what

691
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:04,291 
happened to him.

692
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:07,791 
Maybe I can find another way.

693
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,666 
There is something

694
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,666 
you could do.

695
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,458 
Give me a piece

696
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,458 
of that gum.

697
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:15,041 
Piece of gum is going

Sometimes, my friend, I

can't tell which is bigger,

you calling me a liar.

Finally find God?

Not your God.

Your ISIL friends

I'm burning up.

845

You should have

846
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,875 
thought about that

847
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:53,375

good men.

850
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,708

a misunderstanding.

856
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,750 
Was it also

857
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,750 
a misunderstanding

858
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,208 
when you tried to escape

859
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,208 
the moment

860
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,541 
you got into this prison? Hmm?

861
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:11,250 
(groans)

862
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,708 
An honest man doesn't

863
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,708 
try to escape.

864
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:16,916 
He asks for a lawyer.

865
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:16,916 
But you,

866
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,916 
you tried to escape

867
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,916 
the very first week.

868
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:28,458 
I'd have left you in solitary

869
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:28,458 
forever if it was up to me.

Anything easy

887
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:33,541 
in this country?

888
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,958 
The question is:

889
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,958 
is the sheik even inside?

890
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:39,083

No. But you're

We are here to get you out.

Not without my daughter.

909
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,708 
We can bring her. Where is she?

910
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,375 
She's out there.

Pinned since ISIL arrived.

00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,375 
I came to get her out.

916

They can stay here for now.

who you know in Ogygia

to educate girls.

1018
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,375 
And my son,

1019

he falls in love

1020
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:56,041 
with another man.

1021
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,750 
They gave him 20 years

1022
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,750 
in Ogygia Prison.

1023
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:03,083 
I went to visit him

1024
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:03,083 
a few weeks ago.

1025

00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:08,208 
<i>A way I could help.</i>

1028
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:09,625 
<i>A man is not a man</i>

1029
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:12,416 
<i>if he would let his family die.</i>

1030
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,375 
You agreed to help him.

1031
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,708 
How?

1032
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:19,208 
He said if I could

1033
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:19,208 
arrange a blackout,

1034
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:21,791 
he... he knew someone

1035
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:21,791 
who could get him out.

1036
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:22,916 
An American?

1037
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:24,625 
I don't know.

1038
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:27,083 
I-I was supposed to

1039
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:27,083 
do this a week ago,

1040
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:30,583 
but then this happened

1041
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:30,583 
with my daughter.

1042
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:31,958 
Thank God you found us.

1043
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,375 
There's still

1044
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,375 
time to do it.

1045
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:36,416 
They're waiting for you

1046
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:36,416 
in there.

1047
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,916 
Then I have to go now.

1048
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,000 
He said I was

1049
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,000 
to give a signal

1050
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,250 
exactly 24 hours

1051
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,250 
before the blackout.

1052
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,500 
I will pulse

1053
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,500 
the power grid twice.

1054
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,083 
This city

1055
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,083 
may not have 24 hours in it.

1056
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:58,458 
(school bell rings)

1057
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,458 
TEACHER:

1058
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,458 
Bye, guys.

1059
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:01,458 
Bye.

1060
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:05,958 
God knows I'm no perfect

1061
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:05,958 
judge of character,

1062
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,916 
but Michael?

1063
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,916 
(chuckles)

1064
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:11,583 
If any of what they're

1065
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:11,583 
saying is true...

1066
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,625 
So there's more

1067
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,625 
to find out, Sara.

1068
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:17,291 
I mean, the important thing is

1069
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:17,291 
that you are gonna survive this,

1070
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,375 
however it turns out.

1071
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:20,708 
Mm-hmm.

1072
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:23,458 
And we're here for you. Okay?

1073
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:24,791 
Let's go.

1074
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:24,791 
Thank you.

1075
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:25,833 
Call me, okay?

1076
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,333 
Yeah.

1077
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,000 
Hey, can I just scoop

1078
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,000 
Mike real quick?

1079
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,291 
All the kids have been released.

1080
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,875 
You don't have him?

1081
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,125 
Mike?

1082
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:40,875 
I'll go this way.

1083
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:40,875 
Okay, yeah.

1084
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,833 
Mike?

1085
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:47,375 
Hey, hey, have you seen Mike?

1086
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,625 
Mike!

1087
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,458 
Mike!

1088
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:55,041 
Mike!

1089
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,958 
(panting):

1090
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,958 
There...

1091
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,666 
What are you doing?

1092
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,666 
You scared me.

1093
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,416 
I was looking

1094
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,416 
for where the man went.

1095
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,583 
What man, baby?

1096
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,000 
The man that gave me this.

1097
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,541 
The pizza man.

1098
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:08,375 
The pizza man?

1099
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,166 
(whispering):

1100
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,166 
Michael.

1101
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,166 
What are you into?

1102
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,250 
ISIL is getting

1103
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,250 
closer by the hour.

1104
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,666 
And the rebels

1105
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,666 
in here know it.

1106
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,833 
When they take over,

1107
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,833 
they'll kill all of us.

1108
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:40,083 
Infidels, the sinners,

1109
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:40,083 
the foreigners.

1110
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:52,125 
Praise Allah.

1111
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,375 
Someone found my father.

1112
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,875 
Means the escape is on.

1113
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,041 
24 hours from now.

1114
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,625 
(door opens)

1115
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,708 
But this may be too late.

1116
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:07,541 
Ramadan has begun.

1117
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,708 
The guards are releasing

1118
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,708 
the prisoners.

1119
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:13,708 
Abu Ramal and his men,

1120
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,416 
they'll kill me.

1121
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:17,208 
And you.

a way out for us?

Yes. Tomorrow night.
