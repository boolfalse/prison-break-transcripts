00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,541 
Sorry.

180
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,541 
No!

181
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,625 
When a man...

182
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,000 
...mounts another man...

183
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,791 
...the throne of God shakes.

184
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,375 
Ramal!

185
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,166 
(grunting, groaning)

186
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,541 
You bastards!

187
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,541 
Let him go!

188
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,375 
Ramal!

189
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,958 
(groaning)

190
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,000 
(quietly):

191
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,000 
What are you doing?

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,166 
Stay out of this.

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,166 
No.

194
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,666 
The escape is tonight.

195
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,208 
If you want to get out,

196
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,208 
you need me and you need him.

197
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,625 
ABU RAMAL:

198
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,625 
Get to the point.

199
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,708 
Let him go, Ramal.

200
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,000 
(grunting)

201
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,333 
Then I'll do it.

202
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,166 
Do not touch him.

203
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,500 
Get back, dog!

204
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,083 
(indistinct yelling)

205
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,375 
There will be no killing

206
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,375 
in this prison. Understand?

207
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,583 
AW: <i>He's tried</i>

208
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,583 
<i>to contact her before.</i>

209
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,416 
VAN GOGH:

210
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,416 
<i>Only difference is</i>

211
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,416 
<i>he succeeded this time.</i>

212
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,208 
It's smart...

213
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,208 
going through the boy.

214
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,833 
Ask a question?

215
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,208 
Why are we pulling

216
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,208 
our punches with this woman?

217
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,750 
I got sent to her house

218
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,750 
a couple of days ago,

219
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,666 
started spilling blood,

220
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,666 
but I'm just supposed to stop

221
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,958 
before I start spilling hers.

222
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,458 
How's that work?

223
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:01,250 
You'll get used

224
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:01,250 
to Poseidon's game.

225
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,875 
It's all chess.

226
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,250 
It's a performance.

227
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,791 
A performance designed to

228
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,791 
make Outis reach out to her.

229
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,833 
Now all we got to do

230
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,833 
is listen in,

231
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,333 
find out what his plans are.

232
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,458 
And she doesn't know it,

233
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,458 
but she's the one that's

234
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,458 
going to lead us to him.

235
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,750 
They said I can

236
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,750 
go in the morning.

237
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,708 
Your femoral artery

238
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,708 
was severed.

239
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,291 
That's not something you usually

240
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,291 
just get up and walk away from.

241
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,625 
Hey, they gave me the okay.

242
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,458 
They're the doctors

243
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,458 
on this one, not you.

244
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,541 
And I'm going full mental

245
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,541 
in here, so I'm gonna go.

246
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,333 
Okay. How about this?

247
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,708 
When you are discharged,

248
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,250 
why don't we go up to your

249
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,250 
parents' lake house?

250
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,000 
I'll just pick you up

251
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,000 
with Mike and we'll go.

252
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,625 
Mmm.

253
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,416 
You don't want to be

254
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,416 
in the house, do you?

255
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,250 
Somebody comes into your house

256
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,916 
and shoots up your husband

257
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,916 
and they're still out there.

258
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,291 
No.

259
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,958 
(chuckles)

260
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,958 
What?

261
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,958 
No, it's just something

262
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,958 
you do with your nose

263
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,166 
when you're determined.

264
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,666 
With my nose?

265
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,666 
It's subtle.

266
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,750 
I mean, it's really subtle.

267
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,750 
Better be.

268
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,791 
The face is amazing.

269
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,625 
I mean,

270
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,833 
the tiniest detail,

271
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,833 
less than a millimeter,

272
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,708 
differentiates

273
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,708 
everything.

274
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,708 
An emotion on one

275
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,708 
person can be...

276
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,458 
so troubled

277
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,083 
and on another...

278
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,125 
...so beautiful.

279
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,583 
You're not trying to get

280
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,583 
somewhere, are you, Mr. Ness?

281
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,458 
Yes, actually,

282
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,708 
I am.

283
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,916 
(chuckles)

284
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,750 
T-BAG:

285
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,750 
Hello there.

286
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,041 
I come as a compatriot, Sara.

287
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,333 
Get out of my way

288
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,333 
or I'll scream.

289
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,875 
Last thing I want.

290
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,833 
For your information,

291
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,958 
I know about Kaniel Outis.

292
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,541 
Tell me what you know.

293
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,791 
The day I hit the bricks

294
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,791 
from Fox River,

295
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,458 
someone named Outis,

296
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,291 
out of the goodness

297
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,291 
of their soul,

298
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,083 
unsolicited, pays

299
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,083 
for this modern prosthesis.

300
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,916 
(T-Bag makes squeaking noises)

301
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,416 
What's that? (squeaks)

302
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,000 
A million bucks?

303
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,000 
Why would anyone

304
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,750 
come out of a pocket

305
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,750 
for a wretch like me,

306
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,958 
a penny, much less

307
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,958 
a million bucks?

308
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,791 
Yeah, if you're coming to me

309
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,791 
for answers, I don't have any.

310
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,416 
Oh, I went looking for answers,

311
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,416 
Doc Sara.

312
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,750 
I looked up Outis

313
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,750 
on the Interwebs.

314
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,250 
Whose face comes up

315
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,250 
but your dead ex-husband's,

316
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,458 
looking very much alive.

317
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,500 
Lazarus arisen

318
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,500 
from the dead.

319
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,125 
He's drawing us into something,

320
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,125 
isn't he?

321
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,708 
He wants something, doesn't he?

322
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,208 
Come near me or my family again,

323
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,208 
I will kill you.

324
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,250 
Better to have me on your side,

325
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,250 
Sara.

326
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,375 
We can figure this out together.

327
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500 
(exhales)

328
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,875 
ZAKAT:

329
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,875 
<i>We have all heard the war</i>

330
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,250 
outside.

331
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,291 
But even if it is just

332
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,291 
within these walls,

333
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:25,333 
the law of the land

334
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:25,333 
is still in place.

335
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,291 
The law of God supersedes

336
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,291 
the law of this corrupt land.

337
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,750 
We will not be reduced

338
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,750 
to animals.

339
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,916 
MAN (whispering):

340
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,916 
Amazing you still trust him.

341
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,458 
He will use you for the

342
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,458 
escape and he will leave you.

343
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,208 
(quietly):

344
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,208 
No one's escaping.

345
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,958 
Who are you?

346
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,958 
(coughs)

347
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,458 
A man who knows

348
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,458 
your friend there

349
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,958 
more than anyone in this prison.

350
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,000 
I was in solitary with him

351
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,250 
for years.

352
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,250 
Yeah, so was I.

353
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,458 
But not in the cell

354
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,458 
across from him.

355
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,916 
He told me about the escape.

356
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,333 
We have to work together.

357
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,333 
No.

358
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,000 
<i>Tried to convince me</i>

359
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,000 
<i>to go with him,</i>

360
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,958 
just the two of us.

361
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,791 
But I told him no.

362
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,958 
I would not leave my brother.

363
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,791 
That is the

364
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,791 
Army in me,

365
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,333 
the Christian in me.

366
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,583 
He is an opportunist.

367
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,041 
He will use whoever he needs.

368
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,750 
He has told you something about

369
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,750 
the escape. I know he has.

370
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,500 
You were in the cell with him.

371
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,500 
You.

372
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,500 
You tell me, so I can help you,

373
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,291 
before he uses you

374
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,291 
to get that devil out

375
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,875 
and we are all

376
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,875 
left here to die.

377
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,750 
(indistinct shouting)

378
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,041 
(automatic gunfire)

379
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,333 
SHEBA: We need passports, Omar.

380
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,333 
You think you can help us?

381
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,125 
LINCOLN: Hold on.

382
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,125 
We're gonna trust this guy?

383
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,208 
He's the one who stole

384
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,208 
my passport in the first place.

385
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,833 
It was honest bargaining,

386
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,833 
friend.

387
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,666 
I took nothing.

388
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,666 
Besides,

389
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,166 
your passport is long gone,

390
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,791 
somewhere far overseas

391
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,791 
by now, I bet.

392
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:03,375 
If you want, um, I can have

393
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:03,375 
the forgers make you another.

394
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,875 
My own fake passport

395
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,875 
coming from you?

396
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,875 
You have another option?

397
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,208 
(distant explosion)

398
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,208 
(rattling)

399
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,416 
Quick. I'm

400
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,416 
leaving the city.

401
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,291 
Nowhere is safe anymore.

402
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,375 
I need two passports.

403
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,375 
One for me,

404
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,208 
one for my brother,

405
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,208 
Michael Scofield.

406
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,541 
$1,000 U.S. each, deposit.

407
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,875 
$1,000 U.S.

408
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,875 
when you pick them up.

409
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,458 
C?

410
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,166 
You screw with me

411
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,166 
and I'll kill you.

412
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,708 
I screw you,

413
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,250 
I won't be around

414
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,250 
for you to kill me.

415
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,291 
11:00 tonight,

416
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,291 
Sheba.

417
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,041 
Passports

418
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,041 
will be ready.

419
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,250 
That means we're gonna

420
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,250 
have to split up.

421
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,333 
You two get

422
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,333 
the passports,

423
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,083 
and I'll go with our friend here

424
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,083 
to the power plant

425
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,541 
and kill the lights.

426
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:55,250 
And we get Michael out.

427
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,416 
REPORTER: <i>A U.S. State</i>

SARA: Hey.

437
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,791 
Looking

438
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,791 
for a smartphone?

439
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,541 
Yeah. You, um...

440
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,791 
you fix phones, too, right?

441
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,166 
Yeah.

442
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,208 
I think somebody

443
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,208 
hacked my cell.

444
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,916 
Whoa.

445
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,375 
Is there any chance

446
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,375 
you can help me figure out who?

447
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,375 
(distant explosions)

448
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,458 
(indistinct chatter)

449
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,625 
The yard is not safe.

450
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,500 
Ten minutes only for food!

451
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,916 
If you're going to eat, eat now.

452
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,541 
I'm not getting killed out

453
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,541 
here so you can fill your guts.

454
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,041 
WHIP:

455
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,041 
That Christian guy said

456
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,541 
you told him you'd just

457
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,541 
take him. No one else.

458
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,375 
He's a liar.

459
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,375 
You don't want anything

460
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,250 
to do with him.

461
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,250 
I don't know.

462
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,250 
Christian, Army.

463
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,166 
Seems pretty up front to me.

464
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,166 
Did he happen to tell you

465
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,791 
about some of the arrests

466
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,791 
he and his brother made

467
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,416 
at their security checkpoint?

468
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,416 
No, focused on you.

469
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,250 
They had a specialty: women.

470
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,291 
Body parts strewn

471
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,291 
around Yemen.

472
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,750 
That's why they're here.

473
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,666 
Wearing a cross

474
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,666 
is one thing.

475
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,291 
Living by it is another.

476
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,291 
All right, okay, sure.

477
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,625 
Just promise me

478
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,625 
I can trust you,

479
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,875 
that we're still

480
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,875 
doing this tonight.

481
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,333 
(distant booming)

482
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,333 
MICHAEL: 

483
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,333 
All these years

484
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,125 
we've been working together,

485
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,041 
you've been able

486
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,041 
to trust me the whole time.

487
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,750 
Last four years in the hole,

488
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,750 
sitting in the dark,

489
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,416 
I couldn't even hear

490
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,416 
a voice. I don't know.

491
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,916 
Maybe something's

492
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,916 
changed or...

493
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,583 
Nothing's changed.

494
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,333 
Poseidon put us in here

495
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,333 
to get Ramal out,

496
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,666 
but then he abandoned us.

497
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,666 
Ramal is Poseidon's guy,

498
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,250 
not ours. He's an animal. 

499
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,250 
I suggest

500
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,583 
you watch your mouth. Some

501
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,583 
of these guys speak English.

502
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,041 
WHIP: Why are

503
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,041 
we still getting him out?

504
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,708 
We're telling him we're getting

505
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,708 
him out. There's a difference.

506
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,416 
We got to act like we're

507
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,041 
on his side until

508
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,041 
the moment we're not.

509
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,375 
But what if you're acting

510
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,375 
like you're on my side

511
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,458 
till the moment

512
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,458 
you're not?

513
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,083 
You are getting paranoid.

514
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,541 
Yeah, well, four years in

515
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,541 
the box is gonna do that to you.

516
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,500 
I'm not leaving you behind.

517
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,708 
You're my whip hand.

518
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,708 
I don't know that.

519
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,500 
How do I know

520
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,500 
I'm your whip hand?

521
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,750 
You'll understand later.

522
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,750 
I want to understand now.

523
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,875 
Okay?

524
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,541 
Get your hands off me.

525
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,958 
Answers, now. I'm serious.

526
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,541 
Okay.

527
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,583 
(grunts)

528
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,916 
I said don't touch me!

529
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,041 
(indistinct chatter, chuckling)

530
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,458 
WHIP:

531
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,458 
Okay. Mm.

532
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,958 
Mm. Okay, that's fair.

533
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,041 
(grunting)

534
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,041 
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

535
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,500 
You want the hole again, huh?

536
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500 
MICHAEL:

537
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500 
No, we're good.

538
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,375 
No.

539
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,375 
We're good.

540
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,750 
We're far from good.

541
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,708 
(indistinct chatter)

542
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:55,083 
By tomorrow, we won't

543
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:55,083 
have to worry about him.

544
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,875 
(speaks inaudibly)

545
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,041 
SHEBA:

546
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,041 
<i>Keep your head down.</i>

547
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,458 
Don't make eye contact

548
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,458 
with anybody.

549
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,041 
A lot of ISIL sympathizers

550
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,041 
everywhere.

551
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,250 
We get our passports,

552
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,250 
we're out of here.

553
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,958 
Understand?

554
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,375 
(indistinct chatter)

555
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,041 
Planning on leaving?

556
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,083 
Right when the glorious

557
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,083 
revolution is beginning.

558
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,375 
I'm not here for political

559
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,375 
discussion, just passports.

560
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,750 
Money first.

561
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,166 
Passports first.

562
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,291 
(sighs)

563
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,000 
LINCOLN:

564
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,000 
They're empty.

565
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,791 
(screams, grunting)

566
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,416 
Sheba!

567
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,416 
(grunting)

568
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,166 
(indistinct shouting)

569
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,833 
(keys jangle, lock clicks)

570
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,875 
I'm sorry I hit you.

571
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,083 
I can explain.

572
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,083 
SID: Can you explain why

573
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,833 
you were going to let that man

574
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,833 
kill me?

575
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,875 
I wouldn't have let him

576
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,875 
kill you.

577
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,083 
You sure seem to be chums

578
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,083 
with the head of ISIL, friend.

579
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,333 
Didn't know you participated

580
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,333 
in these conversations, Ja.

581
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,041 
Only when they're interesting.

582
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,166 
And they're usually not.

583
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,375 
There are people

584
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,375 
in my government,

585
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,083 
believe it or not,

586
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,083 
who want that man out

587
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,500 
for their own convoluted

588
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,500 
foreign policy over here.

589
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,041 
That's the job Whip and I

590
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,041 
were sent here to do.

591
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,291 
But for some reason,

592
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,125 
we were betrayed.

593
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,875 
Which means we're getting out

594
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,875 
without Ramal.

595
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,208 
And every one of you

596
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,208 
is crucial to that plan.

597
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,708 
How?

598
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,458 
Your whole escape's

599
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,458 
already wired.

600
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,708 
Lights out,

601
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,708 
you're over the wall.

602
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,041 
What do you need a Korean junkie

603
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,708 
like me for?

604
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,708 
Korean genius, you mean.

605
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,458 
Getting over that wall

606
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,458 
is just the start.

607
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,291 
Once that happens,

608
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,291 
there are things

609
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,291 
only you can do.

610
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,750 
Back on point: you hit me.

611
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,416 
You wanted proof that I sided

612
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,416 
with you and not Ramal.

613
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,583 
And splitting my lip

614
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,583 
does that how?

615
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,583 
MUSTAPHA: Son of a bitch

616
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,083 
Kaniel Outis keeps

617
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,083 
playing, doesn't he?

618
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,125 
Where is my watch?

619
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,791 
I don't know what

620
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,791 
you're talking about.

621
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,250 
Hmm. You don't?

622
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,750 
I'm going to

623
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,750 
break you in half when I find

624
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,750 
that watch, you know?

625
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,416 
Toss the cell.

626
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,291 
(man coughing,

627
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,291 
indistinct chatter)

628
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,333 
(metallic clinking, rolling)

629
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,875 
It's not here.

630
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,625 
Order a lockdown

631
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,625 
of the whole prison.

632
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,208 
No one gets out of their cells

633
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,625 
until that watch is found!

634
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,000 
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

635
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,875 
Back in your cell!

636
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,291 
Lockdown!

637
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,291 
Get in there!

638
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,750 
Move it!

639
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,875 
I told you, Ramal's not going

640
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,875 
anywhere. Only we are.

641
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,250 
We're gonna be locked in our box

642
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,250 
just like the rest of them,

643
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,083 
only our box has a way out.

644
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,250 
And in two hours

645
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,250 
when those lights go black,

646
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,625 
we're gonna disappear

647
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,625 
from this place like ghosts.

648
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,833 
Yeah, all right.

649
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,166 
(coughs)

650
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,416 
(sighs)

651
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,875 
(groans)

652
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:23,000 
(panting)

653
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,708 
(yelling)

654
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,250 
Sheba!

655
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,458 
(grunting)

656
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,958 
CYCLOPS:

657
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,958 
Who are these men

658
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,958 
you work with?

659
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,750 
They're beneath you.

660
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,541 
<i>You're </i>beneath me.

661
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,458 
(grunts)

662
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,458 
(gasps)

663
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,125 
It pains me to hurt you,

664
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:50,791 
but a good woman

665
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:50,791 
is a humble woman.

666
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,958 
Remember that.

667
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,541 
Who are these men?

668
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,416 
Doesn't matter.

669
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,083 
They're leaving.

670
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,916 
I am not the bad guy here.

671
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,375 
You and I have a history.

672
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,083 
How I doted

673
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:12,041 
on you in grade school,

674
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:12,041 
how I waited and I waited.

675
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,208 
You did not wait.

676
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,791 
You tried to rape me!

677
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,416 
(yells)

678
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,416 
(yells)

679
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,833 
(panting)

680
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,875 
Please.

681
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,500 
(panting)

682
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,250 
Please. Please untie me...

683
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,166 
(panting)

684
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,208 
...so I can take your other eye.

685
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,500 
(yells)

686
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,541 
(door opens, computer beeps)

687
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:46,125 
Afternoon.

688
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,666 
I'm looking

689
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,708 
for a cell phone that

690
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,708 
a woman stole from me.

691
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,125 
She looks like this.

692
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,833 
No, can't help you.

693
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:02,000 
Can't... or won't?

694
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000 
Sorry. Store policy,

695
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000 
that's all.

696
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,083 
STORE OWNER:

697
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,083 
Hey, what are you doing?

698
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,958 
Just... Ow!

699
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,625 
Oh!

700
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,625 
Let's go again.

701
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,750 
Have you seen her?

702
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,750 
(groans)

703
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,666 
(groans)

704
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,666 
Yes. Yes!

705
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,375 
She was here, like,

706
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,375 
ten minutes ago.

707
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,916 
Said her phone was hacked

708
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,916 
and wanted to know who did it.

709
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,875 
And now she knows,

710
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,875 
doesn't she?

711
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,583 
She baited us.

712
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:46,916 
(door squeaks open)

713
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:49,333 
(horns honking,

714
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:49,333 
tires squealing)

715
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,125 
Dead end.

716
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,041 
(panting)

717
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,416 
(gasping)

718
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,666 
(engine revs)

719
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,458 
(sighs)

720
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:41,875 
AW:

721
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:41,875 
Any chance Poseidon'll just

722
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,000 
let us kill her?

723
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,000 
It might come to that.

724
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:55,000 
(panting quietly)

725
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,833 
(loud shouting in Arabic,

726
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,833 
metallic clanking)

727
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,791 
(Ja coughing loudly)

728
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,125 
We get out,

729
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,791 
where are you going?

730
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,791 
Back to my couch.

731
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:16,916 
My couch in Seoul.

732
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:19,791 
Where the walls are mine,

733
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,625 
the floors are mine,

734
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:25,125 
no one can get to me.

735
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,000 
The world stays outside

736
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,000 
like it's supposed to.

737
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,750 
Calgary.

738
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,333 
Canada?

739
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:36,041 
I'm going to be a ski jumper.

740
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:39,333 
You've never <i>seen </i>snow,

741
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:39,333 
have you?

742
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,250 
That's the point.

743
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,875 
Everything in my life

744
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,875 
till now in this country--

745
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:48,458 
the heat, the hate,

746
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:48,458 
the skies that never snow.

747
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:51,125 
You talk about the world.

748
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,208 
I want to be

749
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,208 
on the other side of it.

750
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,708 
JACOB:

751
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,708 
Hey, Dad. Hey, Mom.

752
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,208 
MAN:

753
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,208 
Hi, son. Yeah, Sara,

754
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:10,708 
let me, uh...

755
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:10,708 
Thanks, sir.

756
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,125 
JACOB:

757
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,125 
The house looks great.

758
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,125 
Come on in.

759
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,666 
(phone rings)

760
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,666 
Oh, give me one sec. Sorry.

761
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,375 
DAD:

762
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,375 
When'd you drive up?

763
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,375 
Hello?

764
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:20,000 
<i>Hi. This is Brian at Jep's.</i>

765
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:20,000 
<i>I got this number</i>

766
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,375 
when I activated

767
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,375 
your new phone.

768
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,791 
You never came back.

769
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,625 
I'm sorry. I don't think

770
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,625 
I'm going to.

771
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,333 
Well, okay, I just want

772
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,333 
to let you know that

773
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,708 
I figured out

774
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,708 
who was hacking your phone.

775
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:31,291 
Who?

776
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:33,791 
You... hacked your own phone.

777
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:35,083 
What are you talking about?

778
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,666 
Your thumbprint is your

779
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,666 
password, right? Well,

780
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:40,833 
<i>whoever hacked your phone</i>

781
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:40,833 
<i>used your thumbprint, so,</i>

782
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:44,208 
<i>unless you're missing a thumb,</i>

783
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:44,208 
<i>that's you.</i>

784
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,791 
<i>I don't know what</i>

785
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,791 
<i>you're messed up in,</i>

786
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:46,875 
<i>but I'd watch your back...</i>

787
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:46,875 
<i>(phone beeps off)</i>

788
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,833 
SARA:

789
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,833 
<i>When you were in the hospital,</i>

790
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:54,416 
the woman who attacked us

791
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:54,416 
came back with her partner.

792
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:54,416 
What?

793
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:56,375 
They tracked me down

794
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:56,375 
using my cell phone,

795
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,458 
so I brought it to Jep's

796
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,458 
to try and figure out

797
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,958 
who they were working for.

798
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,958 
Whoa, wait. Sara,

799
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,958 
this has police

800
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,958 
written all over it.

801
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,958 
Police haven't been able

802
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,958 
to do a thing.

803
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,541 
So, what? You went

804
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,541 
to Jep's Electronics

805
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:06,375 
in some hackneyed attempt

806
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:06,375 
at counter-espionage?

807
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:10,125 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

808
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:10,125 
It's just...

809
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,125 
I get you don't

810
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,125 
know where to turn,

811
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,791 
but I got a stake

812
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,791 
in this, too.

813
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:16,583 
Mm-hmm.

814
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:16,583 
Okay? This is

815
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:16,583 
my wife, my son.

816
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,875 
You want to get

817
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,875 
back at these guys?

818
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,666 
The university. I mean,

819
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,666 
it has real resources,

820
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,416 
their computer

821
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,416 
sciences department.

822
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:25,208 
The phone's done.

823
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:25,208 
It's gonna stay at Jep's.

824
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:29,291 
So that's your plan-- just

825
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:29,291 
bury your head in the sand?

826
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,750 
No.

827
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,291 
No, I've learned over the years

828
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,708 
that's exactly

829
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,708 
what you don't do. Thank you.

830
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:43,375 
(phone ringing)

831
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,166 
Which one's this?

832
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,708 
The one you accosted

833
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,708 
in a bathroom.

834
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,541 
<i>(laughing) Oh, that wasn't</i>

835
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,541 
<i>accostment, honey.</i>

836
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:58,583 
I've learned some things

837
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:02,333 
about who it is we're apparently

838
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:02,333 
both looking for?

839
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,125 
But I need to know that you're

840
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,125 
willing to go the distance.

841
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,458 
I'm <i>made </i>of the distance,

842
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,458 
honeysuckle.

843
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,708 
<i>I am the distance.</i>

844
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,958 
Good. Because you're gonna have

845
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,958 
a conversation

846
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,500 
with Paul Kellerman for me.

847
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,083 
Bull. Kellerman's behind this?

848
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,083 
And you are gonna get

849
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,083 
every shred of information

850
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,500 
<i>you can about</i>

851
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,500 
<i>what's really going on.</i>

852
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:26,083 
15 minutes.

853
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:26,083 
(loud, distant shouting)

854
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:29,875 
I'm soiling myself here,

855
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:29,875 
just so you know.

856
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,333 
(sighs)

857
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:40,166 
Look, I'm just gonna

858
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:40,166 
say one thing, okay?

859
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,500 
You're like a brother to me,

860
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,291 
like an older brother.

861
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:47,041 
I'm not much of a brother.

862
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:47,041 
Sure.

863
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:50,291 
Point is I had zero, nobody,

864
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:50,291 
till you recruited me.

865
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,333 
When you pulled me out of that

866
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,333 
prison in the Ozarks, you had

867
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,791 
integrity.

868
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:00,166 
I know we were doing

869
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:00,166 
CIA work, sure,

870
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,916 
you know,

871
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,916 
pulling their people out, but

872
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:04,708 
it was about you and me,

873
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,208 
and having each

874
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,208 
other's back.

875
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:09,041 
And it didn't matter if you

876
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:09,041 
were Ramon Cadena when we did

877
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,666 
the Colombian break,

878
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,666 
or, you know Asaf...

879
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:14,083 
(snaps his fingers)

880
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:14,083 
What was his name?

881
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:16,458 
Whatever. The one in Egypt.

882
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,416 
You were still you.

883
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:22,916 
And it's the same

884
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:22,916 
with this one.

885
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:25,416 
You know, we trump you

886
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:25,416 
up as Kaniel Outis,

887
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,041 
big international

888
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,041 
terrorist.

889
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:31,000 
It's just a name,

890
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,875 
it's just a rap sheet,

891
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,875 
it's a way to get you locked up.

892
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,125 
Right?

893
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,000 
I guess what I'm

894
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,000 
asking you is did...

895
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,541 
did something happen to you

896
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,541 
while you were in solitary?

897
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,708 
Did you become

898
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,708 
Kaniel Outis

899
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:51,791 
in there in your head?

900
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:55,208 
Do you now want Ramal out

901
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:55,208 
after all?

902
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:58,833 
I already told you Ramal

903
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:58,833 
is out of the picture.

904
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,291 
Yeah, you said that,

905
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,291 
but one small thing...

906
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:04,625 
We go up through that hole,

907
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,208 
and then we skirt

908
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,208 
above the block.

909
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:09,791 
Goes right above Ramal's

910
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:09,791 
cell, doesn't it?

911
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,041 
Knock out a couple tiles,

912
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:15,208 
he joins the escape,

913
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:15,208 
doesn't he?

914
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:20,416 
What did you

915
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:20,416 
whisper to him

916
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:22,791 
in that moment

917
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:22,791 
after the fight?

918
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,583 
You whispered something,

919
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,583 
what was it?

920
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:32,083 
Nine minutes.

921
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,708 
How do you know?

922
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,791 
He told me at dinner.

923
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:38,041 
He said he would

924
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:38,041 
come for us.

925
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:41,541 
It's supposed to be only me,

926
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:44,333 
but you will all be coming.

927
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,458 
MAN:

928
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,458 
Open block five.

929
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,875 
(man speaking in Arabic)

930
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,458 
Everyone out.

931
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,791 
Shakedown.

932
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,416 
Got it.

933
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:11,375 
Found it, Mustapha.

934
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:11,375 
It was in the emir's coat here.

935
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,708 
(Cross laughing)

936
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:15,500 
You trusted the liar,

937
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:15,500 
didn't you?

938
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,666 
(continues laughing)

939
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,458 
MICHAEL:

940
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,458 
<i>Now we just pray</i>

941
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,458 
<i>they get the lights out.</i>

942
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,500 
C-
943
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,500 
<i>We got to hurry, man.</i>

944
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,708 
<i>We got less than ten minutes</i>

945
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:29,500 
to kill the power.

946
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500 
Don't worry.

947
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,166 
With luck,

948
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,166 
both your friend and my son

949
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,875 
will be free

950
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,875 
within the hour.

951
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,750 
(electricity powers down)

952
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,500 
Okay, breakers are down.

953
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,125 
Now we just need

954
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,125 
to pull the redundancies.

955
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,666 
They're down the hall.

956
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,458 
I'll stay here and deal

957
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,458 
with security. Go.

958
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,833 
Okay.

959
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,958 
Come on, where are you?

960
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,291 
Ah.

961
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:55,541 
(grunts)

962
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,125 
Oh, come on.

963
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,583 
Oh, when in doubt,

964
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,583 
go old school.

965
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:07,791 
(grunting, electricity crackles)

966
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,583 
(men yelling in Arabic)

967
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:18,000 
Let's go.

968
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,416 
Get the generators up.

969
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,791 
Get these inmates

970
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,791 
back inside!

971
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:24,916 
Now!

972
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:24,916 
(grunting)

973
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,708 
(yelling and clattering)

974
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,416 
Let's go, let's go!

975
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,416 
The weapons,

976
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,416 
get their weapons.

977
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:48,916 
They are trying to

978
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:48,916 
escape without us.

979
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:50,541 
Get to their cell.

980
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:52,875 
Block six.

981
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:52,875 
Come on!

982
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:56,166 
(Abu Ramal calls out in Arabic)

983
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:02,125 
You heard them, brother.

984
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,458 
Block six.

985
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,458 
Yes.

986
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,208 
(whispering):

987
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,208 
Ja, give me your phone.

988
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,875 
Come on.

989
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:12,208 
(grunts)

990
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,958 
Mount flashlights.

991
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,250 
Secure every room.

992
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,916 
Shoot only if you have to.

993
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,916 
And if you do, shoot to kill.

994
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,958 
(men yelling in Arabic)

995
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,291 
(guard groans, Cross grunts)

996
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,833 
(grunting)

997
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,875 
This way.

998
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,083 
A shortcut to block six,

999
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,083 
brother, come on!

1000
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,458 
SHEBA:

1001
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,458 
<i>Get off me, you sick bastard!</i>

1002
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,375 
It's easier if

1003
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,375 
you don't struggle.

1004
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,833 
(grunting)

1005
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,333 
(grunts)

1006
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,750 
(Sheba screams in the distance)

1007
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,708 
(grunting)

1008
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,166 
(Sheba screams)

1009
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:10,875 
(grunting)

1010
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:19,583 
(grunts)

1011
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:19,583 
This is how you treat me?

1012
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,708 
You're going to die now, dog.

1013
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:25,083 
(Lincoln groans)

1014
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,875 
(Lincoln grunts)

1015
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,791 
(both grunting)

1016
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:42,458 
Sheba, Sheba,

1017
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:42,458 
it's me, it's me.

1018
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,500 
Are you okay?

1019
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,791 
(indistinct conversations)

1020
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:55,458 
(phone rings)

1021
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,708 
Linc, talk to me.

1022
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,916 
Get to the rendezvous,

1023
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,916 
the auto shop.

1024
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,125 
We ain't gonna make it.

1025
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,541 
<i>Sheba's busted up real bad.</i>

1026
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,125 
What happened?

1027
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,125 
Just get to the rendezvous.

1028
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:05,791 
<i>We got to be there</i>

1029
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:05,791 
<i>for Michael, damn it!</i>

1030
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,875 
JA:

1031
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,875 
Damn. Lockdown.

1032
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,875 
Extra guards

1033
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,875 
on the roof.

1034
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,875 
Question is whether

1035
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,875 
they move on.

1036
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:18,916 
(men yelling)

1037
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:18,916 
Quickly! Hurry, hurry!

1038
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:20,666 
It's here, this one!

1039
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:23,250 
(whispering):

1040
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:23,250 
We got problems.

1041
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,541 
Guys are trying

1042
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,541 
to get into the cell.

1043
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,541 
Problem.

1044
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:28,041 
What's wrong?

1045
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:28,041 
People coming.

1046
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,291 
Damn it, we got

1047
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,291 
guards up here.

1048
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,541 
Try and buy us

1049
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,541 
some time.

1050
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:32,750 
WHIP:

1051
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:32,750
