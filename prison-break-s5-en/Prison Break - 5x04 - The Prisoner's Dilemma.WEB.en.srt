1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,250 
Hey.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,250 
Hey.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,083 
How you feeling?

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,958 
Body is fine.

5
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,416 
My head is

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,750 
trying to figure out

7
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,750 
how to get those passports

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,333 
we couldn't get last night.

9
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,208 
For you, those kids.

10
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,791 
Well, that's something

11
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,791 
you shouldn't

12
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,250 
be worrying about right now.

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,916 
You should rest up.

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,916 
We're gonna need you.

15
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,583 
I can rest when I'm dead.

16
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:33,208 
Well, that's what

17
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:33,208 
I'm worried about.

18
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,208 
Didn't know you worried.

19
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,208 
About the right things.

20
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,333 
Your brother.

21
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,375 
He make it out?

22
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,750 
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,750 
Yeah.

24
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,208 
Sheba, do you mind if I borrow

25
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,208 
Linc for a second?

26
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,625 
Yeah.

27
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,625 
Okay.

28
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,833 
Please get some rest.

29
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,625 
(indistinct speaking

30
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,625 
over hospital PA)

31
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,291 
Listen. We got

32
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,291 
to start talking

33
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,750 
about leaving the country.

34
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,083 
What are you talking about?

35
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,541 
I spoke to my friends

36
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,541 
at the mosque.

37
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,833 
ISIL is taking

38
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,833 
neighborhoods by the hour.

39
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,708 
If they cut off the

40
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,708 
route to the airport...

41
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:22,750 
I'm not leaving Michael.

42
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,625 
If they cut off the airport,

43
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,625 
no one is getting out.

44
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,416 
Not you, me, Sheba.

45
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:32,458 
As much as it

46
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:32,458 
kills me to say...

47
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:36,041 
we can't risk

48
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:36,041 
all of it for...

49
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,166 
just one man.

50
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,875 
You're right.

51
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:41,875 
You can leave.

52
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,500 
But I can't.

53
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,666 
Get that family to the airport

54
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,666 
as fast as you can.

55
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,000 
I'll work something out.

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,833 
Mr. Burrows?

57
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,625 
I wanted to thank you

58
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,625 
for saving my daughter.

59
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,875 
And offer you something

60
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,875 
in appreciation.

61
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,791 
I might have a solution

62
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,791 
for how to get your brother

63
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,416 
out of that prison.

64
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,125 
(explosion)

65
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,125 
Before the city goes to hell.

66
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,041 
(men shouting)

67
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,083 
You hear that?

68
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,125 
That was the closest one yet!

69
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,750 
100 yards!

70
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,125 
Just when you think

71
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,125 
it couldn't get worse

72
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,833 
locked up in a Porta-Potty,

73
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,500 
they start dropping 2,000-pound

74
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,500 
bombs on the Porta-Potty.

75
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,041 
MICHAEL:

76
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,041 
Whip. Keep it together, please.

77
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,125 
The escape artist is nervous.

78
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,583 
MICHAEL:

79
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,583 
You should be, too.

80
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,500 
Those artillery strikes,

81
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,500 
they don't discriminate.

82
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,666 
The difference is I have faith.

83
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,375 
Allah will deliver me.

84
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,125 
What do you have?

85
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,375 
Ja!

86
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,416 
Ja, are you there?

87
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,416 
I'm here.

88
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,500 
(explosion)

89
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500 
Whip's right.

90
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,625 
The strikes are

91
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,666 
getting closer.

92
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,000 
I pity you.

93
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,666 
I triumph either way.

94
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,875 
Either I will be in paradise

95
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,875 
or Allah will save me.

96
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,291 
You,

97
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,500 
you're just

98
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,500 
going to die.

99
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,833 
(indistinct conversations)

100
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,708 
ISIL has broken through

101
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,708 
the checkpoints.

102
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,833 
They're coming

103
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,833 
into the city.

104
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,083 
These uniforms

105
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,083 
are like targets

106
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,541 
on our backs.

107
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,541 
ISIL isn't here yet.

108
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,458 
The government says

109
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,458 
it will push them back.

110
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,083 
You out of your head?

111
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,083 
This is happening.

112
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,041 
Sana'a is falling.

113
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,125 
They're going to retreat.

114
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,250 
I've seen that look before

115
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,250 
in the army.

116
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,583 
Men who will do anything

117
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,583 
to save themselves.

118
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,833 
And how do we

119
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,833 
save ourselves?

120
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,333 
ISIL takes this prison, we'll be

121
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,333 
the first they slaughter.

122
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,000 
When they take this prison,

123
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,000 
it will be

124
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,458 
to liberate their leader, Ramal.

125
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,166 
But if, when they get here,

126
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,125 
we have him with a knife

127
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,625 
to his throat,

128
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,291 
then we call the shots.

129
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,083 
And we might just live.

130
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,041 
MICHAEL:

131
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,041 
Whip, I got a Hail Mary.

132
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,916 
That a prayer or a plan?

133
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,916 
Plan.

134
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,416 
I left something the last time

135
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,416 
I was in here.

136
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,125 
Let me guess,

137
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,125 
you got a contingency.

138
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,333 
They lock me away in a box

139
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,333 
for four years.

140
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,708 
I'm not just gonna sit there.

141
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,375 
It's a long shot,

142
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,375 
but it might get us out.

143
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,041 
ABU RAMAL:

144
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,041 
The infidel still

145
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,041 
tries to escape.

146
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,166 
The desperate rat.

147
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,750 
The desperate rat's

148
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,750 
gonna light you up

149
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,083 
once we get out of here,

150
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,958 
you bugged-eyed freak.

151
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,958 
MICHAEL:

152
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,958 
Whip.

153
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,375 
Whip! An "S."

154
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,375 
Is there an "S"

155
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,625 
carved in your wall

156
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,625 
chest high

157
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,125 
in the corner?

158
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,083 
Come on, come on.

159
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,375 
That's not it.

160
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,416 
I'm not seeing anything.

161
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,000 
I'm not seeing it.

162
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,583 
Ja, it's got to be you.

163
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,416 
Come on. Tell me you got an "S"

164
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,416 
carved in your wall.

165
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,666 
It's our last chance.

166
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,000 
No.

167
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,916 
It's not here, no.

168
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,541 
(laughing)

169
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,375 
(whispering): That's because

170
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,375 
I have it in my cell.

171
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,916 
(explosion)

172
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,708 
My armies of the caliphate

173
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,833 
are coming closer.

174
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,083 
The moment they reach

175
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,083 
this place,

176
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,958 
all of you will be put down

177
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,958 
like the dogs that you are.

178
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,083 
♪ ♪

00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,833 
I went to grammar school

judge can help us?

204
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,541 
I called him a few hours ago

205
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,541

the Wahabbists frown upon,

And they're gonna try

258
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,625 
and get us out.

259
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,916

00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,916 
to meet us at the shop

261
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,291 
last night and we didn't show.

We can't just quit

00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,833 
and let Poseidon beat us.

264
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,833 
Ramal?

265
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,125 
There's a way out

266
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,125 
if we work together,

267
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,208

The only thing left for you

to do is to beg.

272
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,833 
Beg that I might let you live

273
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,833 
once my armies came,

274
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,416 
if only as a slave.

275
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,458 
I've been a slave

00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,541 
I will miss you

when you're dead,

281
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,500 
but only for a minute.

282
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,750 
Then you will be forgotten

283
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,083 
by both time

284
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,083

Well, no, I have the weekends

00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,791 
and I don't want

290
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,791 
a Wednesday afternoon.

I don't want to

303
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,541 
discuss this now.

304
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,125 
No, we'll talk about it later.

Bye.

306
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,750 
Of all the things

that mystify me in this world

00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,375 
since I've been released,

309
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,958 
is that kale is the rage.

310
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,208 
Kale.

Theodore Bagwell.

313
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,666 
Thing that mystifies me equally

314
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,166 
is seven years ago,

315
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,208 
you exonerated Michael,

316
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,333 
Lincoln, all of them,

317
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,000 
except me.

318
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,666 
(laughs, then grunts)

319
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,208 
Really?

320
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,208 
Yes!

321
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,333 
That's why you're here?

322
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,125 
Because I didn't exonerate you?

323
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,500 
A murderer,

324
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,875 
a sexual predator

325
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,875 
a dozen times over.

326
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,375 
"Was" is the key word.

327
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,416 
I'm a man moving

328
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,416 
toward the light now,

329
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,916 
and the light's beckoning me.

330
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,875 
I just don't know

331
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,875 
who's pulling the strings.

332
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,375 
But Sara says

333
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,375 
it's you.

334
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,833 
Oh, Sara put you onto me?

335
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,375 
Okay.

336
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,125 
I don't know who

337
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,125 
the bigger idiot is,

338
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,416 
you or her.

339
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,708 
I was helping her.

340
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,125 
You were hacking the phone

341
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,125 
and sending those people

342
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,666 
after her--

343
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,666 
Don't...

344
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,916 
lie.

345

Now...

347
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,208 
how about you pour me one of

348
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,208 
them nasty little kale jobbies,

349
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,333 
and tell me what's all this got

350
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,333 
to do with Scofield and myself,

351
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,625 
who your friends are,

352
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,250 
who you are--

353
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,250 
I want to see

354
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,333 
the true face

355
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,333 
of who's pulling my strings

356
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,833 
once and for all.

357
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,625 
(knocking)

358
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,166 
You have two visitors

359
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,166 
in the lobby.

360
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,208 
Tell them I'll be

361
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,208 
right down.

362
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,666 
(clears throat)

363
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,625 
Hey.

364
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,250 
I got this, Grace.

365
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,416 
(gunfire and shouting

366
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,416 
in distance)

367
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,625 
They're in the city.

368
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,916 
What are you doing?

369
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,333 
What do you think I'm doing?

370
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,416 
Don't run, you dog!

371
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,791 
Don't run!

372
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,833 
It is happening.

373
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,833 
Be ready.

374
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,208 
(indistinct shouting)

375
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,625 
(woman screaming)

376
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,333 
This pardon better

377
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,333 
get him out of here.

378
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,333 
We don't have

379
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,750 
much time-- we have

380
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,750 
to get to the warden.

381
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,166 
JAMIL:

382
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,166 
What's going on?

383
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,708 
(excited chatter, shouting)

384
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,208 
(speaking Arabic)

385
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,625 
They're abandoning the prison.

386
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,625 
That's why Ibrahim

387
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,958 
gave us that pardon.

388
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:45,958 
He knew it was worthless.

389
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,666 
You and C-Note get

390
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,666 
the others to the airport

391
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,666 
as fast as you can--

392
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,666 
there's maybe one flight out.

393
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,750 
Save two seats.

394
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,500 
All right?

395
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,791 
What are you

396
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,791 
going to do?

397
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,375 
I'm gonna get my brother.

398
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,625 
(men shouting, clamoring)

399
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,708 
MAN:

400
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,708 
Mustapha!

401
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,791 
Back up!

402
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,333 
Back up.

403
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,333 
Anyone comes at me, dies.

404
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,541 
Understand?

405
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,541 
You think you

406
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,541 
can shoot all of us?

407
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,458 
Anyone else want

408
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,458 
to play the lottery?

409
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,458 
Huh? You're filth.

410
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,500 
I'll let ISIL sort you out.

411
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,750 
ZAKAT:

412
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,750 
Mustapha!

413
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,583 
Mustapha! Mustapha, wait!

414
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,166 
Don't lock me in here!

415
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,541 
You coward.

416
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,541 
Mustapha, please.

417
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,458 
Coward!

418
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,958 
I need to get in!

419
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,958 
I need to get out!

420
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,750 
Well, give me the key.

421
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,750 
I don't have the key.

422
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,875 
You passed the guy who does.

423
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,958 
(men clamoring,

424
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,958 
gunfire in distance)

425
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,458 
(missile whistling through air)

426
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,666 
(indistinct shouts)

427
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,750 
Stay back!

428
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,750 
I don't want to shoot you!

429
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,750 
(indistinct shout)

430
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,583 
(pounding on door)

431
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:44,958 
The guards are gone!

432
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,416 
They're abandoning

433
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,416 
their posts!

434
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,541 
We're gonna be free!

435
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,291 
No. We're not free.

436
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,791 
Things just got a lot worse.

437
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,083 
MAN:

438
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,083 
Push the gate open!

439
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,541 
Stop!

440
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,250 
What are you doing?

441
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,083 
We have to get through the gate!

442
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,083 
If ISIL controls the city,

443
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,625 
like they say, it will be

444
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,625 
a prison out there as well.

445
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,750 
We will be persecuted,

446
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,000 
as we have been in here,

447
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,000 
only worse!

448
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,208 
At least there's

449
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,208 
a chance!

450
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,625 
You want a chance?

451
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,125 
Our chance lies in there,

452
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,000 
in solitary.

453
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,375 
Our bargaining chip.

454
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,833 
We get Abu Ramal!

455
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,875 
We negotiate passage

456
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,083 
out of the country.

457
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,666 
No, it's madness.

458
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,291 
Come on. If we work together,

459
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,291 
we can push open the gate.

460
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,000 
Is that you,

461
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,000 
Princess?

462
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,208 
It is you.

463
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,208 
We remember this one!

464
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,958 
Right? We remember him!

465
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,958 
Please... 

466
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,750 
Friend to Kaniel Outis,

467
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,041 
the man who would not

468
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,041 
lend my brother a hand!

469
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,958 
The man who

470
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,958 
killed my brother,

471
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,541 
as far as I'm

472
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,541 
concerned, right?

473
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,541 
We are going to go in there

474
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,541 
and get Abu Ramal!

475
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,541 
No! Please!

476
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,166 
No! Please!

477
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,166 
And when we are there,

478
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:46,500 
I am personally going to slice

479
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:46,500 
Kaniel Outis' throat.

480
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500 
And you are going to be the one

481
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500 
who's going to help me do it.

482
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,125 
No! You sent him!

483
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,333 
(men yelling)

484
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,333 
Take him!

485
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,833 
All of you!

486
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,041 
Will you stay here?

487
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,708 
And let ISIL slaughter you?

488
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,875 
Or will you stand with me?

489
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,125 
And fight!

490
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,500 
(men yelling)

491
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,416 
Doesn't sound very promising!

492
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,708 
Ramal,

493
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,833 
you want to rethink

494
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,833 
helping us?

495
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,625 
Escape has to start

496
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,625 
from your cell!

497
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,333 
All you infidels can go to hell!

498
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,458 
We are in hell, Ramal.

499
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,125 
Question is do you want out?

500
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,250 
Smash through the door!

501
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,250 
(shouting)

502
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,125 
Tell me what to do.

503
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,333 
MAN:

504
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,333 
Come on, come on...

505
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,666 
(woman screams)

506
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,541 
(men shouting in Arabic)

507
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,333 
(man shouting in Arabic)

508
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,125 
Hey, police officer...

509
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,666 
I'm not a police officer.

510
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,333 
Then what are the

511
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,333 
stripes on your pants?

512
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,166 
Papers!

513
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,041 
Papers!!

514
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,833 
Now, or we shoot, understand?!

515
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,375 
He's got a gun!

516
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,916 
KELLERMAN:

517
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,916 
<i>I'm not hacking</i>

518
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,916 
<i>anybody's phones.</i>

519
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,833 
You're so off

520
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,833 
base on this,

521
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,083 
you have no idea.

522
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,125 
Am I?

523
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,125 
(chuckles)

524
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,375 
Y-Yes.

525
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500 
(spits)

526
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500 
That is terrible,

527
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500 
by the way.

528
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500 
What is that,

529
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,125 
an act of contrition?

530
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,416 
Like a hair shirt?

531
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,041 
Torture yourself with kale

532
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,041 
to make up for your sins?

533
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,000 
I don't have any sins

534
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,000 
anymore, man.

535
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,166 
That's you.

536
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,166 
How about

537
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,166 
the sin of deceit?

538
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,750 
Hmm?

539
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,000 
A kale-drinking man named

540
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,000 
Kellerman by the light of day,

541
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,583 
a murderous CIA rogue

542
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,583 
named Poseidon at night.

543
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,000 
Poseidon?

544
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,625 
(whoops)

545
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,625 
His eyes light up.

546
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,708 
She was right.

547
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,833 
Oh, you think I'm Poseidon?

548
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,500 
(laughing):

549
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,500 
Okay.

550
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,916 
Are you mixed up with Poseidon?

551
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,166 
Oh, hell,

552
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,291 
we got to go old school

553
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,291 
with this?

554
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,458 
Is that what you want?

555
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,333 
T-Bag

556
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,333 
snapping fingers.

557
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,333 
Ow!

558
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,625 
That's very-- you just gave

559
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,625 
me something to work with.

560
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,833 
Poseidon? Poseidon.

561
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,791 
(scoffs)

562
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,750 
I'll tell you

563
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,750 
about Poseidon.

564
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,958 
I mean, he's one of those myths

565
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,958 
you hear about in the system.

566
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,458 
He's an operative

567
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,458 
so untouchable,

568
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,916 
so deep, you couldn't find him

569
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,916 
with a nuclear sub.

570
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,875 
Hence the nickname.

571
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,833 
And how does this involve me?

572
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,958 
What's he want with Michael?

573
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,916 
(banging)

574
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,208 
MICHAEL:

575
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,208 
Ramal, listen closely.

576
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,666 
The brick with the

577
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,666 
S-- it's loose.

578
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,958 
You got to remove it.

579
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,250 
(shouting, clamoring outside)

580
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,458 
It's a spoon, string.

581
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,208 
How?

582
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,208 
A string a day

583
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,208 
from my uniforms for four years.

584
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,833 
A spoon a guard overlooked

585
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,833 
one time in a thousand.

586
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,125 
There's a water pipe above you.

587
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,458 
Hook it,

588
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,458 
pull it down.

589
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,083 
Do it!

590
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,583 
Hey. Let me get this straight.

591
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,583 
This is getting him out?

592
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,208 
MICHAEL: It's

593
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,208 
getting us all out.

594
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,708 
This is a two-cell job,

595
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,708 
mine and his.

596
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,916 
That's why I couldn't

597
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,916 
pull it off

598
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,250 
when I was in that cell,

599
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,833 
because the guy

600
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,833 
across from me,

601
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,250 
the guy in this cell,

602
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,250 
wouldn't cooperate.

603
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,500 
(echoing):

604
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,500 
We have to work together.

605
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,791 
Come on!

606
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,500 
No.

607
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,500 
Cross!

608
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,208 
I'm not working with you.

609
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,000 
No. No.

610
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,666 
(yells) Come here!

611
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,666 
Come on, sweetheart.

612
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,583 
Show them your pretty face!

613
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,583 
Come on, get up here!

614
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,166 
Look! Stop

615
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,166 
what you're doing

616
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,791 
and tell Kaniel Outis

617
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,791 
I will kill the girl!

618
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,125 
(yells)

619
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,916 
Take him!

620
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,375 
Come on! I'm not

621
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,375 
through with you yet!

622
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,291 
They're beating the crap

623
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,291 
out of Sid. They'll kill him

624
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,875 
unless we surrender.

625
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,875 
If we surrender,

626
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,291 
they'll kill us.

627
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,291 
They only want Ramal.

628
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:56,000 
Our best chance of saving

629
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:56,000 
Sid is getting out of here.

630
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,125 
Make them forget about him,

631
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,125 
start chasing us.

632
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,750 
Okay, good.

633
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,916 
Now pick it up.

634
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,916 
String the cord

635
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:04,958 
and pull it through.

636
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:05,958 
(man yelling,

637
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:05,958 
banging on wall)

638
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,333 
Come on,

639
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,333 
come on!

640
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,333 
Yeah!

641
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,500 
I will kill the girl,

642
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,500 
I swear it!

643
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500 
No!

644
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,041 
I will say it again,

645
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,708 
there will not be any killing

646
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,708 
in this prison.

647
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,708 
Not on my watch.

648
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,333 
WHIP: This is

649
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,333 
completely insane.

650
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,333 
It's a frigging Mexican

651
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,333 
soap opera out here!

652
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,458 
Ramal, don't stop.

653
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,458 
Don't start thinking.

654
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,583 
Don't pin your

655
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,583 
hopes on one guard.

656
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,750 
Walk away!

657
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,916 
Hide in the cell block!

658
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,750 
What are you doing?

659
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,000 
The prison is done, brother.

660
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,416 
For the love of God.

661
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,208 
For the love of God,

662
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,208 
a man seeks justice.

663
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,958 
In everything he does,

664
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,958 
at all times.

665
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,791 
Now, everybody,

666
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,791 
back in the block.

667
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,375 
There are no prisoners

668
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,375 
and guards anymore.

669
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,625 
You realize that, right?

670
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,750 
If ISIL gets in here,

671
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,458 
we are all the enemy.

672
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,958 
Sinners,

673
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,083 
deviants...

674
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,416 
and those

675
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,416 
that locked up their leader.

676
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,375 
You will be the only

677
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,375 
guard that they catch.

678
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,208 
The noble one.

679
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,791 
They will behead you for it.

680
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,791 
But...

681
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,833 
if we work together,

682
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,416 
we get Ramal,

683
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,083 
we have a bargaining chip.

684
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,583 
I will see to it

685
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,416 
that you will get out

686
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,416 
with the rest of us.

687
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,583 
Just give me the keys

688
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,583 
to solitary.

689
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,583 
I don't have the keys.

690
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,458 
I know you do.

691
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,958 
Join us

692
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,875 
and you will live.

693
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,958 
I give you my word.

694
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,458 
I don't have them.

695
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,041 
(grunting)

696
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,041 
(prisoners cheering)

697
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,583 
Kill him!

698
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,541 
(cheering)

699
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,791 
But you have something

700
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,791 
much better, huh?

701
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,416 
Move. Move!

702
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,041 
WHIP:

703
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,041 
Oh, my God.

704
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,916 
Oh, my God.

705
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,916 
They killed the guard!

706
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,000 
They got his gun!

707
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,000 
They're coming for us!

708
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,875 
Got to make this count, Ramal.

709
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,625 
String that fishing pole

710
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,625 
through that slot.

711
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,333 
That's right.

712
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,625 
Now, you can

713
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,625 
remove the pinions

714
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,041 
on my door-- the hinges.

715
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,375 
There are

716
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,375 
two of them.

717
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,958 
No way.

718
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,791 
What are you doing?

719
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,416 
What are you doing?

720
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,750 
I'm doing mine.

721
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,458 
We don't have time

722
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,458 
for this, Ramal!

723
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,083 
I'm telling you,

724
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,083 
it's a two-cell job,

725
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,708 
that's the point.

726
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,708 
That side of the wing

727
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,458 
is new construction.

728
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,458 
The pinions

729
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,291 
are covered in the hinges--

730
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,291 
you can't pull them.

731
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,750 
This side is original.

732
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,750 
They're open, loose.

733
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,666 
You want me to free you?

734
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,666 
Yes, and I, in turn, free you

735
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,666 
with those keys, down there.

736
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,666 
Why would I trust you more than

737
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,666 
the madman out there?

738
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,916 
'Cause you just heard

739
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,916 
what his word is worth.

740
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,875 
Kick it.

741
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,666 
(thumping)

742
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,666 
This is it. It's all about

743
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,666 
whose word you trust.

744
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,083 
I promise you-- you release me,

745
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,083 
I release you.

746
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,458 
Little more,

747
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,458 
little more.

748
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:46,541 
Thank God. Come on.

749
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,041 
Okay, the bottom.

750
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,250 
Yes!

751
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,458 
(thumping continues)

752
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,625 
Come on,

753
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,500 
come on. Come on.

754
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,500 
Come on.

755
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,708 
Yes!

756
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:58,833 
Almost there!

757
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,125 
(grunting)

758
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,875 
WHIP:

759
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,875 
Yes.

760
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,375 
Come on.

761
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,375 
(thumping)

762
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,041 
Got to hurry up, come on.

763
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,916 
Yes. Yes, come on!

764
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,875 
RAMAL:

765
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,875 
Where are you going?

766
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,958 
Open my door.

767
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,666 
I'm getting the hell

768
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,666 
out of here.

769
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,083 
RAMAL:

770
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,083 
Open my door.

771
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,333 
Leave him, man, you crazy?

772
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,333 
Open my door.

773
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,625 
Once we're outside

774
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,625 
these walls, we need

775
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,125 
safe passage out of the country.

776
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,625 
Even now, you negotiate.

777
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,916 
(door straining)

778
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:52,125 
We work together or we both die.

779
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,916 
You have my word.

780
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,541 
Open the door.

781
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:58,958 
(mouths)

782
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,333 
We got to go now.

783
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,708 
(clamoring, banging)

784
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,708 
(cheering)

785
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,583 
(indistinct chatter)

786
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,083 
No, no!

787
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,625 
(indistinct conversations)

788
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,000 
KID:

789
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,000 
Mr. Tic Tac.

790
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,250 
What are you doing here?

791
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,500 
You gonna fight ISIL men?

792
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,166 
Get out of here,

793
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,166 
kid, hide!

794
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,333 
This is no place for you.

795
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,333 
You gonna fight ISIL men?

796
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,083 
Yes.

797
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,166 
Listen very closely,

798
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,166 
all right?

799
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,791 
American!

800
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,791 
American!

801
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,375 
American!

802
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,625 
There's an American over there.

803
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:44,416 
What?

804
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,333 
Around the corner.

805
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,333 
He want to fight you.

806
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:48,916 
Let's go

807
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,791 
We'll check this block.

808
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,458 
You go to Bubble Gum Man now?

809
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,458 
Yeah.

810
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,083 
Thanks for your help.

811
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,083 
Here, take that.

812
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,333 
Get somewhere safe, okay?

813
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,625 
Mr. Tic Tac goes

814
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,625 
to Bubble Gum Man!

815
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,625 
(indistinct chatter)

816
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,791 
Ramal... don't want to kill you.

817
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:34,083 
Just your friends.

818
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:34,083 
You understand?

819
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,250 
What are we doing in here?

820
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,250 
This is not helping us.

821
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,500 
You're gonna make

822
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,500 
a phone call

823
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,750 
so you can hold up

824
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,750 
your end of the deal.

825
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,583 
There's an auto body shop

826
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,583 
off Nashwan Plaza.

827
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,041 
I want vehicles there,

828
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,041 
full tanks of gas

829
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,958 
so we can get to the border,

830
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,958 
all of us.

831
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,041 
I'm not going with you

832
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,041 
to the border.

833
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:47,500 
MICHAEL:

834
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:47,500 
You don't have a choice.

835
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,125 
We're gonna ride to the border,

836
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,125 
then say sayonara.

837
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,541 
You're our insurance.

838
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:51,625 
CROSS:

839
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:51,625 
Ramal, I don't want to kill you.

840
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,166 
You understand?

841
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,791 
Or would you rather be

842
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,791 
their insurance? Take it.

843
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,333 
(speaking Arabic)

844
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,208 
I want to know what he's saying.

845
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,208 
He could be screwing us.

846
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:11,875 
He's screwing with us,

847
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:11,875 
all right.

848
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,208 
We just need to screw

849
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,208 
with him first.

850
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,541 
Where's Ja?

851
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,291 
I don't know.

852
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:20,041 
(Ja coughing)

853
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:21,458 
Oxycodone...

854
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:21,458 
Hey, we got to peel.

855
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:22,958 
Percocet...

856
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,875 
Come on, you Japanese

857
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,875 
junkie son of a bitch.

858
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,750 
I'm Korean,

859
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,750 
you Canadian monkey.

860
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,541 
Canadian? Oh, that's

861
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,541 
really funny, Ja.

862
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,791 
You'd split my sides if we

863
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,791 
weren't about to be slaughtered.

864
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,291 
Hey, remember what

865
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,291 
Woody Allen said.

866
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:36,250 
What did he say?

867
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,958 
"I don't mind dying.

868
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:41,250 
I just don't want to be around

869
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:41,250 
when it happens."

870
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,541 
Hey, come on.

871
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,625 
We need you, okay?

872
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:45,916 
MICHAEL:

873
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:45,916 
What's the holdup?

874
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:48,000 
(door opens)

875
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:00,625 
Check there!

876
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,250 
KELLERMAN:

877
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,250 
<i>Scofield's a dead man.</i>

878
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,375 
He's tangling with Poseidon.

879
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,583 
I see what you're

880
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,583 
doing here.

881
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:17,500 
Talking Poseidon,

882
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:17,500 
"third person,"

883
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,875 
like you're not him.

884
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,208 
State Department has been

885
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,958 
looking for Poseidon for years,

886
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:24,666 
you idiot. He's a

887
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:24,666 
rogue CIA operative.

888
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:25,750 
Nobody knows who he is.

889
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,625 
Here we go.

890
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,625 
I know it's a little

891
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,416 
above your pay grade,

892
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,416 
being a common criminal.

893
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,958 
I mean, we're talking

894
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,958 
about a single man.

895
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:32,458 
Right? A hawk

896
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,791 
who apparently doesn't

897
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,791 
like how the White House

898
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,416 
goes about foreign policy,

899
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,500 
and decided to take matters

900
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,500 
into his own hands.

901
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,791 
Not with armies,

902
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,791 
not with invasions,

903
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:42,333 
but by getting a

904
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:42,333 
single person killed,

905
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:44,333 
by getting a single person

906
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:44,333 
elected to office,

907
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,875 
by getting a single person

908
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,875 
released from prison.

909
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,416 
Prison, like the one in Yemen,

910
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,416 
where Michael's at.

911
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:51,916 
You want my guess?

912
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:55,625 
It's Abu Ramal that

913
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:55,625 
Poseidon wants free.

914
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,500 
Guy I seen on the prison telly.

915
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,708 
Wait, I thought the CIA was

916
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,708 
supposed to kill terrorists,

917
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,666 
not release them.

918
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,666 
Poseidon is no longer CIA.

919
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:04,208 
He doesn't report

920
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:04,208 
to anybody.

921
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:06,458 
He just pursues

922
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:06,458 
his own ideology.

923
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,708 
Okay, for instance, listen.

924
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:11,083 
Let's say you think

925
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:11,083 
Russia and Iran

926
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,666 
are having too much influence

927
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,666 
in the Middle East,

928
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,875 
and you don't

929
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,875 
think Washington

930
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,666 
is getting the job done.

931
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,041 
You free Ramal.

932
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,583 
Sure, he's an Islamic

933
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,583 
radical nut job,

934
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,750 
but he will fight Iran

935
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,750 
and Russia for you.

936
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,500 
The enemy of my enemy

937
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,500 
is my friend.

938
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,583 
And what's so shrewd

939
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,583 
about Poseidon

940
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,250 
is he does it all

941
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,250 
without a network,

942
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,875 
which is why he's

943
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,875 
so hard to find.

944
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,541 
One man can pull strings

945
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,541 
like that?

946
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,875 
One man manipulating

947
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,875 
a handful of others.

948
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:38,708 
Abu Ramal is a monster.

949
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,708 
And there's a spot in hell

950
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,708 
reserved for him,

951
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:45,208 
but the hottest spot

952
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:45,208 
is reserved for Poseidon,

953
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,750 
because he is letting Ramal

954
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,750 
loose on the world again.

955
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,666 
Those men, they have

956
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,666 
the blood of thousands,

957
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:53,291 
thousands on their hands.

958
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:56,041 
Compared to them, you and me

959
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:56,041 
are a couple of angels.

960
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:58,541 
(quiet laugh)

961
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,708 
"Angels"?

962
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,708 
Mm-hmm.

963
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,250 
You find out who Poseidon is,

964
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,208 
and how Scofield

965
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,208 
is wrapped up in it,

966
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,666 
maybe your fate...

967
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:08,583 
is to be a patriot.

968
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,791 
(muffled gunshot, glass breaks)

969
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,791 
What...

970
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,833 
(gunshot)

971
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,833 
(shouts, grunting)

972
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,666 
(grunting)

973
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,583 
(chuckles)

974
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,500 
There's a time for everything.

975
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,583 
911? I need help.

976
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,291 
Now.

977
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:00,458 
(men shouting)

978
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,750 
WHIP:

979
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,750 
They're going over the top.

980
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,583 
Let's go.

981
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,708 
Go, go, go, go, go!

982
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:22,500 
This way!

983
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,541 
It's locked!

984
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:32,041 
It's a dead end.

985
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,166 
No, no, no, no. No.

986
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,166 
No, no, no, no.

987
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,541 
Ramal?

988
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:41,000 
Hide!

989
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,458 
CROSS: I don't want to kill you.

990
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,458 
Just your friends.

991
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:47,375 
You understand?

992
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:47,375 
Sid, you're alive?

993
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:50,125 
SID: We'll see about that.

994
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:50,125 
Ramal?!

995
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:51,625 
Let's hand

996
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:51,625 
the son of a bitch over.

997
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,208 
Won't work.

998
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:54,666 
They'll gun us down anyway.

999
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:57,041 
Can't just wait here and die.

1000
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,541 
The game is up.

1001
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,125 
Come out.

1002
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:06,625 
(feet shuffling on floor)

1003
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:07,625 
(gunshots)

1004
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:11,500 
(groans)

1005
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,000 
Anyone who gets between me

1006
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,791 
and Abu Ramal dies.

1007
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:23,458 
You understand?!

1008
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,916 
Where is Ramal?

1009
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:30,291 
Tell me now!

1010
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:32,291 
(speaks Arabic)

1011
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,791 
There's a boy.

1012
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:40,000 
Ithaca, New York.

1013
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:40,000 
Mike Scofield.

1014
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,916 
If I don't make it

1015
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,916 
out of here alive,

1016
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:45,041 
tell him his father

1017
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:45,041 
loves him very much.

1018
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,791 
His father?

1019
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,791 
If I don't smother that gun,

1020
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,166 
he'll kill us all.

1021
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:06,833 
(yells)

1022
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,250 
(screaming)

1023
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:31,625 
(men shouting)

1024
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,083 
Move back!

1025
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:49,750 
Move back! Go!

1026
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,875 
Let me through!

1027
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:04,500 
Michael! Michael!

1028
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,833 
Michael? Michael!

1029
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,416 
Poseidon sent you?

1030
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:34,916 
Where's your friend?

1031
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:36,125 
He's long gone.

1032
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,750 
Back door.

1033
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:40,375 
Locked from the inside.

1034
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,625 
VAN GOGH:

1035
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,625 
He's in here.

1036
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,625 
Find him.

1037
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:47,041 
I was you once,

1038
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:47,041 
killing for a lie.

1039
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,208 
Now you're what?

1040
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,000 
Dying for the truth?

1041
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,958 
It's human nature

1042
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,958 
to find stuff out,

1043
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:56,708 
so you will.

1044
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:59,375 
Or she will.

1045
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:02,500 
And then the lie

1046
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:02,500 
has to kill the truth.

1047
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,125 
Which one of you

1048
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,125 
is gonna die ne...

1049
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,541 
(distant siren wailing)

1050
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,083 
Time to get scarce.

1051
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,458 
Hey!

1052
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:37,208 
(sirens wailing)

1053
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,875 
What did he say to you?

1054
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:43,500 
Nothing.

1055
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:58,416 
(engine starts)

1056
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,166 
(panting)

1057
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,291 
Auto shop's a

1058
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,291 
few blocks up.

1059
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,500 
And your men

1060
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,500 
better be coming.

1061
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,625 
They will be there.

1062
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:19,916 
Where is Ja?

1063
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:25,791 
Ja,

1064
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,666 
what are you doing?

1065
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,666 
I'm starving, man.

1066
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,416 
You know how long it's

1067
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,416 
been since I seen fruit?

1068
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,875 
MICHAEL:

1069
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,875 
You're stopping to eat?

1070
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,333 
Are you high?!

1071
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,166 
Don't come at me, man.

1072
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,166 
You're not my mama.

1073
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,958 
You know what? You're done.

1074
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,458 
You're gone.

1075
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,458 
What?

1076
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:42,250 
Wait.

1077
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:42,250 
I said, walk!

1078
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:42,250 
You're a liability!

1079
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,166 
Wait, wait. You said

1080
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,166 
you'd get me out,

1081
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,333 
all the way home.

1082
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,333 
That was the deal.

1083
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:50,000 
(grunts)

1084
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,041 
MICHAEL:

1085
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,041 
Ramal, this man follows us,

1086
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,333 
tell your men

1087
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,333 
to shoot him.

1088
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,625 
Gladly.

1089
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,416 
LINCOLN:

1090
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,416 
Where'd you go, Michael?

1091
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,125 
Where'd you go?

1092
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:57,083 
(door opens)

1093
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,708 
Hands up!

1094
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,958 
There you are, my men.

1095
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,750 
Seize these dogs so that

1096
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,750 
we can put them down.

1097
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,125 
Hands up, Infidels!

1098
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,791 
Ramal.

1099
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:17,875 
Ramal, what are you doing?

1100
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,333 
You thought you tricked me?

1101
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:22,333 
Take the long way around

1102
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,791 
while your friend...

1103
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:29,708 
...gets here first

1104
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:29,708 
to get weapons.

1105
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,916 
You were going to screw me.

1106
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,916 
That's the American slang.

1107
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,083 
Isn't it?

1108
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,083 
You were gonna screw me.

1109
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,333 
So much for our word.

1110
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:40,125 
Lying to enemies.

1111
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,041 
It's called <i>Taqiyya.</i>

1112
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,083 
Take off the camera.

1113
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,500 
I will show the world

1114
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,750 
what happens

1115
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,625 
when you screw Abu Ramal.

1116
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,625 
On your knees!

1117
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:58,041 
It's not gonna happen.

1118
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:58,041 
Make them on their knees!

1119
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:00,833 
(men speaking Arabic)

1120
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,458 
(grunting)

1121
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:18,875 
Enough!

1122
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,666 
(men speaking Arabic)

1123
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,958 
Drop your weapons.

1124
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,791 
Step away from my brother.

1125
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,583 
Linc.

1126
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,250 
How much do you love

1127
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,250 
this brother of yours?

1128
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:46,791 
Why don't you step down

1129
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:46,791 
from that truck?

1130
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,708 
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

1131
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,708 
No, it's not going down

1132
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,708 
like this, okay? Just...

1133
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,250 
stop. I got way too many

1134
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,250 
questions for my friend here.

1135
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,500 
Step back!

1136
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,500 
I went to prison

1137
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,500 
for killing

1138
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,166 
a guy in a bar fight.

1139
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,166 
I didn't even want

1140
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:02,291 
to get into it, okay? He starts

1141
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:02,291 
talking yang to my girl.

1142
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,666 
I tell him to beat it.

1143
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:06,541 
He pulls a knife,

1144
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:06,541 
and I see red.

1145
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:08,833 
One second later,

1146
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:12,125 
I'm holding his bloody knife,

1147
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:12,125 
and it's his body on the ground.

1148
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:14,708 
You're not that fast.

1149
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:14,708 
One second.

1150
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,166 
Please don't do this.

1151
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,166 
You will lose.

1152
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:20,583 
Listen to your friend.

1153
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,000 
I'm talking to you, Ramal.

1154
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,291 
I told you!

1155
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,291 
Step down from that truck.

1156
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:27,833 
Pick up your weapons!

1157
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,041 
You've got one second till

1158
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,041 
that one second happens.

1159
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,708 
Go to hell. (groans)

1160
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:34,916 
(shouting in Arabic)

1161
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:41,625 
(loud groaning)

1162
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,708 
(engine rumbling nearby)

1163
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,791 
(tires squealing)

1164
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,833 
We got more coming!

1165
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,083 
WHIP: And more over here!

1166
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,083 
This is a big problem.

1167
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,166 
WHIP: Let's get the

1168
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,166 
hell out of here.

1169
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:57,916 
(gunfire)

1170
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,916 
(groans)

1171
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,416 
(groans softly)

1172
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,458 
AW: You wanted

1173
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,458 
to see us?

1174
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,458 
Ouch.

1175
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:29,041 
Come on. Come on.

1176
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:51,375 
(camera shutter clicking)

1177
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:55,416 
Behold the villain.

1178
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:59,083 
(indistinct shouting)

1179
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:10,708 
Who the hell is this guy?

1180
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:12,875 
He's my brother.

1181
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:18,916 
He's my brother.

1182
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,625 
I can't believe this.

1183
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:23,875 
I just can't believe this.

1184
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:23,875 
I can't believe this.

1185
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:27,416 
Back at the prison. Why?

1186
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:29,291 
Why did you say...

1187
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:29,291 
I had to deny you.

1188
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,416 
You were... you were filming me.

1189
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:34,791 
They can't know.

1190
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:34,791 
Who can't know?

1191
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,083 
They can't know

1192
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,083 
I'm getting out.

1193
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,083 
Who?

1194
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:39,041 
I'll explain

1195
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:39,041 
everything later, just...

1196
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,458 
Sara and-and Mike?

1197
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,166 
They're good.

1198
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:44,958 
They're fine.

1199
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:44,958 
Oh, thank God.

1200
00:41:44,958 --> 00:41:47,000 
Thank God.

1201
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,500 
Questions just keep

1202
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,500 
piling up, huh?

1203
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500 
That's you.

It's all of us.

1207
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,625 
What are they saying?

1208
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:57,500 
That ISIL has taken over

1209
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:57,500 
the government station.

1210
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,083 
That their beloved

1211
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,083 
leader, Abu Ramal,

1212
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:03,458 
has been martyred.

1213
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:06,416 
That we're the

1214
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:06,416 
ones that did it.

1215
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:07,708 
The entire army

1216
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:07,708 
of ISIL

1217
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:10,333 
just declared war on us.
