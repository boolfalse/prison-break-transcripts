1
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,500 
(phone rings)

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,125 
Hi.

3
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:19,541 
Hey. I, uh, I ran into town

4
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:19,541 
to get some coffee.

5
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,625 
<i>Do you want anything? </i>

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,625 
No. I'm good.

7
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,166 
<i>Thanks, honey.</i>

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,166 
<i>I'm almost done here.</i>

9
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,333 
<i>I will see you at the lake</i>

10
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,333 
<i>in a little while, okay?</i>

11
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,708 
Okay. I'll see you

12
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,708 
back at the house.

13
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,291 
The hubby?

14
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,083 
Uh, what did you learn

15
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,083 
from Kellerman?

16
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,666 
There's no easy way

17
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,666 
to deliver this news, darling.

18
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,666 
It's a heartbreaker.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,958 
Doesn't get any better.

20
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,166 
He's rotten all the way

21
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,166 
to the core.

22
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,166 
You've been sleeping

23
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,166 
with the enemy, baby.

24
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,875 
I don't understand.

25
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,333 
I followed them two monkeys

26
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,333 
from Kellerman's house

27
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,833 
right after they put

28
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,833 
a bullet in him.

29
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,041 
Needless to say

30
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,041 
he wasn't our guy.

31
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,416 
(laughs)

32
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,750 
He did say some

33
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,750 
pretty alarming things

34
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,166 
about your boy, Poseidon,

35
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,166 
the world shaker.

36
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,291 
Um...

37
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,291 
Didn't give me enough

38
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,291 
to put all the pieces together.

39
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,500 
Back up, back up, back up.

40
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,500 
What did they say?

41
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,250 
Jacob? His words?

42
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,375 
I couldn't get close enough

43
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,375 
to hear much, but what I did...

44
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,541 
what I did hear was

45
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,541 
your name and Michael's.

46
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,833 
Yes, they seemed pretty cozy,

47
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,833 
the three of them.

48
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,833 
Oh, my God.

49
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,541 
It's a nasty bag of conspir...

50
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,541 
Where are you going?!

51
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,833 
To my son!

52
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:22,333 
WHIP:

53
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:22,333 
Stay down. Stay down.

54
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,541 
It's another

55
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,541 
artillery strike.

56
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:31,083 
LINCOLN: But they sure

57
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:31,083 
as hell are used to it.

58
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,166 
Go, go!

59
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,416 
(crowd chanting in Arabic)

60
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:07,333 
We will not rest,

61
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:07,333 
not sleep, until the murderers

62
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,833 
of the martyred Abu Ramal are

63
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,833 
dead, crushed beneath our feet.

64
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,208 
(crowd shouting)

65
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,208 
(crowd chanting in Arabic)

66
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,291 
No safe harbor in Yemen!

67
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,291 
They will be destroyed!

68
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,333 
It is Allah's promise to us.

69
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,083 
CROWD:

70
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,083 
<i>Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar.</i>

71
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,125 
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

72
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,666 
Any man or woman in Sana'a who

73
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,666 
turns the westerners over to us

74
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,708 
will receive ten million rial!

75
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,791 
(crowd shouts)

76
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,625 
Now go! Find them!

77
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:55,125 
Any man or woman in Sana'a who

78
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:55,125 
turns the westerners over to us

79
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,125 
will receive ten million rial!

80
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,000 
SID: ISIL just offered

81
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,000 
ten million for our heads!

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,666 
Wait. Wait. Stay here.

83
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,875 
We got to get off these streets

84
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:04,875 
or we're dead.

85
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,625 
Ten million rial?

86
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,000 
You give up your mother

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,166 
for cash like that.

88
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,541 
It's about what I paid

89
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,500 
for Freddie Mercury's ashes.

90
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,750 
Freddie Mercury now, really?

91
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,833 
It's better than talking

92
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,833 
about 500,000 people

93
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,500 
looking to kill us.

94
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,750 
Come on.

95
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,833 
Found a place

96
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,833 
to figure out next steps.

97
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,041 
Let's go.

98
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,458 
This is the part

99
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,458 
you tell me what's going on,

100
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,833 
the whole thing.

101
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,416 
No. Th-There's no time.

102
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,750 
Country's about to fall.

103
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,750 
You'll get your

104
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,750 
answers, I promise.

105
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,000 
Right now our window is closing.

106
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,250 
We need to...

107
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,416 
We need to pivot

108
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,416 
to the next contingency.

109
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,291 
Train station.

110
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,291 
Get up to the north.

111
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,375 
Exit the country that way.

112
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,833 
Things have changed

113
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,833 
in the four years

114
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,708 
you've been locked up

115
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,708 
in Ogygia, Michael.

116
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,375 
Your plan's redundant.

117
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,750 
ISIL control the north, roads,

118
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,750 
checkpoints, train stations.

119
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,916 
Even if we make it across

120
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,916 
the city, it's suicide.

121
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,750 
No. You're wrong.

122
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,750 
It's a shell game.

123
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,583 
You go where

124
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,583 
they never expect you.

125
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,958 
Wait. You came all the way

126
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,958 
to Yemen looking for him.

127
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,000 
You think he was

128
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,000 
lost or something?

129
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500 
Come on.

130
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,750 
You want to live?

131
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,250 
The airport's

132
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,250 
the only option.

133
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,125 
The airport's known as the main

134
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,125 
artery to the outside world.

135
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,833 
It's the first thing

136
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,833 
ISIL will shut down.

137
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,875 
Planes were flying an hour ago.

138
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,875 
You got a phone?

139
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,791 
No, but he does.

140
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,333 
Burned it up

141
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,333 
getting off to Queen, though.

142
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,666 
Guilty as charged.

143
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,291 
C-Note's organizing a passage

144
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,291 
on the flight as we speak.

145
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,083 
MICHAEL:

146
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,083 
No, I'm telling you,

147
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,500 
my plan will work.

148
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,625 
Once... once you leave

149
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,166 
the northern part

150
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,166 
of Sana'a...

151
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,791 
Enough. We shouldn't even

152
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,791 
be talking about this.

153
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,000 
MICHAEL:

154
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,000 
Get off me!

155
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,083 
How are you alive?!

156
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,833 
In Yemen?!

157
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,083 
What happened to you, Michael?!

158
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:52,416 
Now, I'm not moving

159
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:52,416 
another inch until you tell me

160
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,708 
what the hell's

161
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,708 
really going on here.

162
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,250 
♪ ♪

163
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,416 
Michael Scofield had to die.

164
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:38,041 
I had to fake my death.

165
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,375 
Go away.

166
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,583 
It was part of the deal I made.

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,375 
If I went to work

168
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,375 
for a deep-cover operative

169
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,458 
named Poseidon...

170
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,583 
...we would all go free.

171
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,625 
We <i>were </i>free.

172
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,500 
We were exonerated.

173
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,458 
No.

174
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,750 
That's what we thought...

175
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,791 
but we were wrong.

176
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,041 
A few weeks

177
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,041 
before I married Sara...

178
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,000 
I was approached by Poseidon.

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,458 
You think I'm showing?

180
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,416 
I'm not used to that yet.

181
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,583 
I got to...

182
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,583 
I got to tell Michael.

183
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,250 
Here you go. Burgers

184
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,250 
will be just a second.

185
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,250 
Hello?

186
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,041 
Yes, this is Michael.

187
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,583 
Poseidon told me

188
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,583 
Kellerman didn't have

189
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,375 
the authority or jurisdiction

190
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,375 
to exonerate our crimes.

191
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,666 
He used that as a legal fulcrum.

192
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,375 
Told me he could put us

193
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,375 
all away for life

194
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,125 
within the mandate

195
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,125 
of the law unless...

196
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,583 
...unless I went

197
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,583 
to work for him.

198
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,958 
What the hell

199
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,958 
can they be talking about

200
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,166 
at a time like this?

201
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,291 
I don't know.

202
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,875 
But big brother's hearing things

203
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,875 
I want to hear.

204
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,041 
SID:

205
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,041 
We cannot stay.

206
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,041 
We must go now.

207
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,375 
Maybe we don't.

208
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,291 
What the hell

209
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,291 
are you talking about?

210
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,458 
Maybe all this running

211
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,708 
is just delaying the inevitable.

212
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,875 
Die alone here.

213
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,791 
Die alone at home.

214
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,000 
God, you need a girlfriend, man.

215
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,875 
(men shouting)

216
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:44,750 
Those voices are heading our

217
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:44,750 
way. They're almost on us.

218
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,041 
Who the hell

219
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,041 
is this Poseidon guy?

220
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,208 
A psychopath.

221
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:52,041 
A frustrated policy wonk

222
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:52,041 
in the CIA

223
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,500 
who felt he could do better

224
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,500 
than his superiors.

225
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,458 
So he created a cell

226
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,458 
within the CIA called 21-Void,

227
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,166 
implementing his own

228
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,166 
intelligence operations.

229
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,833 
And he needed my help

230
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,125 
breaking out people

231
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,125 
imprisoned all over the world.

232
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,750 
Terrorists,

233
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,375 
political dissidents...

234
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,750 
...rogue agents...

235
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,416 
and if I did it, you and Sara,

236
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,416 
you'd go free.

237
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,166 
Your record's expunged,

238
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:27,750 
but... there was a rub.

239
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,750 
I wasn't allowed to have

240
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,750 
contact with any of you,

241
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,250 
including my son.

242
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,125 
Michael.

243
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:41,750 
So, Michael Scofield

244
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:41,750 
was dead and...

245
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,208 
...over the years

246
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,208 
I assumed many names.

247
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:50,083 
Kaniel Outis... the most recent.

248
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,791 
Why didn't you tell me?

249
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,416 
Why didn't you reach out to me?

250
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,416 
I didn't have a choice.

251
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,208 
Poseidon made that...

252
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,208 
very clear.

253
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,958 
How?

254
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,333 
At first, I said no.

255
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,333 
I wouldn't do it.

256
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:13,000 
<i>Then within weeks,</i>

257
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:13,000 
<i>Sara was incarcerated, beaten.</i>

258
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,958 
And so I gave in.

259
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,666 
Everything I did,

260
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,666 
I did for family,

261
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,708 
for you, for Sara,

262
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,041 
for Mike.

263
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,041 
So none of you would ever have

264
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,041 
to spend another day

265
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,791 
inside a prison cell or...

266
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,791 
or live a life on the run.

267
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,125 
Look at us now.

268
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,750 
(crash above)

269
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,208 
They're starting to

270
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,208 
search the buildings.

271
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,291 
Train station.

272
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,291 
Airport.

273
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,291 
Train station.

274
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,458 
(people clamoring)

275
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,791 
GATE ATTENDANT: All passengers

276
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,791 
must present a ticket.

277
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:59,041 
All passengers must

278
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:59,041 
present a ticket.

279
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:59,041 
(man grunts)

280
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,458 
Never gonna get to our seats.

281
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,458 
We need to go through there.

282
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,375 
Even the pilot

283
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,375 
can't get on the plane.

284
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,208 
C-
285
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,208 
full of planes.

286
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,375 
There's got to be others.

287
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,375 
It's no good.

288
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,625 
People will die here today.

289
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,875 
We need another option.

290
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,416 
My man, Omar.

291
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,416 
Omar?

292
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,791 
That slippery brother?

293
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,625 
Trust is a luxury

294
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,625 
right now.

295
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,416 
He can be trusted. To a point.

296
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,416 
He has connections on

297
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,250 
the western coast,

298
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,250 
across the desert.

299
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,250 
No.

300
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,791 
Lincoln and Michael are

301
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,791 
coming here. That's the plan.

302
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,000 
They don't have a

303
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,000 
next move if we leave.

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,625 
Now they're out there somewhere,

305
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,625 
God knows where.

306
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,708 
Your friends are too late.

307
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,708 
Look around you.

308
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,166 
This airport

309
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,166 
is no good to them.

310
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,000 
We're not leaving.

311
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,041 
(gunfire in distance)

312
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,666 
What is that place?

313
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,083 
Where the

314
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,083 
westerners went

315
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,333 
when they made

316
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,333 
their escape.

317
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,291 
I ran into one

318
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,291 
at the Forger's Den.

319
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,791 
I can help.

320
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,250 
And how do you expect

321
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,250 
to find the foreigners

322
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,500 
with only one eye?

323
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,916 
(car engine starts)

324
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,500 
They're here.

325
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,500 
ISIL are here!

326
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,916 
(crowd clamoring)

327
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,833 
C-
328
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,833 
I have an idea.

329
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,916 
The pilot.

330
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,916 
Okay, follow me.

331
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,916 
Follow me!

332
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,708 
Don't lose him.

333
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,708 
Don't lose the pilot.

334
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,416 
C-
335
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,416 
Come on, come on.

336
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,750 
Come on, come on,

337
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,750 
come on, come on.

338
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,750 
No, just stay down.

339
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,125 
Okay. Wait here.

340
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,375 
What?

341
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,375 
I'll be back.

342
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,708 
Benjamin...

343
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,708 
I'm going alone.

344
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,041 
Don't do it.

345
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,625 
(engine revving)

346
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,625 
(tires screech)

347
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,625 
ISIL SOLDIER:

348
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,625 
Halt!

349
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,875 
What are you doing here?

350
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,833 
On your knees!

351
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,833 
Halt!

352
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,708 
Come out.

353
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,708 
Come out.

354
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,166 
Who are you?

355
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,166 
Papers.

356
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,250 
Don't shoot.

357
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,250 
Don't shoot.

358
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,250 
Papers.

359
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,375 
SHEBA:

360
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,375 
Infidels!

361
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,958 
The infidels

362
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,958 
are in the airport.

363
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,291 
The killers of Ramal!

364
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,291 
I've seen them with my own eyes.

365
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,750 
What?

366
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,750 
I want my reward.

367
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,250 
The ten million rial.

368
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,250 
I will be rich.

369
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,000 
ISIL SOLDIER:

370
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,000 
Take us to them.

371
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,000 
Not until you promise

372
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,291 
I will get my

373
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,291 
ten million rial.

374
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,666 
If you speak the truth,

375
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,666 
you'll have the money.

376
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,125 
(grunting)

377
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,291 
(ISIL solider choking)

378
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,583 
You kick a lot of ass

379
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,583 
for a good Muslim.

380
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,708 
You can take the man

381
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,708 
out of the streets,

382
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,333 
but you can't take

383
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,333 
the streets of the man.

384
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,416 
PILOT: Why do you help me?

385
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,416 
Who are you?

386
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,416 
I'm a man,

387
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,416 
just like you,

388
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,333 
trying to get out

389
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,333 
of this madness,

390
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,750 
but we're not gonna get

391
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,750 
out through those gates.

392
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,000 
The only way out now

393
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,041 
is up, brother.

394
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,708 
The 747 is done.

395
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,958 
It's been secured

396
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,958 
by the rebels.

397
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,250 
I'm not talking

398
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,250 
about Yemenia Air.

399
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,500 
I have my eyes

400
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,958 
on a different

401
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,958 
set of wings.

402
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,458 
(door opens)

403
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,500 
Mom?

404
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,500 
Hey.

405
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,500 
JACOB'S FATHER: Sara!

406
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,750 
You scared us.

407
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,250 
Sorry.

408
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,250 
Is everything all right?

409
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,666 
Yeah, no, It's fine.

410
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,666 
I just... It's been a crazy day,

411
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,375 
made more so by the fact that

412
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,375 
I forgot Mike's Spanish lesson.

413
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,083 
MIKE: Spanish?

414
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,083 
SARA: Yeah.

415
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,958 
That's not today.

416
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,958 
We're gonna talk about

417
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,958 
it in the car, okay?

418
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,500 
Are you sure?

419
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,500 
Is everything okay?

420
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,458 
SARA: Really. Yes.

421
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,458 
We're fine. Thank you.

422
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,375 
Well, let me

423
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,375 
get Mike's bag.

424
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,541 
No, no, don't worry about it.

425
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,541 
I'll get it tomorrow.

426
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,541 
(car door opens)

427
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,125 
I want you to get in the car

428
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,125 
and no matter what...

429
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,125 
Hey.

430
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,583 
you don't get out, okay?

431
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,583 
Hey, hey, hey!

432
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,583 
Where you going so fast?

433
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,125 
Get in.

434
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,958 
Thank you.

435
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,750 
How was that department

436
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,750 
meeting yesterday?

437
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,708 
You usually

438
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,708 
meet with killers?

439
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,250 
Sara. Sara.

440
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,250 
Please, please, please.

441
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,958 
I can explain, okay?

442
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,958 
Just listen to me.

443
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,416 
I was sick with worry.

444
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,166 
I needed to protect you,

445
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,166 
to-to protect our family,

446
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,041 
so I picked up

447
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,041 
your phone from the shop

448
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,500 
and I took it

449
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,500 
to Andrew Nelson,

450
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500 
my buddy in the computer

451
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500 
sciences department.

452
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,000 
He did a deep dive,

453
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,625 
some kind of data archaeology,

454
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,625 
and he did it.

455
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,875 
He tracked

456
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,875 
those bastards down.

457
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,833 
Got their

458
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,833 
cell information.

459
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,750 
So... so I called them,

460
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,125 
thinking I could-I could maybe

461
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,750 
make a-make a deal with them.

462
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,750 
You called them.

463
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,958 
Sara?

464
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,208 
Sara, please, listen to me.

465
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,333 
Sara, this was for you.

466
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,625 
You're gonna want to get out

467
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,625 
of the way right now.

468
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,541 
Sara. Sara!

469
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,166 
MICHAEL:

470
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,166 
<i>This is it.</i>

471
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,875 
Our ticket out of

472
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,875 
the country.

473
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,750 
LINCOLN: I'm telling you,

474
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,750 
Michael, this is a bad idea.

475
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,208 
ISIL are everywhere.

476
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,875 
MICHAEL:

477
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,875 
No, I can do this.

478
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,500 
You really paid the equivalent

479
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,500 
of ten million rial

480
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,041 
for some dude's ashes?

481
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,000 
Not just any ashes, man.

482
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,750 
Freddie Mercury's ashes.

483
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,375 
I would've paid

484
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,375 
twice that.

485
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,750 
MICHAEL:

486
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,750 
Come on.

487
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,416 
Keep your head down.

488
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,583 
I think it's time we get sane

489
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,583 
and head to the airport.

490
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,958 
No, no, no.

491
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,500 
This is better.

492
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,500 
They control the station.

493
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,625 
They'll never think

494
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,625 
to look for us here now.

495
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,500 
They're repurposing

496
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,500 
those trains for cargo,

497
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,750 
not passengers.

498
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,166 
Once we're on, it's...

499
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,041 
it's a straight shot

500
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,041 
to the north.

501
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,750 
They won't check

502
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,750 
the cars again.

503
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,166 
That's what you see

504
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,166 
when you see the train?

505
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,833 
I see a bunch of dudes

506
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,833 
with AK-47s

507
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,041 
who don't look a thing like us.

508
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,041 
Do you really believe

509
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,458 
we can survive

510
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,458 
300 miles on a train

511
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,916 
through ISIL territory?

512
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,541 
Now, that's suicide.

513
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,000 
It does seem risky.

514
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,000 
No kidding.

515
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,166 
No, no.

516
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,375 
We get in that line of cargo

517
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,375 
carriers. Keep our heads down.

518
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,958 
Once we're on the train,

519
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,958 
lay low the rest of the trip.

520
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,208 
Besides, we don't need

521
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,208 
to look like them.

522
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,166 
Tell the believing men

523
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,166 
to lower their gaze

524
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,708 
and be modest.

525
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,583 
Come on.

526
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,708 
From the Koran.

527
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,375 
CYCLOPS:

528
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,375 
All the roads are blocked.

529
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:06,208 
So you'll have to find

530
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:06,208 
a different way to the border.

531
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,000 
(gasps)

532
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,250 
By train!

533
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,333 
Heather, what now?

534
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,833 
What now?

535
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,375 
I mean, it was all a lie.

536
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,708 
Wasn't it? Everything.

537
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,291 
Our whole life,

538
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,291 
our whole marriage.

539
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,000 
He was standing as close

540
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,000 
as you were to me right now,

541
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,458 
and he was chatting

542
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,458 
with the woman who shot him.

543
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,958 
You're saying he planned

544
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,958 
to get himself shot

545
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,500 
like it was some sort of,

546
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,500 
uh, sick performance?

547
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500 
I don't know. I don't know.

548
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,166 
I mean, I...

549
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,208 
Yes. Yes, it was.

550
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,208 
But he almost died.

551
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,250 
So, the plan was

552
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,250 
to wing him, right?

553
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,583 
To just put him above suspicion,

554
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,583 
but the shot went wide.

555
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,666 
He gets hit.

556
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,750 
He knows that he's

557
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,750 
married to a doctor.

558
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,750 
Sara, Sara, stop. Stop.

559
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,333 
You haven't slept in

560
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,333 
three days, right?

561
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,375 
You're upset about

562
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,375 
the home invasion

563
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,708 
and you're tying

564
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,708 
yourself up in knots

565
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,583 
because the love

566
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,583 
of your life,

567
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,083 
the father of your baby,

568
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,083 
might be alive.

569
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,166 
(voice breaking): And I can't

570
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,166 
get through to Lincoln.

571
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,208 
But I saw that video.

572
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,458 
It's him.

573
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,500 
Okay, and I...

574
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,500 
That's Michael.

575
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,375 
And I believe you. I do.

576
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,750 
And that matters.

577
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,291 
That's all that matters.

578
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,666 
No, I know.

579
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,416 
But Jacob is a good man.

580
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,458 
He's your husband.

581
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,458 
(phone ringing)

582
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,250 
Yeah.

583
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,250 
And he helped you

584
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,250 
start a new life.

585
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,666 
Together.

586
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,791 
And that's him.

587
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,541 
I have to answer it.

588
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,541 
No. No.

589
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,666 
No, you don't.

590
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,666 
HEATHER (on machine): Leave a

591
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,666 
message and we'll get back.

592
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,250 
(answering machine beeps)

593
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,375 
JACOB: <i>Heather, Heather?</i>

594
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,375 
<i>Is Sara there?</i>

595
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,833 
<i>Please, I-I need</i>

596
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,833 
<i>to speak with her.</i>

597
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,458 
<i>Look, there's been</i>

598
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,458 
<i>a huge misunderstanding</i>

599
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,708 
<i>and I can explain everything.</i>

600
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,916 
<i>Will you just...</i>

601
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,916 
<i>will you tell her that?</i>

602
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,166 
<i>And to call me?</i>

603
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,458 
He's tracking me.

604
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,541 
Oh, Sara, honey.

605
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,541 
I'm your best friend.

606
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,500 
Of-of course he's gonna

607
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,500 
call here first.

608
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,875 
It doesn't make

609
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,875 
him Deep Throat.

610
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,958 
Listen,

611
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,708 
let's just see if there's

612
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,708 
a simpler explanation.

613
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,250 
Hmm?

614
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,416 
Okay.

615
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,833 
What was the name of that

616
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,833 
computer tech that he mentioned?

617
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,708 
Uh... Andrew.

618
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,458 
Nelson. Andrew Nelson.

619
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,750 
Okay, well, I have an old friend

620
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,750 
in that department.

621
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,375 
We can find out

622
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,833 
if Jacob's full of it

623
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,833 
in one call.

624
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,416 
Okay.

625
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:28,458 
(indistinct conversations)

626
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,708 
You!

627
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,291 
These boots, they should be

628
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,291 
donated to "the cause".

629
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,833 
Take them off.

630
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,708 
Give them here.

631
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,291 
They are the only boots he has.

632
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,041 
What do I care?

633
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,708 
He can answer for himself.

634
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,916 
(grunting, men shouting)

635
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,125 
(woman yelling)

636
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,625 
(shouting in Arabic)

637
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,458 
(train horn blaring)

638
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,708 
Get on the other side

639
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,708 
of that train!

640
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,416 
WHIP: Come on,

641
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,416 
come on, come on,

642
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,208 
come on,

643
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,208 
come on!

644
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,958 
(train horn blaring)

645
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,375 
MICHAEL:

646
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,375 
Come on, let's go.

647
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,083 
(camera shutter clicks)

648
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:54,250 
(phone rings)

649
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,750 
What do you want?

650
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,666 
Look at the picture

651
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,666 
I just sent you.

652
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,041 
<i>I can see the murderers now.</i>

653
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,708 
Where?

654
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,500 
Not so fast.

655
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500 
Bring your weapons,

656
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500 
I will stay on them.

657
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,958 
And I call the shots now.

658
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,958 
PILOT:

659
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,958 
We checked. There's enough fuel

660
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,958 
to get us out of Yemen.

661
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,791 
(speaks Arabic)

662
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,958 
C-
663
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,958 
an old bird like this?

664
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,166 
PILOT:

665
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,166 
We'll find out.

666
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,125 
(men yelling in Arabic)

667
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,208 
MICHAEL:

668
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,208 
<i>There's another station,</i>

669
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,541 
30 miles

670
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,541 
outside Sana'a.

671
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,916 
We can find a way there,

672
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,916 
hop a train.

673
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,041 
They won't anticipate us

674
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,041 
coming that way.

675
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,791 
Doubling down

676
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,791 
on a bad bet.

677
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,541 
Just like you did

678
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,500 
seven years back

679
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,500 
with the CIA.

680
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,416 
Look around you.

681
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,458 
Your plans affect people,

682
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,458 
you don't even see it.

683
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,458 
I don't blame you

684
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,458 
for resenting me.

685
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,541 
You're damn right

686
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,541 
I resent you.

687
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,958 
I see it, Linc.

688
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,958 
I see it.

689
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,750 
Every second

690
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,750 
of every day,

691
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,583 
the people,

692
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,583 
the collateral damage,

693
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,000 
the lives I've...

694
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,000 
affected.

695
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,625 
(engine turning over)

696
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,875 
<i>But I can't start thinking</i>

697
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,875 
<i>about that.</i>

698
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,458 
<i>Because if I do,</i>

699
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,625 
<i>then it all falls apart</i>

700
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,583 
and none of us

701
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,583 
get to go home.

702
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,250 
I have to stay focused,

703
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,166 
be the man with the plan.

704
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,583 
Just like Fox River.

705
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,125 
(engine revving)

706
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,125 
Remember?

707
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,583 
(whistles)

708
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,583 
We got wheels.

709
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,583 
MICHAEL:

710
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,583 
Good work.

711
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,458 
The airport's the only play.

712
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,666 
The airport

713
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,666 
is five miles away.

714
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,125 
The border is hundreds.

715
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,166 
Look,

716
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,916 
the airport might be

717
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,916 
the right choice,

718
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,750 
but I trust

719
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,750 
my instincts.

720
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,375 
They've gotten us

721
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,375 
this far.

722
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,875 
And my gut says

723
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,875 
we can still make it out through

724
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,875 
the north. Choice is yours.

725
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,541 
WHIP:

726
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,541 
Look, man,

727
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,875 
I agree with you, even if

728
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,875 
I don't know you from Adam.

729
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,083 
But...

730
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,791 
got to go

731
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,791 
with the horse

732
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,333 
that got you here,

733
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,333 
you know? So...

734
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,750 
he's my horse.

735
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,541 
Craziest horse I've ever met.

736
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,500 
But got us this far.

737
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,625 
Crazy only works

738
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,875 
if it doesn't get you killed.

739
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,666 
(door opens)

740
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,666 
HEATHER: Andrew?

741
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,041 
Uh, Professor Hayden told us

742
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,041 
to speak with you?

743
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,791 
ANDREW: Oh, yeah.

744
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,791 
Uh, yeah, right.

745
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,833 
Sorry.

746
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,583 
Uh, hi, Andrew.

747
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,541 
I'm Sara Scofield.

748
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,791 
Thanks for taking

749
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,791 
the time.

750
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,625 
By any chance,

751
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,458 
did my husband Jacob Ness ask

752
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,458 
you to work on my cell phone?

753
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:50,625 
Yeah, he did, uh, yesterday.

754
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,083 
What did he, uh...

755
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,875 
what did he ask

756
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,875 
you to do?

757
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,666 
Uh, he said he was looking to

758
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,666 
find the contact information

759
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,791 
for the people who were

760
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,791 
stalking his wife.

761
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,791 
So I did a data dive

762
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,791 
and gave him what I could find.

763
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,791 
How?

764
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:07,208 
They hacked your phone

765
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:07,208 
and lifted the data,

766
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:10,416 
but in the process, left a

767
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:10,416 
very slight electronic signature

768
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,541 
that I was able to

769
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,541 
track back to them.

770
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,833 
Wait, who are "they"?

771
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,500 
Don't know.

772
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,500 
It was a dummy IP address,

773
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,833 
but the cell

774
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,833 
and location were correct.

775
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,083 
They couldn't hide that

776
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,083 
from me.

777
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,666 
(phone rings)

778
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,625 
(sighs, scoffs)

779
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,833 
The man himself.

780
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,291 
(phone continues ringing)

781
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,291 
(phone beeps)

782
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,708 
Hello.

783
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,916 
Sara, listen,

784
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,916 
I know you're upset,

785
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:40,541 
but I need you to come to the

786
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:40,541 
Whitney Heights police station

787
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:41,833 
right now.

788
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,333 
<i>Please.</i>

789
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,500 
So, now we got

790
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,500 
some time to talk.

791
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,333 
Um...

792
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,375 
Well, your name's Michael.

793
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,125 
Cool.

794
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,833 
You have a brother.

795
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,208 
What else

796
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,208 
don't I know?

797
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:11,250 
Serious, I need to know.

798
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:11,250 
I've been traveling so fast,

799
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,041 
for so long, I didn't even stop

800
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,041 
to think who you really are

801
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,583 
or what we're real

802
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,583 
doing here.

803
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,791 
I don't even know why

804
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:17,500 
you dragged me

805
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:17,500 
into all this, you know?

806
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,708 
You got to forget the past,

807
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,708 
Whip, the details.

808
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,083 
None of that matters now.

809
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,291 
What have my actions been

810
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,291 
all these years?

811
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,875 
Who's been taking care of you

812
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,916 
through everything, huh?

813
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,333 
Me. Right?

814
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,833 
Right?

815
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,041 
Yeah.

816
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,458 
Nothing changes.

817
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,875 
You're still my whip hand...

818
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,583 
Whip hand, yeah, I know,

819
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,583 
I'm your whip hand.

820
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,625 
It's-it's not good enough

821
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,625 
this time, man.

822
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,666 
Can you just give it

823
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,666 
to me straight?

824
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,083 
You know, I'm a big boy,

825
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,083 
I can handle it.

826
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,000 
There's a reason

827
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,000 
you're my whip hand.

828
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,041 
A reason that's gonna

829
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,041 
change your life.

830
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,208 
There's a light at the end

831
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,208 
of the tunnel for you.

832
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:57,000 
(all grunting, gasping)

833
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,208 
LINCOLN:

834
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,208 
What the hell was that?

835
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,500 
WHIP:

836
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,500 
Oh, son of a bitch.

837
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,708 
LINCOLN:

838
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,708 
We got to go.

839
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,791 
Let's go!

840
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,375 
(speaking Arabic)

841
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,000 
(shouting in Arabic)

842
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,500 
There's no way out.

843
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,500 
WHIP:

844
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,500 
Back of the hospital's

845
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,250 
been shelled to rubble.

846
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,250 
It's blocked.

847
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,083 
Upstairs is

848
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,083 
blocked, too.

849
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,250 
We're gonna go

850
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,250 
downstairs.

851
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,958 
Look for a way out.

852
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,375 
You do the same.

853
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,500 
Thanks.

854
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:56,375 
What's going on?

855
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,875 
Sara, just...

856
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,666 
just come with us.

857
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,416 
You'll see. Please.

858
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:12,958 
Hello, ma'am.

859
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:12,958 
Um, Sara Scofield?

860
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:14,333 
Yes, sir.

861
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,625 
Thanks for coming in,

862
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,625 
I'm Detective Keenan.

863
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,375 
We'd like you to point out

864
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,375 
who broke into your home.

865
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,583 
And...

866
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,916 
the one who shot

867
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,916 
your husband.

868
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:28,875 
It's three and four.

869
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,250 
The man and the woman

870
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,250 
was the shooter.

871
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,000 
Are you sure?

872
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,375 
Yes, sir.

873
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:43,916 
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

874
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,125 
There's got to be a way out.

875
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,166 
Something... something that

876
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,166 
connects to the surface.

877
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,875 
Going down's not

878
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,875 
gonna work, Michael.

879
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,250

We can't wait.

1158

There won't be enough runway

five more minutes.

1169

Okay?

1170
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,750 
And then we take care

1171
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,750 
of the souls that we can.

1172
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,375 
Understand?

1173
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:13,125 
What the hell are you doing?

Shut it down.

1178

Shut it down!

1179
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,500 
You would condemn us all

1180
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,500 
to death.

1181
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,875 
If you stop me, no one gets out.

1182

Your friends can still make it

1183
