00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,958 
I didn't think

179
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,875 
I was ever gonna

180
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,875 
see you again.

181
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,333 
You didn't come

182
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,333 
to the wedding.

183
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,666 
I mean, I...

184
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,666 
I figured I, I get it--

185
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,458 
he hates me for marrying someone

186
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,458 
other than his brother, but...

187
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,500 
I haven't been

188
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,500 
in a good place, Sara.

189
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,000 
My brain, it's, it's,

190
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,000 
it's been a mess.

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,291 
That's why I didn't show up.

192
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,833 
And I didn't want my nephew

193
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,833 
to see me like that.

194
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,625 
(sighs quietly)

195
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,750 
But now it's impossible

196
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,750 
to stay away.

197
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,625 
SARA: Someone's got

198
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,625 
a sick sense of humor.

199
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,791 
I know you want it to be true.

200
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,583 
Losing a brother--

201
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,875 
the massive hole

202
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,875 
that leaves in your life.

203
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,791 
Like the same massive hole

204
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,791 
losing a husband makes.

205
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,291 
(sighs)

206
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,333 
Maybe.

207
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,333 
(door opens, closes)

208
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,958 
Lincoln Burrows?

209
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,083 
Jacob.

210
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,291 
I haven't seen

211
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,291 
you in what,

212
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,458 
three, four years?

213
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,458 
Yeah.

214
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,458 
MIKE: Uncle Lincoln!

215
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,708 
Hey-hey! Buddy!

216
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,166 
Oh...

217
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,833 
so good to see you.

218
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,500 
Did you bring me

219
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,500 
any sunken treasures?

220
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,125 
"Sunken treasures"?

221
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,375 
Oh. The dive shop.

222
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,166 
Panama.

223
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,166 
Yeah, I've been

224
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,166 
telling him stories

225
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,916 
about being down there before

226
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,916 
we came back to the States.

227
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,416 
You've become kind of like

228
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,250 
a mythological hero to him.

229
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,250 
Let me get some beers.

230
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,708 
I want to know what

231
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,708 
you been up to.

232
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,708 
Sure, man. Yeah.

233
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,916 
Okay.

234
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,916 
Come here.

235
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,875 
I want you to go wash up, okay?

236
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,083 
And then you can catch up

237
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,083 
with your uncle.

238
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,250 
He hasn't just

239
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,250 
mythologized you.

240
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,041 
He mythologizes

241
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,041 
Michael, too.

242
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,833 
It's like someone thinking

243
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,833 
he was born to a god,

244
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,291 
a god he's never met...

245
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,666 
and who isn't here.

246
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,583 
And who never will be again.

247
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,208 
I can be pragmatic.

248
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,541 
Michael was sick.

249
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,958 
He was terminally sick.

250
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,375 
And he died.

251
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,750 
(sighs)

252
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,416 
Sara...

253
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,375 
how do you explain that?

254
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,750 
(sighs)

255
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,416 
It's Photoshop, Linc,

256
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,375 
or something.

257
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,125 
You got to consider

258
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,125 
the source.

259
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,500 
This came

260
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,500 
from T-Bag.

261
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,666 
I know you want

262
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,666 
it to be true.

263
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:22,291 
I want it to be true.

264
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,208 
(loud, indistinct music plays

265
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,208 
in next room)

266
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,291 
How about a date tonight,

267
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,291 
model citizen?

268
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,500 
(groans)

269
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,333 
(sighs)

270
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,333 
A little well-earned love

271
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,333 
after a long time at sea.

272
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,708 
Jeh... boop.

273
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,791 
Miss Dorothy.

274
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,208 
E-mailing her undying love

275
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,500 
from Aurora, Illinois.

276
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,125 
I-eesh.

277
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,750 
(sighs)

278
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,750 
How about this one?

279
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,208 
"Love Cannon Alonzo

280
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,208 
in Champaign."

281
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,125 
Ooh. Hop on that

282
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,125 
just on the name alone.

283
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,125 
(computer chimes)

284
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,083 
What the hell?

285
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,541 
Prosthetic research?

286
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,666 
(sighs)

287
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,666 
(crow caws, birds sing)

288
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,666 
Smart girl, your Sara.

289
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,166 
She's right.

290
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,041 
I'm just desperate

291
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,041 
to see your face.

292
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:28,375 
<i>My life's been a mess</i>

293
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:28,375 
<i>ever since you left.</i>

294
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,000 
Fallen back into my old ways.

295
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,833 
<i>Something</i>

296
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,833 
<i>you wouldn't tolerate.</i>

297
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,250 
But I got good in me, Michael.

298
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,541 
I got good in me.

299
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,750 
(Lincoln sighs heavily)

300
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,208 
<i>It'd just be nice if</i>

301
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,416 
you were here to...

302
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,416 
help me find it.

303
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,541 
So... yeah.

304
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,000 
(crow caws)

305
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,041 
"Ogygia."

306
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,875 
(keyboard keys clicking loudly)

307
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,791 
Telling me where you are.

308
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,791 
There's only one way

309
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,791 
to find out.

310
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,875 
(groans)

311
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,958 
MAN:

312
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,958 
Theodore Bagwell.

313
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,458 
And you're Dr. Whitcombe,

314
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,291 
the man who invited me

315
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,291 
to this mystery meeting

316
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:14,041 
at 9:30 at night when the rest

317
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:14,041 
of the building's closed.

318
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,083 
I know what you've done.

319
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,000 
That's why I don't want to be

320
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,000 
seen associating with your sort.

321
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,166 
Just want to know

322
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,166 
why I'm here, and...

323
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,583 
if this has anything

324
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,583 
to do with that special envelope

325
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,958 
I received in the prison.

326
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,250 
I know nothing

327
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,250 
about an envelope.

328
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,833 
I can only tell

329
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,833 
you my work.

330
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,500 
Targeted muscle reinnervation.

331
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,541 
Using the brain

332
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,541 
to manipulate prosthesis

333
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,458 
as it were a natural limb.

334
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,375 
But as with any

335
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,375 
cutting-edge work,

336
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,166 
funding is not easy

337
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,166 
to find, and yet,

338
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,083 
incredibly, I got the grant

339
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,083 
in the form of a

340
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,083 
considerable anonymous grant

341
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,708 
on one condition--

342
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,250 
the first recipient

343
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,250 
of my procedure...

344
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,958 
is you.

345
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,875 
I can equip you

346
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,291 
with a fully articulate

347
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,291 
prosthetic,

348
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,916 
operationally indistinguishable

349
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,916 
from a real hand.

350
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:07,500 
All of this because

351
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:07,500 
of an anonymous donor?

352
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,875 
Someone seems to have plans

353
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,875 
for both of us.

354
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,875 
I've reserved an

355
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,875 
operational lab for Monday

356
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,500 
if you decide

357
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,500 
you are interested.

358
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,333 
It's your hand, ultimately.

359
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,416 
By your hand,

360
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:35,333 
you shall know glories

361
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:35,333 
of your progeny.

362
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,833 
What's that?

363
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,916 
Nothing, Doc.

364
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,333 
(panting)

365
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,875 
(shovel thudding hollowly)

366
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,333 
(shovel clanks on ground)

367
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,583 
(grunting)

368
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,500 
(creaking)

369
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,625 
(panting)

370
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,208 
Come on, Michael.

371
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,166 
You must have left me something.

372
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,958 
Come on!

373
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,791 
(panting)

374
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,583 
Come on.

375
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,958 
(panting)

376
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,166 
(sniffs, panting)

377
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,041 
(brakes squeak)

378
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,375 
(computer chirps)

379
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,416 
(clack, tires squeal)

380
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,625 
(computer chirps)

381
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:26,875 
What's going on?

382
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,208 
(groans)

383
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,541 
(groans)

384
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,000 
(groans, tires squealing,

385
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,000 
horns honking)

386
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,958 
(groans)

387
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,458 
(grunts)

388
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,583 
(loud gasping)

389
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,541 
(water gurgling)

390
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,500 
(groans, pants)

391
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,250 
(vehicle approaching)

392
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,666 
(panting)

393
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,333 
Oh, my God,

394
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,333 
what happened?

395
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,083 
I'm not sure.

396
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,083 
I'm gonna call

397
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,500 
the police.

398
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,500 
(man speaks indistinctly)

399
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,916 
(panting)

400
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,125 
(indistinct chatter,

401
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,125 
car door opens, closes)

402
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,416 
(car engine starts)

403
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,250 
(phone ringing)

404
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,666 
Hello?

405
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,083 
I dug up Michael's grave.

406
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,083 
He's not in it.

407
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,708 
He... What?

408
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,250 
Sara, someone just

409
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,250 
tried to kill me.

410
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,541 
<i>They've been watching.</i>

411
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,541 
<i>They've been watching,</i>

412
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,916 
<i>probably for... </i>

413
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,916 
Who tried to kill you?

414
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,833 
It started at the airport. I...

415
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,208 
There was a... a red sedan.

416
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,583 
It started following me.

417
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,541 
<i>Then they, they, they swapped</i>

418
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,958 
down to a...

419
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,791 
What was it?

420
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,791 
A pickup.

421
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,541 
(vehicle engine approaching)

422
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,458 
What color was the pickup?

423
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,500 
LINCOLN:

424
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,500 
<i>Black.</i>

425
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,458 
<i>Why?</i>

426
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,458 
(phone beeps off)

427
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,708 
(dial tone sounds)

428
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,708 
Sara?

429
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,958 
Jacob?

430
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,625 
Yeah.

431
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,625 
Behind one of

432
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,833 
the pictures on the brick wall,

433
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,333 
there's a hole, and there's

434
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,208 
a gun in it. I need

435
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,208 
you to get it.

436
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,208 
What?!

437
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,875 
Right now! Right now!

438
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,875 
Someone's coming for us!

439
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:30,000 
A gun? What do you mean, a gun?

440
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,458 
Mike?

441
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,458 
(touch tones sounding)

442
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,875 
WOMAN:

443
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,875 
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

444
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,458 
I have an armed intruder

445
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,458 
in the house.

446
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,583 
I need you to send people

447
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,583 
right away.

448
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,416 
I don't have time.

449
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,416 
Please, come.

450
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,083 
Mike?

451
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,083 
JACOB:

452
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,083 
Sara?

453
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,375 
What's going on, Sara?

454
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,333 
(panting)

455
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,333 
Hey.

456
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,750 
Mom?

457
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,750 
Come here.

458
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,458 
(door slams open)

459
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,791 
(panting)

460
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,208 
Sara? Sara!

461
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,041 
(panting)

462
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,500 
(Jacob groans)

463
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,333 
(Jacob groaning)

464
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,000 
(pained groaning)

465
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000 
It's just me. There's no one

466
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000 
else in the house.

467
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,250 
JACOB:

468
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,250 
What do you want?

469
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,250 
Get in the tub.

470
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,458 
Who's here, Mom?

471
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,458 
What do they want?

472
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,125 
(Jacob groaning)

473
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,125 
I don't know, baby.

474
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,791 
(door squeaks open)

475
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,083 
(metal creaking, Sara groans)

476
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,416 
Okay, listen to me,

477
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,416 
if anyone comes

478
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,625 
through that door,

479
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,625 
you don't move, okay?

480
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,208 
I will put this through them,

481
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,208 
and you will not be harmed.

482
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,291 
You understand?

483
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,291 
Good boy.

484
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,208 
(sirens wailing in distance)

485
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,208 
(groans)

486
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,791 
Jacob?

487
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,041 
(Jacob groans)

488
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,333 
MIKE:

489
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,333 
Mom.

490
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,750 
Go get every towel

491
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,750 
you can find.

492
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,166 
Right now, right now.

493
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,750 
Please, Jacob.

494
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,208 
Okay. I think it got an artery.

495
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,208 
Stay with me.

496
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,041 
I want you to look at me,

497
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,041 
all right?

498
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,791 
Don't close your eyes

499
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,791 
and don't go to sleep,

500
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,125 
all right? I'm gonna need you

501
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,125 
to stay with me.

502
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,375 
I need an ambulance!

503
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,291 
(indistinct chatter)

504
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,333 
How is he?

505
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,333 
The shot almost completely

506
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,583 
severed his femoral artery so

507
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,583 
they're trying to stabilize him.

508
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,083 
And him?

509
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,333 
SARA:

510
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,333 
He's seven.

511
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,791 
How you doing, Mikey?

512
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,250 
Something's happening,

513
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,250 
isn't it?

514
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,708 
First, you come

515
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,791 
and that person

516
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,791 
came in our house.

517
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,875 
It has something to do with

518
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,875 
my real father, doesn't it?

519
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,416 
Why do you say that?

520
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,083 
Because I can see it

521
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,083 
in her face.

522
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,583 
I'm gonna need

523
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,583 
to talk to your uncle.

524
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,666 
I'm gonna be right over there

525
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,416 
where you can see me. Okay?

526
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,583 
What's going on?

527
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,291 
We've awoken something.

528
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,125 
Something people are trying

529
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,125 
to hide about Michael.

530
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,666 
Your brother's dead, Lincoln.

531
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,833 
Or is he dead?

532
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,833 
Where is the body?

533
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,458 
Then why did he leave?

534
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:50,000 
If he's been out there

535
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:50,000 
for all of these years,

536
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,416 
why did he abandon his own son?

537
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,375 
You know I'm right.

538
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,583 
It wouldn't be like this if

539
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,583 
something wasn't happening.

540
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,625 
It wouldn't, but...

541
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,625 
Let's fight back.

542
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,125 
I don't know who we're fighting.

543
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,500 
Let's go to Yemen and find out.

544
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,541 
To Yemen? I have a son, Lincoln.

545
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,958 
My husband's in the ER. Right?

546
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,958 
Look, leaving them is exactly

547
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,416 
the wrong thing

548
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,416 
for me to do right now.

549
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,500 
Ma'am. He's ready to see you.

550
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,791 
One second.

551
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,666 
I'll do it.

552
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,791 
I'll go to Yemen.

553
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,041 
You don't know a damn thing

554
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,041 
about Yemen.

555
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,041 
I'll find someone who does.

556
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,500 
See ya, Mikey.

557
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,208 
(men praying in Arabic)

558
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,291 
(praying continues)

559
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,625 
LINCOLN:

560
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,625 
<i>I envy you.</i>

561
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,875 
<i>You changed your life around.</i>

562
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:54,666 
C-
563
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:54,666 
<i>of living a profligate life.</i>

564
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,208 
<i>So I took up jihad.</i>

565
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,208 
<i>Real jihad,</i>

566
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,250 
<i>not that madness</i>

567
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,250 
<i>that you see on the news.</i>

568
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,833 
<i>War within.</i>

569
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:07,666 
<i>The spiritual struggle</i>

570
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:07,666 
<i>to clean up your act.</i>

571
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,625 
<i>Finding and serving God.</i>

572
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,750 
That's good, man.

573
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,875 
The world needs it, Linc.

574
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:20,166 
I mean we're, uh,

575
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:20,166 
we're small here,

576
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,708 
but we do what we can

577
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,458 
to help the peace efforts

578
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,458 
in the Middle East.

579
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:27,083 
Working on anti-radicalization

580
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:27,083 
campaigns here at home.

581
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,000 
Like I said, the struggle.

582
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,833 
That's why I'm here.

583
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,000 
If I needed

584
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,000 
to get to Yemen,

585
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,625 
that something

586
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,625 
you could help me with?

587
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,458 
C-
588
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,458 
I thought he was dead.

589
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,791 
So did everyone.

590
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,583 
But Ogygia?

591
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,000 
I mean,

592
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,000 
that's for heavy hitters,

593
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,291 
political prisoners.

594
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,750 
In Yemen,

595
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,750 
it doesn't come any worse.

596
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,416 
I mean, do you know what

597
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,416 
it would take to stage a death?

598
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,250 
Not to mention

599
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,250 
keeping a man who is not dead

600
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,291 
under the radar

601
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,291 
for seven years.

602
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,541 
Some very powerful players.

603
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:08,291 
Sayed, what do you make

604
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:08,291 
of this mosque right here?

605
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,708 
Aksa Mosque. It's one of

606
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,708 
the main ones in Sana'a.

607
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,291 
It's very distinct.

608
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,291 
Ah.

609
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,833 
SAYED: Sightlines seem

610
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,833 
pretty consistent

611
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,333 
with what it would probably be

612
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,333 
from the prison to the mosque.

613
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:26,625 
Now, you ask me,

614
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:26,625 
that photo's legit.

615
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:30,541 
Then that's the building

616
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:30,541 
my brother's in.

617
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:33,500 
Easiest way to find out is

618
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:33,500 
to call the prison and ask.

619
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,916 
<i>Mafi </i>Michael Scofield.

620
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,708 
<i>Shukran.</i>

621
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:44,000 
There's no Michael Scofield.

622
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,375 
Punch up an image

623
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,375 
from the Internet.

624
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,958 
Michael Scofield.

625
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,291 
Send it to the prison.

626
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,041 
Maybe he's under

627
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,041 
a different name.

628
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,458 
C-
629
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,458 
Listen, Linc,

630
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,333 
I got to say

631
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,333 
something, man.

632
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:54,875 
Man, you got to

633
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:54,875 
slow your roll.

634
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,250 
Yemen is in a civil war.

635
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,083 
They're really close

636
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,083 
to collapse.

637
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:01,166 
It's no place for a white man

638
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:01,166 
with an American passport,

639
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,000 
no command of Arabic,

640
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,000 
to just show up on a whim.

641
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,291 
And yet, apparently,

642
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,291 
my brother did.

643
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,000 
Got a picture.

644
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,000 
Your brother's intake photo

645
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,416 
from the Fox River Penitentiary.

646
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:17,416 
Here's his DMV photo

647
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,875 
and here's a photo

648
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,875 
from his old workplace Web site.

649
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,291 
LINCOLN:

650
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,291 
It's not him.

651
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,958 
None of them are.

652
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,916 
Someone's erasing him

653
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,916 
from history.

654
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,416 
C-
655
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,416 
<i>Lincoln, where are you going?</i>

656
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:38,250 
Hotel, to grab my stuff, then

657
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:38,250 
the airport.

658
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,708 
Hey, listen, you're

659
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,708 
not going to Yemen.

660
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,833 
Stop me.

661
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,833 
You won't make

662
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,833 
it three days.

663
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,125 
We need to go through

664
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,125 
the proper channels.

665
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,500 
"The proper channels"?

666
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,833 
Someone's erasing

667
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,833 
his existence.

668
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,916 
Who does that?

669
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,916 
Who has that ability?

670
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,291 
I'm telling you,

671
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,291 
Michael's caught

672
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:53,666 
in the middle

673
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:53,666 
of something big.

674
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,458 
What if he's not caught

675
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,458 
in the middle?

676
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:57,375 
What are you saying?

677
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:59,333 
Michael has never

678
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:59,333 
been anyone's sucker.

679
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:02,291 
He's always been

680
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:02,291 
in control. Always.

681
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,958 
You saying

682
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,958 
he faked his own death?

683
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,750 
I'm saying you need to look

684
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,166 
at all of the possibilities,

685
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,000 
before you walk

686
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,000 
into a war zone.

687
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,458 
(sighs)

688
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:23,083 
I wasn't sure you'd come.

689
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:27,666 
Sometimes a man has

690
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:27,666 
to surrender to fate.

691
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:31,125 
See what it has in store

692
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:31,125 
for him.

693
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,750 
(monitor beeping)

694
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,041 
WHITCOMBE:

695
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,041 
We'll need to put you under.

696
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:39,708 
No, no, no. I don't do

697
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:39,708 
general anesthetic, compadre.

698
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,166 
It's mandatory

699
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,166 
for a procedure like this.

700
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,541 
You'll forgive me

701
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:45,583 
if I have a problem

702
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:45,583 
lying unconscious

703
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,250 
before a man with sharp

704
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,250 
items at his disposal.

705
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,333 
It cannot be done

706
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,333 
without a general anesthetic.

707
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,958 
Oh, I've done it

708
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,958 
before, friend.

709
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,291 
And look what it got you.

710
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,333 
(sighs)

711
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,583 
You do anything untoward to me

712
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,583 
while I'm under and I'll...

713
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,375 
You are the last man

714
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,375 
I'd run afoul of.

715
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,875 
Okay?

716
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,875 
Mm.

717
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:06,833 
Oh, fate, you

718
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:06,833 
mysterious bitch.

719
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,500 
Why you doing

720
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,500 
this to me?

721
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:15,250 
(monitor beeping)

722
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,208 
Hi. Dry cleaning.

723
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,208 
Nice jacket.

724
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,583 
Thank you, sir.

725
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:20,958 
Have a good day.

726
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,166 
(door creaks)

727
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,625 
(grunts)

728
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,458 
What the hell was that for?

729
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,458 
Sucre!

730
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,166 
What the hell

731
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,166 
are you doing here?

732
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:53,083 
C... C-Note told me

733
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:53,083 
what's going on.

734
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,833 
He tell you

735
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,833 
to talk me out of it?

736
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:58,333 
No. I'm coming with you.

737
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,916 
LINCOLN:

738
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,916 
You're not coming.

739
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,416 
SUCRE: Michael's my best friend.

740
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,416 
If he's alive,

741
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:02,791 
if he's in trouble,

742
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:02,791 
I want to help.

743
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,166 
Don't you have a

744
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,166 
job or something?

745
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,416 
Yeah, on a tramp.

746
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,416 
Not great work,

747
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:07,833 
but hey,

748
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:07,833 
I'm an ex-con, right?

749
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,166 
Tramp?

750
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,583 
Yeah, I've been riding her

751
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,583 
for a while.

752
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,875 
What are you, a pimp?

753
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,791 
What? No.

754
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,791 
No, no, no.

755
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,833 
A tramp is

756
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,833 
a freelance cargo ship.

757
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,458 
We go to Hong Kong,

758
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,458 
Spain, Buenos Aires,

759
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,875 
basically wherever

760
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,875 
the boss tells us.

761
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:20,375 
Corrupt son of a bitch.

762
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,250 
Well, I suggest you

763
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,250 
get back on that tramp,

764
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,166 
'cause you're not coming.

765
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,166 
I'm telling you I can help!

766
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,000 
Listen to me, this

767
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,000 
is the Middle East.

768
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,166 
Lots has changed.

769
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,166 
I'm an international hitter now.

770
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,583 
A raconteur.

771
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,541 
I don't think that means

772
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,541 
what you think it means.

773
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,375 
Don't speak to me like I don't

774
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,375 
know French, I know French.

775
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,583 
And I'm brown, that's something.

776
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:35,708 
I'll fit in better

777
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:35,708 
over there

778
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,541 
than you will, snowflake.

779
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,166 
I decided I was wrong

780
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,166 
when I said

781
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,083 
you would be dead

782
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,083 
inside of three days.

783
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:44,750 
You go over there,

784
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:44,750 
you'll be dead inside of one.

785
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,083 
But with me,

786
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,083 
we have people at the mosque

787
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,500 
that have worked

788
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,500 
over there,

789
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,916 
people with

790
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,916 
legal connections

791
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:51,625 
that can get us

792
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:51,625 
inside of that prison.

793
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:54,625 
Hold on.

794
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:54,625 
You're not saying he gets to go.

795
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,458 
He's not any browner than I am.

796
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,458 
Ah, but do you speak Arabic?

797
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,458 
Huh?

798
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,208 
No?

799
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,208 
I managed to pick up

800
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,208 
a little Arabic

801
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,208 
while I was serving in Iraq.

802
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,291 
WOMAN: <i>This is the final</i>

803
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,291 
<i>boarding call for Flight 39</i>

804
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,750 
<i>to JFK, connecting to Yemen.</i>

805
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,750 
<i>This is the final boarding...</i>

806
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,458 
Listen, man.

807
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,083 
There's gonna be a time

808
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,083 
when I'm gonna need you.

809
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,583 
(plane taking off in distance)

810
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,958 
You better find him.

811
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:22,791 
And you better call me

812
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:22,791 
when you do.

813
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:24,541 
I will.

814
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,791 
You really

815
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,791 
got contacts?

816
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:33,625 
Contacts with contacts.

817
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,916 
Could just follow 'em

818
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,916 
into the bathroom,

819
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,541 
ragdoll him in one of stalls

820
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,541 
and be done with it.

821
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,541 
(camera snaps)

822
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:45,000 
Then we'd have a body

823
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:45,000 
to deal with.

824
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,750 
And we want him utterly

825
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,666 
and irrevocably gone

826
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,666 
from this world.

827
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:54,375 
Where no amount of digging

828
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:54,375 
will bring him back.

829
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,583 
(yelling, glass breaking)

830
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,125 
(indistinct chatter)

831
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,916 
We're the only ones coming

832
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,916 
into the place.

833
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,666 
C-
834
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,666 
the country's falling apart.

835
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,291 
Everyone wants out.

836
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:13,375 
Who's that contact again?

837
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,583 
A woman named Sheba.

838
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,125 
Our handler.

839
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,375 
She helps us track Americans

840
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,375 
that come in

841
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:18,583 
to fight the jihad fight.

842
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,625 
(explosions, panicked chatter)

843
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,791 
(distant car alarms blaring)

844
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:27,250 
Welcome to the civil war.

845
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,541 
(man whistles loudly)

846
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,583 
Mr. Franklin,

847
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,291 
Ms. Sheba sent me

848
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,291 
to collect you.

849
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,458 
As-salaam alaikum.

850
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:34,750 
<i>Wa alaikum as-salaam.</i>

851
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,333 
Uh, this way, gentlemen.

852
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,333 
Follow me.

853
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:52,916 
GUIDE:

854
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:52,916 
<i>Yemen very dangerous.</i>

855
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,791 
You never know who's enemies,

856
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,791 
who's friends.

857
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,208 
Everyone scratching

858
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,458 
each other's backs.

859
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,583 
ISIL is starting

860
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,583 
to attack the city.

861
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,750 
They have been building up

862
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,750 
out in the desert for months.

863
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,208 
If they take the city,

864
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,041 
they will kill all

865
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,041 
the secularists,

866
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,875 
install Sharia law.

867
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:11,375 
Huh. You know.

868
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,250 
You don't seem worried.

869
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,500 
(chuckles)

870
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,250 
I scratch backs, too, my friend.

871
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,375 
C-
872
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,375 
<i>This isn't right.</i>

873
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,000 
<i>Hey, wait a minute,</i>

874
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,458 
this-this isn't the address.

875
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,375 
I get cigarettes.

876
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,375 
No, no, you don't.

877
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,208 
You take us straight

878
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,208

Arranging such a visit

970
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:49,416

971
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:51,375

Not money.

975

Your passport.

976
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,125

you want to hold it?

979
00:35:57,291 --> 00:36:00,041 
No. Straight trade.

980
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,916 
Visit for your passport.

981
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:04,916 
Uh, U.S. passport

982
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:04,916 
is like gold here.

983
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:07,625 
A few changes, and it can be

984
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:07,625 
a ticket to freedom.

985
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,250 
Don't do it, Linc.

I know it is not

989
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,166 
ideal, but...

990
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,916 
ideals as of right now

991
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,916 
are history in Yemen.

992

999
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,625 
step foot in another prison.

1000
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,208 
As long as we walk out of it.

There's no Michael Scofield.

1008
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,166 
It was a scam

1009
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,166 
to get my passport.

1010
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,250

1012
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,041 
Listen, lady.

1013
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,041 
Trust doesn't seem to mean

1014
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,250 
a whole lot in this country.

1015
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,500 
Give me a second, okay?

1016
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,375 
I'll figure out a way

1017
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,375 
to work this thing out.

1018
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,000 
An image.

1019
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,250 
Right? The one that

1020
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,250 
they sent to you?

1021
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,625 
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1022
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,625 
Do you have it?

1023
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,500 
Look.

1024
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,500 
There.

1025
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,500 
(clears throat)

1026
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,958 
Kaniel Outis.

1027
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:06,875 
Yes, Kaniel Outis.

1028
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:06,875 
Is he here?

1029
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,291 
(speaking in Arabic)

1030
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,375 
He says, yes, the man

1031
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,375 
in the picture is here

1032
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,625 
and we can see him, but only

1033
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,625 
'cause we're dealing with Sheba.

1034
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:20,916 
Why did you say that name?

1035
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:22,708 
Because of my brother's jacket.

1036
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:25,000 
Thought you were on

1037
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:25,000 
the right side of God on this.

1038
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,833 
Sheba. No, hey,

1039
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,833 
hey. Sheba...

1040
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,750 
Hey. Kaniel Outis

1041
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,250 
is a big-time terrorist.

1042
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,791 
They got him in here for murder.

1043
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,125 
He's been working with ISIL

1044
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,500 
trying to take down

1045
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,500 
the government.

1046
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,125 
Come on, C.

1047
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:42,333 
You know that's not Michael.

1048
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:44,625 
Well, whoever he is...

1049
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,041 
...we're about to meet him.

00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,375 
What was my father like?

1053
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,500 
My real father.

1054
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,083 
(sighs)

1055
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,125 
Michael Scofield...

1056
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,958 
<i>...was like a storm.</i>

1057
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:08,708 
Grab the camera.

1058
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,375 
I want to prove he's alive.

1059
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:16,875 
He was beautiful

1060
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:20,333 
and frightening

1061
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,375 
<i>and mysterious.</i>

1062
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:26,291 
<i>And he would show up</i>

1063
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:26,291 
<i>in your life</i>

1064
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,375 
<i>out of the clear blue sky</i>

1065
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:33,083 
and then he would disappear

1066
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:33,083 
just as quickly.

1067
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:35,375 
But storms, they can come back.

1068
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,000 
Can't they?

1069
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,291 
Mm-hmm.

1070
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:47,333 
Question is, if they come back,

1071
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:50,625 
is it the same storm,

1072
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:53,041 
or has something changed?

1073
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,750 
(thunder crashes)

1074
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,291 
Michael.

1075
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,708 
New tats.

1076
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:11,708 
What do you mean, new?

1077
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,416 
We're gonna get you out of here.

1078
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:18,291 
My name isn't Michael.

1079
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,125 
And I don't know who you are.

1080
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,916 
Sorry.

1081
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:31,458 
Guard, take me

1082
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:31,458 
back to the cell.

1083
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,333 
Michael.

1084
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:42,041 
Michael.

1085
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000 
Michael, talk to me. Michael...

1086
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,666 
Mike.

1087
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,458 
Mike! What are you doing,

1088
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,458 
damn it?!

1089
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,625 
(door closes)

1090
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:04,041
